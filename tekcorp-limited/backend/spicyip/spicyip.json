    "data": "Adding another layer of spice to the Basmati rice IP dispute between India and Pakistan, recently the Delhi High Court dismissed the 15 years old suit (pdf) against the export of Basmati rice by India, for non-prosecution from the plaintiff since 2020.As a quick background, this suit was filed seeking an injunction against the Govt. of India’s notification permitting export of “evolved” Basmati Rice under the mark “Super Basmati”. The suit was filed by Trading Corporation of Pakistan Pvt. Ltd., along with Rice Exporters Association of Pakistan and Basmati Growers Association alleging passing off, dilution, and infringement of their transborder reputation by Govt. of India’s allowance to use the trade name “Super Basmati” for rice exported from India.The dispute may seem separate from the longstanding India-Pakistan Basmati GI dispute, but it is (or rather was) very much ingrained into the above controversy. The plaintiffs here were aggrieved by the Government of India’s notification dated May 24, 2006 that declared Super Basmati as an approved evolved Basmati rice under the Export (Quality Control and Inspection) Act, 1963 for export. Important DefinitionsThe term “evolved variety” has been defined under the Export of Basmati Rice (Quality Control and Inspection) Rules 2003 as “a variety whose one of two parent is a traditional variety and which has been recognised as a Basmati variety under any law for the time being in force”. And “traditional variety” has been defined as “land races or varieties of rice of uniform shape size and colour traditionally recognised as Basmati”. Explanation 1 and 2 list out Basmati and traditional Basmati Rice and via the 2006 notification “Super Basmati” was added to these rules as “evolved variety”. Super Basmati has been explained as a “variety that is about 113 cm tall and is weakly photo period sensitive. It performs best under medium fertility conditions. It possesses extra long, super fine grains with excellent cooking quality and strong aroma. The cooked rice is non-sticky and soft to eat. It matures in about 145 days after seeding. Its average yield is 14 quintal of paddy per acre.” And interested readers can refer to this reading to know how it is different from other varieties of Basmati.The order also notes the GI status of Basmati rice, registered in the favor of Agricultural and Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA) (who was also a defendant in the present matter). However, it is interesting to see that the list of approved varieties of Basmati Rice in APEDA’s website does not specify Super Basmati as a variety. Okay so with India’s stake clear now, why did Pakistan file this suit? One of the reasons could be because of the importance of Super Basmati’s export to the world. As per this old 2005 case study by Amir Muhammed and Wajid H. Pirzada, in the context of EU Pakistan has been exporting Basmati rice worth 531 millon USD, 80 percent of which was Super Basmati variety. EU’s role is especially important considering that India and Pakistan are involved in a heated GI dispute in the EU over Basmati rice."

    "data": "The nuances of Section 3(d) continue to plague and please litigants, depending on which side of it they end up falling. One issue that regularly pops up is the clash between filing timelines, and clinical trial data necessary to prove ‘enhanced efficacy’, as required to get by the Section 3(d) barrier. Patent applications are often filed as soon as a potential invention is noticed, while clinical trials take years to complete. Adding to judicial thought on this point, in a recent order in Ischemix Llc vs The Controller Of Patents, the Delhi High Court, noting that written submissions referring to new data are often submitted after final hearings, held that the applicant must clearly place the data to prove enhanced therapeutic efficacy before the Patent Office, prior to the date of the final oral hearing to ensure it is accounted for. Since these matters are technical in nature the court held that the note on enhanced therapeutic efficacy should be handed over and be clearly explained by the Patent Agent to the Examiner during the final hearing. Thereby taking into consideration the human error factor by not holding the examiner responsible for missing out on these crucial details when the same was kept away by the applicant till the 11th hour.Since the Patent Office had agreed to re-examine the application and hear the applicant again, the court did not go into the merits of the appeal. However, the court did direct (relying on the Astrazeneca v. Intas DB order and the Oyster Point Pharma case) that any benefit of relying on the data filed after the priority date should only be allowed if the same has been made in the complete specification of the invention.The order thus seeks to put some order in the Indian patent prosecution scene, especially with regard to pharmaceutical products. By reiterating the clinical trial data can be filed after the date of priority, the order tries to strike a balance between the legitimate inability to produce these data at the time of filing the patent application, but restricting such filing before the date of hearing, the court ensures that such data are not filed last minute which would have defeated the purpose of section 3(d) safeguard."

Sidhi is a final year B.A. LL.B (Hons) student at Hidayatullah National Law University, Raipur. Aadvika is a second year student B.A. LL.B (Hons) at NALSAR University of Law, Hyderabad.]Is “plurality of an invention” indispensable for maintaining a Divisional Application? If so, where should this invention be disclosed? After the divergent understanding of the two Single Benches of the Delhi High Court, a Division Bench finally put these questions to rest.Before getting to the DB order, let’s first understand what a divisional application is. The Patent Act accommodates filing of a patent application with either provisional or complete specifications under Section 9. Section 7(1) states that ordinarily, each application should relate to a single invention only. In the event where an application contains more than one invention a divisional application under Section 16 can be filed for an invention disclosed in the provisional or complete specification of a previously filed parent application. The idea behind Section 16 is to offer flexibility to patent applicants when their initial application encompasses multiple inventions. Controversy around divisional application arose when a Single Judge bench in Syngenta Ltd. v. Controller of Patents (2023), differed with the findings of a coordinate bench in Boehringer Ingelheim v. Controller of Patents (2022) on the necessity of having multiple inventions in the parent application (plurality) in order to file a divisional application, and whether the location of its disclosures in provisional applications is sufficient. The Single Judge referred these questions to the Division Bench (DB). In October 2023, the DB, interpreting Section 16, clarified that a plurality of inventions in the parent application is indeed required for divisional applications, and that these inventions can be disclosed in either the provisional or complete specification of the parent application. In the present post we shall look at how divisional applications have been assessed previously, the different interpretations of the three orders and the implication of the DB order for the pharmaceutical sector.Setting the Criteria for Divisional Applications: Boehringer Ingelheim v. Controller of Patents: Section 16 and the concerned rules on divisional applications have been previously discussed by the Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) in LG Electronics v. Controller of Patents order that held that voluntary / suo moto divisional applications must pertain to a “distinct invention” clarifying that the claims of the parent application and claims of divisional application should be different under Section 16 (3). Later, in ESCO Corporation v. Controller of Patent and Designs the IPAB specified that divisional application should solely stem from the claims of the parent application, emphasizing the principle of “what is not claimed is disclaimed” i.e. to obtain a patent on something described in the specifications, it must be specified in the claims (see Tony Mon George the Regents of the University of Michigan v. Controller of Patents and Designs (OA/48/2020/PT/DEL).Later in the Boehringer Ingelheim case, the applicant submitted a PCT national phase application with 18 separate claims. Over the course of prosecution, these claims were amended thrice, from ‘use claims’ involving a specific inhibitor, to broader ‘product claims’ incorporating combinations featuring the same inhibitor. These amendments were rejected by the Controller under Section 59, arguing that the amendments were beyond the scope of the original claims, primarily basing the rejection on the inhibitor’s use rather than its product-related applications.The applicant sought a divisional application on the rejected amendments. This application was then objected by the Controller on grounds that the claims had already been examined and refused in the parent application. An appeal was filed against thie order. The High Court, building on the ESCO interpretation and the principle of “what is not claimed is disclaimed,” concluded that the absence of ‘product claims’ in the parent application precluded the applicant from pursuing a divisional application with these separate/additional claims. For a detailed discussion on this ruling and its veracity, readers can refer to Amit’s comprehensive two-part post here and here.Challenging Boehringer Ingelheim: Revisiting Divisional Patent Application CriteriaA coordinate bench of J. Hari Shankar in Syngenta v. Controller disagreed with the Court’s interpretation in the Boehringer Ingelheim order. The case arose when Syngenta’s divisional application, based on a patent application for an “Agrochemical concentrate with adjuvant and hydrotrope,” was rejected by the Indian Patent Office. Though not specifically cited in the Controller’s rejection order, the Court noted during arguments that the rejection was aligned with the Boehringer Ingelheim case’s position. Discussing the Boehringer Ingelheim order, the Court expressed reservations on its finding on the following grounds:Based on this analysis and his apprehension on the Boehringer case, the single judge referred two questions for consideration to a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court: Division Bench clarifies Comma Controversy on Divisional Patent Application:Examining Section 16, the Court focused on the maintainability of a divisional application independent of the outcome of the parent application. The Court held that the placement of comma in the text of Section 16(1) is not as critical as stated in the Single Judge order. Instead, the Court clarified that, the requirement of disclosing the plurality of invention in provisional or complete specification of the parent application, is a must regardless of whether the divisional application is filed voluntarily (suo moto) or in response to an objection by the Controller. Thus, stating that the only restriction here is regarding non-duplication of claims between the parent and divisional application under Section 16(3). Fleshing out the legislative intent of Section 16 through Clause 05.02.02 of the Manual of Patent Office Practice and Procedure, it was observed that Section 16(1) permits plurality of inventions to be disclosed within either the provisional or complete specification. Further aligning this with Article 4G of the Paris Convention, the Court acknowledged the right to file divisional applications both suo-moto and objection-based, as long as the parent application discloses plurality of inventions.However, the Court’s response to the second question seems controversial. The bench analyzed Boehringer Ingelheim and concluded that the single judge wrongfully relied on the “what’s not claimed is disclaimed” principle to set the limitation on disclosure of the invention in divisional filings and asserted that the principle is relevant only for infringement analysis and not for divisional applications and claim drafting. Doing so, the Court read Section 16(1) literally and held that divisional applications can be filed for inventions which are disclosed not only in the complete specification but also in the provisional specification of the parent application. For its reasoning on the “What’s not claimed, is disclaimed” finding, the DB relied on the House of Lords’ finding in Electric and Musical Industries Ltd. et al vs. Lissen Ltd, a position taken in 1939 when India didn’t have an independent patent regime in place, and effectively overlooked the practice of the Indian Patent Office (see para. 05.03.15) and other notable resources where the importance of this principle in delineating the scope of the invention has been reiterated (for instance see here (pdf) and here at pg. 182). Examining the Impact: How Flexibility in Divisional Patent Applications Could Shape Access to Medicines:The DB order has thus expanded the scope for filing divisional application and a probable offshoot of this interpretation is that applicants may strategically file multiple divisional applications for inventions to form a thicket of sorts over the invention. Also, whether the above interpretation will enable the applicant to file divisional application over inventions which have been refused earlier? Asking this question is important because a divisional application can be filed “at any time before the grant of the patent” and not till the parent application has been “disposed of”.One sector that this order is bound to have a massive impact on is the pharmaceutical sector where strategic filings of divisional application on the basis of overbroad disclosures can eventually impinge the entry of generic and biosimilar medicines in the market. As highlighted by Katarina Foss-Solbrekk in their paper, often divisional applications are not only about getting grants but are also about resetting the deadline clock to come up with answers to objections and also to demotivate generics. They substantiated this argument by citing the Abbvie-Humira EP1406656 divisional applications where after being opposed by 15 companies, Abbvie eventually withdrew its application but in the meantime had filed many second generation divisional applications (divisional applications stemming from an earlier divisional application). One of the reasons one of the cited aggravating factors to make matters worse is the slow opposition procedure at the European Patent Office (EPO). The average time since the first office action and the final decision of the EPO is 24.3 months. In comparison to this, India has an average pendency time to dispose of an application of 51 months.All in all, with this broad interpretation by the Court, a meticulous assessment of divisional applications is now warranted by the Indian Patent Office. These can be in the form of undertaking rigorous checks against double patenting. However, the abnormally high number of patent grants and celebration thereof, somewhat makes one apprehensive whether this will be seen as a problem by the patent office in the first place. "

We are pleased to announce that Third World Network (TWN) is organizing a one-hour discussion (with Q&A) on “How Patent Monopolies on Biologics and Vaccines Work” on November 22. The discussion will focus on the first chapter of the recent TWN and AccessIBSA paper- ‘Monopolies on Biologics, including Vaccines’.Makemytrip India Private Limited vs Dialmytrip Tech Private Limited on 21 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court passed an interim injunction restraining the defendants from using the mark “Dailmytrip” for tour, travel and hospitality services, holding it to be deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s “Make my trip” marks. Emerald Enterprises vs Emerald Valves Private Limited on 21 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court passed an ex-parte at interim injunction order restraining the defendants from using the mark “Emerald” for valves holding it to be deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s registered “Emerald” mark. Though the defendant’s mark was also registered, the court reiterated that the prior use of the mark has to be protected and the registration will not have any bearing.Universal City Studios Llc. & Ors. vs Fztvseries.Mobi & Ors on 21 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court passed a “Dynamic +” injunction restraining 44 defendants and their mirror websites from exhibiting the plaintiff’s works, including the future works. The court directed the Dept. of Telecommunications and MeitY to issue blocking orders against the websites. Muneer Ahmad vs Registrar Of Trade Marks on 17 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court set aside the impugned order rejecting the appellant’s application for registration of “Bharat” device mark. The respondent had rejected the application holding that the mark is devoid of distinctive character and is ineligible for registration under Section 9(1)(a) or 9(1)(b). However, the court held that the respondent did not consider the mark as whole and merely considered individual parts of the mark and thus set aside the impugned order. Ms Sk Educations Pvt Ltd vs Sripati Bhushan Srichandan & Anr on 17 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court passed an ad interim injunction against the defendant, restraining them from using “Bachpan” as a word mark or a logo for play schools, holding it to be deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s “Bachpan” mark. The court held that use of “Bachpan” marks by the defendant even after the expiry of the franchise agreement between the parties results in likelihood of confusion and association as envisaged under Section 29(2)(c) r/w Section 29(3). Glaxo Group Limited vs Naresh Kumar Goyal, Trading on 22 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)In this case a rectification petition was filed simultaneously with the suit alleging trademark infringement and the defendant took a defence of registration of the impugned mark in the written submission. Considering section 124, the court clarified that in such a case where rectification and an infringement suit are filed against the impugned mark, the rectification petition has to be decided first, before proceeding with the trial of the suit and listed the rectification for hearing on January 9, 2024. Johnson & Johnson vs Pritamdas Arora T/A M/S Medserve on 22 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff alleged that the defendants are manufacturing counterfeit bleading management devices bearing its marks “‘Ethicon’, ‘Ligaclip’, ‘Surgicel’ and ‘Surgicel’. The plaintiff alleged that the defendants were repackaging expired products and selling them in the market. The defendant stopped appearing since October 7, 2021 and since December 2021, the matter has been proceeded ex-parte followed by issuance of bailable warrants against the defendants. Considering the above, the court shared the passport number, Aadhar no., PAN and GST numbers of the defendants and directed the Delhi Police, Bureau of immigration, UIDAI, GST Dept. IT Dept. to place a fresh status report on the whereabouts of the defendants- Mr. Pritamdas Arora and his wife Ms. Ritika Arora. Sun Pharmaceutical Industries vs Protrition Products Llp & Ors. on 24 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Court held that the defendant’s mark “Abbzorb” is deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s “Abzorb” mark. Though the defendant’s mark was also registered, the court held that the defence of registration of the impugned mark (u/s 30(2)(e)) will not arise in a case where the marks are registered under different classes. Furthermore, the court held that once the defendant was intimidated about the plaintiff’s mark under class 5, in the FER, they should have ensured to not use a deceptively similar mark and since the defendant still chose to use the impugned mark, they should face the consequences. M/S Malhotra Book Depot vs M/S Mbd Industries And Anr. on 22 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The dispute was over the use of the mark “MBD” by the defendants which was alleged to be similar to the plaintiff’s “MBD” mark. The plaintiff engaged in publishing business whereas the defendants engaged in the business of road construction. Over the course of mediation hearings, the parties agreed that the defendant will modify its mark to “JMVD” however, the plaintiff still pressed for damages. The court, considering the different sectors in which the parties operate and repeated adjournments sought by the plaintiff, held that plaintiff cannot have an objection to the defendant’s use of the “JMVD” mark and allowed the defendant to continue using it. Laxmi Kohlu Ghar vs Controller General Of Patents, Designs and Trademarks on 22 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)A writ petition was filed by the plaintiff alleging that reasons for orders passed by the trademarks office accepting or directing advertisement of a mark are not made publicly available. The respondent stated that the reasons are given in an internal note sheet which can be accessed by filing an RTI. However, the court relied on the orders passed in Jai Bhagwan Gupta v. Registrar of Trademarks and Kaira District Cooperative Milk Producers Union Ltd and Another v. Registrar of Trademarks and Others to hold that a brief order must be passed while accepting or rejecting a mark and that cannot be regarded as an internal note sheet. The court further directed that this order should be made available on the online portal of the Registry and in case it is not uploaded, a copy should still be shared upon request by an email. Eicore Technologies Pvt. Ltd. & vs Eexpedise Technologies Pvt. Ltd. on 22 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)In this case the defendant is accused of infringing the plaintiff’s copyright by modifying the source code while servicing the plaintiff’s software. The plaintiff argued that the source code is a part of the software and altering the source code would amount to adaptation of the computer programme within the meaning of Section 14. The defendant sought sometime to respond and the court renotified the matter for December 12. Filo Edtech Inc vs Union Of India & Anr. on 21 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court reiterated that an appeal against an impugned order by a Patent Office will lie before the High Court of the jurisdiction where the application was filed. In doing so, the court resorted to the reasoning of a coordinate bench in Dr. Reddy’s Lab v. Controller of Patents. Scrum Alliance Inc vs Prem Kumar S & Ors. on 21 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court held that the defendant’s certification trademark is deceptively similar to the plaintiff’s “Certified Scrum Master” certification mark and passed an ex-parte ad interim injunction order restraining the defendant from using the impugned mark. The court compared the two marks and held that the marks are nearly identical. On the defendant’s argument that there is no likelihood of confusion, the court held that confusion has to be assessed from the perspective of a person who is familiar with the plaintiff’s certification mark. The court further held that the possibility of confusion is further exacerbated by defendant’s use of a similar sun motif. Google Llc vs Makemytrip (India) Private Ltd. on 23 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)A division bench of the Delhi High Court will consider the question of whether an identical use of a mark as a keyword will attract the presumption of confusion u/s 29(3). The next date of hearing is December 12, 2023. Google Llc vs The Controller Of Patents on 22 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)An appeal was filed against the impugned order rejecting the appellant’s patent application on the ground of lack of novelty and inventive step. The appellant argued that in the impugned order, the respondent has only considered teachings of one prior art and there are two main features of the invention which are not disclosed in the prior art. Earlier the court had directed the concerned official from the respondent’s office to appear before it. However, no one appeared on the concerned date and thus, the court listed the matter on December 13, 2023 directing the concerned officer to appear and explain how the application is hit by objections of novelty and inventive step. Aero Club vs M/S Sahara Belts on 22 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court passed a summary judgement, decreeing the suit in favor of the plaintiff. The plaintiff alleged infringement of its “Woodland” trademark by the defendant. The court had earlier granted an ex-parte interim injunction and directed for execution of a local commission. Considering the report of the local commissioner and the plaintiff’s arguments, the court held that the defendant is selling counterfeit products and accordingly imposed damages worth INR 10 lakhs along with INR 1 Lakh as costs on them. Apollo Hospitals Enterprises Ltd. v. Dr. Dheeraj Saurabh on November 20, 2023 (Madras High Court)In a trademark infringement suit filed against the defendant’s use of “New Apollo” mark, the Madras High Court recognized “Apollo” as a well known trademark. The court also analyzed Section 11(6), Section 2(1)(zg) and provisions of the Trademark Rules, to clarify that the power to recognize a mark as “well-known” are concurrently vested with the Registrar and the Court.

    "data": "In December, 2022 Gaurangi wrote about a rather interesting case (Ab Mauri India Private Limited vs Vicky Aggarwal & Ors.) wherein the Delhi High Court had initiated a criminal contempt proceeding against the defendants for producing a fake IPAB order and placed the matter before the Chief Justice for reference to the appropriate division bench. Bringing the matter to a seeming end, a division bench comprising of Justice Suresh Kumar Kait and Justice Shalinder Kaur has now directed the Bar Council of India to take appropriate actions against the party’s advocate, if found guilty of “manufacturing the order” purported earlier to be that of IPAB.Though the contempt proceedings were initiated against the defendants, the DB discharged them considering their unconditional apology stating that the contempt was not deliberate and it was because of the copy of the fake order provided to them by their advocate. In fact, in the apology, the defendant stated that they have lodged a complaint against their advocate before the Bar Council of India. The defendant explained that they had been engaging the services of the advocate’s firm since 2008 and in 2015 they were informed by the advocate that a petition has been filed before the IPAB. The defendant further submitted that over the course of time, against the 2015 matter, they had been making payments to the advocate and eventually in April 2016 the advocate handed them a copy of the order dated March 02, 2016, purported to be passed by the IPAB.Though the defendant submitted that owing to their association with the advocate since 2008 they did not suspect them to be capable of this misdeed, cross-checking the veracity of the order when the matter first came to light (in 2022) would have been prudent. Oh but how could they have checked that, considering there is no official and openly accessible repository of the IPAB orders after the takedown of the Board’s website. I tried looking for this order in our openly accessible repository of IPAB orders but was not able to find a copy. Then I tried accessing the defunct IPAB website using the Wayback Machine where the list of orders for March, 2016 does not show any orders passed on March 02, 2016. This is not the first time that an IP law practitioner has had to face the music for their misconduct/ negligence. Earlier Prashant, Aparajita, Lokesh and I have separately written about instances where the courts have called out the patent agents for their actions. However, unlike in those cases, where there is no disciplinary mechanism against the misconduct of a patent agent, if found guilty of professional misconduct by the disciplinary committee, suitable actions can be taken under the Advocates Act. It has been previously enunciated in Smt. Lachi Tewari & Ors. v. Director of Land Records, and The Secretary, Department of Horticulture, Chandigarh v. Raghu Raj that a party cannot be held responsible for errors committed on behalf of their counsels and though the court has not expressly recognized this principle, the outcome seems to be accurate nonetheless. Another important issue highlighted in this controversy is the absence of a publically available official source wherefrom orders of the IPAB can be easily accessed. As discussed by Gaurangi in her post (linked above) earlier when the IPAB’s website was still functioning anyone could have accessed it for a copy of an order passed by the board (and could also have checked in case the order was fake). However, after the website’s takedown, such orders are available mostly on paid databases. With this controversy now laid to rest, hopefully, the concerned authority will understand the problem with scrapping a database of judicial orders overnight and will install some backup mechanisms to enable public access to these orders."

Views expressed here are those of the author’s alone.]The Ministry of I&B, on Nov. 3, released a notification notifying nodal officers under Sec. 7(1B)(ii) Cinematograph Act, 1953, for issuing notifications to intermediaries to disable access to infringing content found in contravention of Sec. 6AB (view notification here). I have previously dealt with this notice and issues arising from it here. In this post, I wish to explore the constitutionality of the institutional mechanism which the notification seeks to establish. I will first discuss the background of Cinematograph Act, considering the recent amendments. I will argue that the institutional mechanism of nodal officers imposes unreasonable restrictions on Art. 19(1)(a), falls foul of ‘due process’ requirements under Art. 21 and fails the test of proportionality in restricting free speech. The Cinematograph Act (here) was enacted in the year 1952. In its own words, it was enacted ‘to make provision for the certification of cinematograph films, for exhibition and for regulating exhibitions by means of cinematographs.’ That is to say, the Act was only supposed to regulate the certification of cinematograph films for public exhibition. Arguably, regulating exhibitions by means of cinematographs could also include measures against film piracy. However, historically, the Act had no provisions to put in place any mechanism of sorts to deal with infringing copies of film being exhibited or distributed. It was only in 2023 that the Parliament enacted the Cinematograph (Amendment) Act, 2023 (here) which inserted Sec. 6AA and 6AB to the original Act. Simply put, these sections read with Sec. 7(1B)(ii) empowered the ‘appropriate government’ to take ‘suitable action against any intermediary’ found exhibiting or distributing an infringing copy or abetting the said activity. Apart from the newly inserted sections, the whole scheme of the Act does not talk about copyright infringement or film piracy. The questions which then arise: why was the amendment made? What is the redressal mechanism envisaged? How different is it from the mechanism under Copyright Act? Does the institutional mechanism, in its present form, meet minimal connotational safeguards?In the next section, we will answer these questions while discussing the constitutionality of the newly introduced ‘institutional mechanism of nodal officers’. Goonda Act state legislations, originally, were enacted with the objective of curtailing the criminal activities of ‘goondas’ with provisions for removal as well as preventive detention(see here). However, later, through state amendments, the ambit of the Act was widened to include copyright infringement, film piracy and digital offenders. Nehaa has previously argued on the blog here (also look here for a paper by Prashant and Sai Vinod) that such amendments were unconstitutional due to legislative incompetence since the subject of “video or audio pirates” or “digital offenders” fell under the Central List. In the present case, the issue of legislative incompetence does not arise since the amendment was been made in a Central legislation by the Parliament under Entry 39 and 49 of List I. However, the amendment Act falls afoul of the substantive provisions of the Constitution. First, the notification violates the ‘freedom of speech and expression’ enshrined under Article 19(1)(a). Any restriction of rights under 19(1)(a) must be a ‘reasonable restriction’ for Article 19(2). The notification appoints twelve nodal officers, who, upon “receiving complaint from original copyright holder regarding exhibition of pirated/infringing copies of films on the internet, will notify intermediaries to disable access to such link.” If the intermediary does not comply with the request, it will risk losing ‘safe harbour protection’ under Sec. 79(3)(b) of IT Act, 2000. “Safe harbour” is a legal immunity that is designed to presumptively protect intermediaries from being subjected to legal proceedings in respect of content hosted upon their platforms (argued by Petitioners in IT rules 2021 Challenge case (see here for the writ petition sourced from Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy) The provision insulates intermediaries from legal proceedings against content uploaded online, which, in turn, ensures that such intermediaries do not pre-censor online content thus protecting free speech rights. It is safe to assume that “nodal officers” are included within “actual knowledge” under Sec. 79(3)(b)(here). I have argued here that such officers are not legally competent to judicially determine whether infringement of copyright has occurred. I’ve also pointed out that they are not required to hold any hearing in reaching a decision and not required to ask for proof of ownership of copyright. The intermediary must comply with the notification of such nodal officer or else risk legal proceedings and opening itself to legal liability. The trigger-point of coercion – and the chilling effect – takes place at the point at which safe harbour is lost and the Intermediary is opened up to legal liability( see here for the writ petition). The prospect of losing ‘safe harbour’ as a result of a process which is non-judicial, does not require application of mind to individual case and violates the tenet of natural law (audi alteram partem) does not constitute ‘reasonable restriction’ under Art. 19(2). Rather, it confers such officers with wide, arbitrary, and overbroad powers in restricting free speech.Second, the institutional mechanism envisaged does not guarantee ‘due process of law’ under Art. 21. As highlighted, the question of whether copyright is infringed is entrusted with nodal officers who are non-judicial officers, bureaucrats, and regional officers. An officer has wide discretion whether to conduct a hearing before issuing notification, which raises concerns of blocking/ taking down websites based on externally or politically motivated complaints without having to prove either copyright or basis of complaint (here). There is no requirement for making public, such notification of blocking, which raise further accountability and transparency concerns, tying into the existing violation of natural justice principles. This will reverse the gains made in John Doe legal regime. Under the Copyright Act, a copyright owner alleging infringement u/s. 51 can approach the court seeking John Doe blocking orders (see here for Kashish’s post on this) against unknown defendants streaming pirated content. An implicit safeguard against sweeping blocking order in such cases however, is explicit checking and verification of affidavit for each claimed illegality. Moreover, further observations by Justice Gautam Patel such as requirement of giving reasons for blocking, 3-step verification process, etc. (previously discussed here and here) provided key structural safeguards in the existing regime. In the present mechanism, the studios have been given a simpler alternative wherein it has to only inform the nodal officers, who, in turn, will require the take down the content without any hearing or publication of order. Therefore, the present mechanism eviscerates the existing safeguards. In addition, imposing penalties is left to a non-judicial officer, who, in turn, has no guideline to determine the quantum of fine or period of sentence (here). Therefore, the procedure established by the notification is unreasonable, arbitrary and unjust and violates ‘dure process’ guarantee under Art. 21Third, the notification fails the test of proportionality. Per the Puttaswamy (copy taken from SC Observer), test of proportionality ensures that the nature and quality of the encroachment on the right is not disproportionate to the purpose of the law (see here for Prof. Aparna Chandra’s take on this). As highlighted in Prof. Chandra’s paper above, the proportionality test has four prongs: a) Legitimate aim; b) suitability; c) necessity; and d) balancing. Let’s examine how it fares on these prongs: The aim of notification was to ‘curb the menace of film piracy’ which is laudable (and legitimate). On Suitability, the notification entrusts non-judicial officers to determine which content is infringing copyright without any requirement to conduct a hearing on the matter. In this manner, the notification does not advance the aim of the law in any substantial manner. On necessity, the current law does not mandate hearing and risks sentencing up to three years for the offence of copyright infringement. Moreover, no guidelines are provided to determine the quantum of fine or period of sentence. On the other hand, the Copyright Act already provides strict due process protection to intermediaries and content uploader with ‘notice and takedown’ procedure and ‘safe harbour’ provisions (here). Additionally, only judicial officers are tasked with determining copyright infringement and imposing penalties. So, what is the need for a separate procedure?On Balancing, the law fails to achieve the aims in a substantial manner and makes deep inroads into the right to free speech and expression. The notification, in a bid to deter film piracy, seeks to circumvent copyright Act, due process protections and impose ‘blunt and disproportionate’ penalties. The institutional mechanism, as shown above, does not stand against a constitutional scrutiny. Certainly, there are questions remaining as to how the piracy can be curbed. But such an endeavour ideally should require further nuanced thought be put into policy solutions and parameters within which issues of piracy can be effectively tackled while ensuring constitutional guarantees and ‘safe harbour’ provisions remain untouched."

    "data": "We are pleased to announce that registration for the free Certificate Course in Application of Intellectual Property Rights for Startups and Entrepreneurship is currently open. The course is supported by Texas A&M University School of Law and will be delivered in-person at the Centre for Technology and Law, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar on November 22 and 23. The instructors for the course are Prof. Srividhya Ragavan and Swaraj Paul Barooah. For further details please see their call for participation below. According to the Economic Survey Report 2022-23, start-ups in India, as recognised by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), have risen from a mere 452 in 2016 to an impressive 84,012 in 2022, a staggering 18,587% jump in a short span of 6 years! This exponential growth in entrepreneurial activities in India is being led by tech-based start-ups. As per a NASSCOM report, India added a whopping over 1,300 active tech start-ups in the year 2022, taking the total tally of such start-ups to approx. 26,000, accounting for 31% of the overall start-up ecosystem in India! This ever-rising rate of entrepreneurship in India is being fuelled by her gigantic population of 1.43 billion people, accounting for 17.76% of world’s overall human population, second to none in terms of quantum of human resources. India’s youthful population, which has a median age of 28.2 years, one of the lowest in the world, offers her a rare advantage of a demographic dividend, boosted by an unprecedented bulge in her working age population.Here lies the role and significance of start-ups in India, attested by the fact that in the year 2022 alone, the 84,012 start-ups recognised by DPIIT have created 9+ lakh jobs with an increase of 64% over last year! Entrepreneurs – technologically armed, legally aware, financially shrewd, managerially efficient, and enthused with a patriotic zeal to create dignified jobs for a rising India – can make a big impact on the Indian economy. The digital age in which we live has unleashed a new band of entrepreneurs who leverage technology and know-how of fundamental and computer sciences to generate novel and disruptive entrepreneurial ideas. These “techno-entrepreneurs” are not just building new enterprises with exponentially rising revenues but also creating employment opportunities for millions. At the core of these tech-start-ups lie entrepreneurial ideas that are deeply rooted in advancements in science and technology. Intellectual Property Rights (“IPR”) law empowers such techno-entrepreneurs to protect their ideas and inventions from misappropriation and encroachment by others, and thereby, enables them to unlock the true potential value of their intellectual property.Intellectual properties are the manifestation of digital revolution that fuels 21st century technologically-driven economies. These are intangible creations of human mind that promise a stable stream of revenue to their creators. These intellectual properties are “assets” that have a measurable economic value in terms of their intrinsic worth and are capable of commercial exploitation. As owners of their intellect, inventors of intellectual properties have a natural right to exclusively commercialise the products of their minds. This liberty to benefit from one’s intellectual creation gives rise to a bundle of rights related to intellectual property, including, Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, Geographical Indications, among others.The 21st century India relies on inventions, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of the human mind to create employment for her burgeoning youth population and IPR law ensures that the goal is gainfully achieved. Studying IPR law empowers Entrepreneurs to protect and promote their innovation, invention and creations. Understanding IPR law enables “legally aware entrepreneurs/techno-entrepreneurs” to navigate these complex transactions and negotiate favourably. Neglect of IPR law can lead to unintentional infringement, resulting in costly legal disputes. Nevertheless, awareness about dispute settlement strategies can minimise the economic and legal costs of ignoring IPR law.Designed primarily to cater to the entrepreneurial zeal of engineering and management students, this one and a half-day program provides an invaluable foundation in the principles, practices, and significance of IPR to entrepreneurship and start-up enthusiasts. Participants will delve into the significance of IPR for entrepreneurship, exploring the various forms of IPRs that are relevant for entrepreneurial ventures, while gaining practical insights into the strategies, processes, and legal aspects that underpin Patent, Copyright and Trademark protection and enforcement. The course is being supported by Texas A&M University School of Law.The participants of the course can expect the following learning outcomes at the conclusion of the course:The course will be delivered in-person at the Centre for Technology and Law, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, on November 22 and 23, 2023.

Clarification on Divisional Applications SpicyIP Tidbit: Advocate Faces Music for Concocting a Fake IPAB Order!",
    "data": "[This post is co-authored with Tejaswini Kaushal with inputs from Swaraj and an anonymous reader. Tejaswini is a 3rd-year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow. She is keenly interested in Intellectual Property Law, Technology Law, and Corporate Law].The ongoing copyright dispute between Hulm Entertainment (plaintiff) and Fantasy Sports (defendant), currently awaiting adjudication before the Delhi High Court throws open interesting questions on the copyrightability of nascent concepts like GUI and seeking protection on mobile apps through concept notes. And the court’s hopscotch of granting, vacating and then reinstating the earlier modified interim injunction by the Delhi High Court only makes the case more interesting. Hulm Entertainment alleged Fantasy Sports had substantially copied its ‘original trading and stock features’ along with the graphical user interface (GUI) of their fantasy sports mobile application “Exchange22”. This app, as they claimed, is unique in that it combines a stock market trading feature alongside fantasy gaming, something that they said was non-existent in the market prior to its app. Hulm asserted ownership of copyright on the app on the basis of a copyright registration of a literary concept note detailing the working of its app, arguing that the app is an adaptation of the literary concept note. Surprisingly, this was sufficient for the Single Bench (SB) to grant an ex-parte interim injunction (pdf), which they did on April 13, 2022. However, this order was later modified on April 25 (pdf), where Fantasy Sports was restrained from using Hulm Entertainment’s copyrighted works through their “MyFab11” app but allowed their app to be downloaded. With the above order in place, Fantasy Sports later approached the SB with evidence of other similar apps on the market from other third parties, alleging suppression of material facts. Despite SC orders (for eg here) that courts should be extremely cautious while granting ex-parte interim injunctions, it appears that the original injunction was granted without asking for any evidence to show it is unique in the market, or without even specifying what exactly the claimed copyright in the GUI covers! About 1.5 years after the initial injunction, the SB proceeded to vacate this interim injunction on October 17 2023, and also undertook a detailed discussion on the question of copyrightability of GUIs. In this discussion (paras: 40 and 41) they note the lack of specification of what exactly in the GUI the copyright supposedly exists, as well as that the merger doctrine limits the ways in which this combination of fantasy sports leagues and stock market features can be applied, reducing the scope of infringement here. The matter found itself back in court, before the Division Bench (DB), in less than a month though. With the DB holding that the question of whether there was any suppression of material facts, to determine the degree of commonality between the features of the competing apps require further examination. Consequently, the DB has now stayed the SB order to examine the above issues and reimposed the modified interim injunction order of April 25. In doing so, unfortunately, the DB has seemingly missed out on considering some of the crucial aspects of the SB order, especially with regard to its findings on the originality of Hulm Entertainment’s concept note and the copyrightability of GUIs. Though registration is not mandatory to seek protection under Copyright law, Hulm Entertainment raised an argument that its app was an adaptation of its registered literary work- i.e. the concept note and thus should be protected against the alleged infringement by Fantasy Sports. But it did not hold water before the SB on two grounds- first, relying on Fantasy Sports’ arguments that fantasy league apps with stock trading features existed prior to Hulm Entertainment’s app, the SB held the concept note cannot be regarded as novel; and second, by stating that Hulm Entertainment has not pleaded how the concept note has been substantially copied by Fantasy Sports. While the court’s finding on the second ground alone would have sufficed, the first ground is especially interesting because the originality of the concept note was eventually determined on the basis of the originality of its derivative work i.e. Hulm Entertainment’s app. Looking at the practice and procedure manual of the Copyright Office, a concept note will be protected when it has been expressed definitively and flagged with adequate details. Similarly, in Anil Gupta vs. Kunal Dasgupta, the need for explaining a concept with elaborate details has been asserted by the court. But in the present case, the court did not consider whether the concept was sufficiently elaborated upon or not in the concept note but rather held the note to be unoriginal on the basis of the similarity of Hulm Entertainment’s app i.e. its adapted work, with other apps. This raises a question on how did the court determine the originality of Hulm Entertainment’s app in the first place. The court reiterated that originality is the linchpin for copyright protection, meaning work must originate from the author to be eligible for safeguarding (discussed here, here, and here) and asserted that eventually the expression of the ideas is protected and not the ideas themselves. Apart from this, the court held that :- (i) copyright infringement hinges on the substantial similarity between competing works. This criterion was primarily established in the EBC v. Modak case., and its rationale lies in avoiding lawsuits for trivialities (discussed in detail here). (ii) the similarity assessment should be based on the perspective of an average reasonable reader or spectator rather than hypercritical scrutiny (reiterated across various judgments like here and here).(iii) the similarity between competing works does not necessarily indicate copyright infringement if it arises from a shared subject or source (a nuanced discussion on this has been undertaken here).For the court’s assessment, ultimately, the crux of the reasoning lay in the question of originality as established by University of London Press Limited v. University Tutorial Press Limited. The court pointed out that although novelty is not the key criterion for copyright protection, sufficient proof for establishing originality was lacking in Hulm Entertainment’s trading market feature since similar apps existed before theirs. The SB understood a GUI to be comprised of three components on which copyright can be claimed- a computer program that enables functionality and appearance (section 2(ffc)), the artistic/ graphic elements (section 2(o)), and text i.e. the literary work visible to the users (section 2(c)). After this division, it assessed Hulm Entertainment’s submissions (claiming copyrightability in GUI based on Whelan Associates, Inc. v. Jaslow Dental Laboratory and the Bombay High Court order in Maraekat Infotech Ltd v. Naylesh Kothari) and held that no specific pleadings have been made by them with regard to copyright in any of these individual components. The SB then assessed whether Hulm Entertainment’s GUI can be protected as a work in itself. For this it compared the competing GUIs and held that prima facie Fantasy Sports have not substantially copied Hulm Entertainment’s GUI and while there are similarities between the two GUIs they were regarded to be insignificant.Going a step further, the SB relied on the doctrine of merger to assess whether copyright can be claimed on the app. The doctrine states that when there are a limited number of ways to express an idea then copyright cannot be claimed on such expressions as doing so will essentially lead to monopolising the idea itself (see here, here and here). The court assessed the screenshots of the other similar apps and held that for a fantasy sports app there are some commonalities that are bound to exist and thus applying the doctrine of merger, the court held that commonality between the rival applications in the present case cannot be regarded as an infringement. Interestingly, the court did not expressly rule on the question of can copyright be claimed over a GUI as a whole and rather simply referred to the US case Apple Tech v. Microsoft without making any express finding in this regard. In the Apple case the court adopted a similar approach like Computer Associates International v. Altai, Inc where a narrower ‘abstraction-filtration-comparison’ test was adopted for GUIs which required elements to be abstracted from the idea and filtered to exclude components based on external factors, efficiency, or public domain origins before comparing the residual elements for infringement. Just like the Altai ruling the court in the Apple case filtered out non-copyrightable elements and refused to protect the “patent like protection for an idea” of a GUI.Protection of GUIs have often been discussed in the context of Designs and a Calcutta High Court judgement in Ust Global (Singapore) Pte Ltd v. The Controller Of Patents (discussed here), has held GUIs to be eligible for registration under section 2(a) and (d) of the Designs Act, 2000 for protection. However, the current case discusses the protection of GUIs under the Copyright Act. Previously such an assessment was made by the Bombay High Court in Maraekat Infotech Ltd v. Naylesh Kothari, which apparently supported extending copyright protection over GUIs, commenting that “literal similarity, similarity in program structure and design features” needed to be taken into account. This is in line with the understanding mentioned on the website of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) which states that the ‘look and feel’ of a GUI is protectable under the Copyright Act, 1957. This seems to be in contrast to the practice of the EU as held in Bezpečnostní softwarová asociace v. Ministerstvo kultury where the court clarified that copyright does not extend to the visual aspects of a GUI. The present case takes the discussion further and by imposing the additional threshold of the doctrine of merger in the context of the GUIs for fantasy sports, the court seemingly attempted to safeguard the interests of legitimate users. In the SB order, the court reiterated that protection can only be sought for the expression of an idea and not the idea of having a fantasy league game with elements of the stock market and its finding on GUI would have furthered the discussion on protecting GUIs under an IP law (discussed here and here). However, the extremely short stay order seems to have put all of this on a standstill. As discussed above, clearly, the DB did not enter into the merits of the order and relied on those submissions that the SB categorically held were missing from the plaint originally when the ex-parte injunction was granted. Furthermore, the SB’s insights into GUIs and emphasis on the need for originality were not given due attention. The matter will next be taken up on December 19, 2023, where we’ll see how the DB proceeds."

Members of the World Health Organisation (WHO) have suggested an instrument (“convention, agreement or other international agreement”) that seeks to provide a framework for state-to-state cooperation and the advancement of a comprehensive plan in order to strengthen global readiness, allowing countries to be more resilient against future pandemics that incorporates all governmental branches and the general public in light of the recent COVID pandemic.The failures during the COVID pandemic were multifaceted, involving inadequate global coordination, underfunded health systems, and challenges in implementing measures effectively. Moreover, the failures of the WTO to serve as a unifying body for a response to the COVID pandemic have been well documented on the blog recently (for eg here). The International Health Regulations (IHR) were not fully utilised due to countries’ reluctance to comply, fear of economic repercussions, and the lack of enforcement mechanisms. Issues such as delayed information sharing, political tensions impacting collaboration, and prioritising national interests over global cooperation contributed to the failure to effectively implement the IHR, hampering a unified response. Therefore, the need for the Pandemic Accord arose due to the lack of comprehensive global response frameworks, urging a collective commitment to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future health crises, thereby filling the gaps in international cooperation and preparedness.The agreement’s main objectives are to improve national, regional, and global capacities, ensure that healthcare is accessible to everyone, and promote readiness for future pandemics. The process includes diplomatic talks between different countries with the goal of creating a major international agreement that ensures improved collaboration and preparedness in the event of any pandemics in the future. It is still unclear if the 194 WHO member nations will be able to reach a consensus on a pandemic accord that would have any real influence, given the difficult and sensitive subjects being discussed. Due to the ongoing slow progress in the negotiations between member countries, uncertainties have been raised regarding the conclusion of the negotiations by the 77th World Health Assembly in May 2024.The negotiations and foundation for the pandemic accord involved countries within the World Health Organisation (WHO). Nations like Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Namibia, and South Africa advocated for specific language such as “Common But Differentiated Responsibility” (CBDR), aiming to address the varying needs and responsibilities of different nations. Additionally, countries like Fiji played a role in these discussions, emphasizing different perspectives on the accord. Up until now, the six nations chosen to spearhead the process—South Africa, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil, Thailand, and Egypt (one from each region)—have used three separate draft documents from the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body Bureau (INB Bureau) as the foundation for the negotiations.On February 1, 2023, the zero draft of the accord was published by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, and negotiations began on March 3, 2023. Countries set out the way forward for continued negotiations on the global accord with meetings in June, September, and October 2023. The negotiation text proposal provided by the Bureau on October 16 will be discussed during the 7th meeting of the INB, which takes place on November 6–10 and December 4–6. It seems that the members want a review of the text prior to even acknowledging it as a text for negotiation in order to maintain their stance that the proposal for negotiation text would be without prejudice to the right of any member state to present textual proposals and to the status of the compilation document.Evidence of the urgent need to alter the global health security framework is the main area of attention. However, there are still significant differences on crucial issues. Benefit sharing and pathogens are two of them. When disease outbreaks occur, researchers may quickly find microorganisms, which enables the creation of medical countermeasures such as vaccinations as soon as feasible. The main issues regarding equity in pandemic accords revolve around the unequal distribution of resources, access to healthcare, and fair treatment during health emergencies like the COVID pandemic. Concerns have been raised about weakening equity clauses in the latest drafts of pandemic accords, possibly diminishing the focus on ensuring fairness and equal access to healthcare during global health emergencies.Some of the primary elements of the previous draft of the pandemic accord are still included in the most current proposal, including time-bound waivers of intellectual property (IP) rights and advantages for nations that exchange information on hazardous microorganisms. However, during discussions, these two topics have been the main points of disagreement. In order to manufacture pandemic-related goods “during a pandemic,” the draft asks the nations and regional organisations that will be bound by the agreement to commit to agree upon, within the framework of relevant institutions, time-bound waivers of intellectual property rights. Additionally, it encourages patent holders to temporarily waive or manage, as appropriate, payment royalties made by developing country manufacturers. According to the wording, people who have benefited from public financing for the creation of items connected to pandemics would need to comply “as appropriate.”Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical sector is adamantly against an IP waiver, claiming that by discouraging innovation, it would impede future pandemic responses. They have long maintained that the COVID-19 vaccination disparity was caused by trade and export restrictions. Furthermore, major Western countries have adopted a stance on the IP waiver that is somewhat comparable to this. A pandemic agreement with “major limitations” on intellectual property (IP) rights protection, according to German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, “will not fly” for Germany and the majority of its fellow European Union (EU) members, who also asserted that intellectual property security is necessary in order to invest in vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other related fields. Several of the biggest pharmaceutical corporations in the world are based in both Europe and the US, and they oppose significant changes to intellectual property rights under a pandemic accord. Another issue, mostly brought up by European countries, is the relinquishing of executive power to the accord. They argue that it needs to be made very clear that, in the event of a pandemic, all of the signatory nations’ full executive power will not be restricted or infringed upon and that the executive power will always remain within the nations where the action occurs.The WHO Member States are leading an international effort to improve global preparation and equality in responding to pandemics, known as the pandemic preparedness pact. This work is motivated by the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. With an eye towards a comprehensive and inclusive strategy for pandemic preparation and response, the INB was an important contributor in the writing and negotiation of this important agreement. Recent progress has shown that, despite the numerous informal and formal discussions surrounding the pandemic accord, agreement on issues such as the two main points of contention—time-bound waivers of intellectual property (IP) rights and equitable distribution—as well as advantages for nations that exchange information about potentially dangerous pathogens, is still (likely) a long way off.There are huge gaps between high- and low-income nations. High-income countries are reluctant to sign binding obligations to share lifesaving resources. But low-income countries demand that they have a right to fair and affordable access to vaccines and drugs. It is clear that rapid reporting, sharing pathogen samples and genomic sequence data, and sharing scientific and epidemiologic information are vital for global health. It is equally clear that a system where all the benefits go to high-income countries and lower-income countries are left behind cannot be tolerated. The below-stated suggestions are oriented towards addressing equity concerns and ensuring no one is left behind in the way the world deals with major health threats in the future. The recommendations focus on ensuring fair vaccine distribution, healthcare access, and resources, targeting underserved populations. These recommendations have been identified and compiled from various sources. These are as follows:"

    "data": "[This post has been authored by SpicyIP intern Rohan Srivastava. Rohan is a Second Year student at National Law School Of India University and has a keen interest in IPR and Technology Law.]The recent increase in COVID-19 cases in India comes as a Deja Vu, reminiscent of the predicament India and the world were in 2 years ago. While the spike should not be a cause of concern owing to a proper vaccination run (also see here for the number of doses administered), elsewhere, experts and delegates are still engaged in negotiations over a possible extension of the TRIPS waiver to medical supplies and pharmaceuticals products. The TRIPS waiver, which became a hot topic for debates around multilateralism from October 2020, brought to the forefront the international community’s inaction and paralysis in the face of a global crisis of unprecedented scale. The fact that the negotiations recently extended the deadline for deciding on the waiver, almost a year after the medical emergency was subdued, is itself a testament to how time taking and inefficient the waiver fiasco has ended up being. This post will seek to look back at the controversy surrounding the waiver and reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight. In doing so, this post shall uncover the handicaps in seeking the TRIPS waiver, both internally in the WTO decision-making process and problems with the idea of a waiver as a way out of the crisis. This piece will then conclude with certain considerations that must be kept in mind for the future.The Pandemic was not the first time that the WTO’s inefficient decision-making process came to the forefront. (For example- Trade Law enthusiasts will recall the painstakingly long Doha Round of Negotiations, which were the 9th round of negotiations and the first since the WTO was established.) Part of the reason behind the WTO’s inefficient decision-making is its consensus-based model. Consensus, at WTO, means the lack of sustained opposition i.e. a decision is made when no member formally objects to it. (In the context of the TRIPS waiver, the consensus-based decision-making model can be seen in Article IX: 3 (1) of the Marrakesh agreement r/w Footnote 1.)Thus, decision-making at the WTO requires lobbying each and every member of the Organization in support, which often ends up being a zero-sum game for the members. While there is certainly merit in having this consensus-based approach, insofar as it is more democratic and allows due consideration to be given to all viewpoints, the pandemic has clearly exposed that the same rationale may be turned on its head during a medical health emergency. Already, there has been a lot of global north and global south contention over the availability of essential medicines at the time of crisis. For instance, the HIV/AIDS crisis and the surrounding access to medicines issue that started off in 2001 and fructified into an amendment only in 2017 (see here). The same was reflected in the context of TRIPS COVID-19 Vaccine waiver as well, where first a broad waiver was proposed by the member countries (see here and here) and after the subsequently revised proposals (see here), the existing waiver, which applies only on vaccines, was accepted. These instances show how the consensus-based approach at the WTO, which can be argued to protect the interests of the less influential countries, can also work against them when decision-making is required to be made in emergencies where time is of the essence. This is especially significant since the developing countries have for long been in majority in the WTO but still have not had their say, for the self-interests of a handful of developed nations (read here and here). What is even more ironic is that despite the strong resistance by the developed nations in the negotiation process which led to further delays in reaching a conclusive and timely waiver, the ministerial council’s final decision did not even concern the developed nations as they were not eligible members as per the document. What is to be kept in mind is that it was ultimately the developing countries that had to face the brunt of being deprived of their IP Protection. (Find more on this here.) Looking at the October 2020 draft, proponents claimed that a waiver is necessary to ensure proper access because the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS such as compulsory licensing etc. are not feasible in an emergency such as the pandemic. However, proponent countries themselves actively refused from utilising already existing flexibilities first to reach the above assertion. For instance, the Indian Supreme Court even questioned the Indian government’s reluctance to utilise compulsory licensing provisions in domestic law on precisely this point, and yet there was no action on this front. (Read more on this here) The lack of an efficient internal decision-making process at the WTO and wide disagreements over the desirability of a waiver raises the question of whether it is the appropriate recourse at times of crisis or if the global community would do better to envisage alternative mechanisms in the future. The opponents of the waiver, who were mostly the developed nations housing the major pharmaceutical manufacturers, argued that the October 2020 waiver will take away the incentive to innovate the cure for the pandemic. They instead argued that the members should utilize the flexibilities incorporated within the TRIPS in order to cater to the rising need for essential commodities. Even the final ministerial decision was an iteration of the opponent’s sentiment only, in so far as it did not technically waive off any IPR protections under the TRIPS but instead clarified the existing flexibilities. Looking at the TRIPS agreement, one can see that it is cognizant of the need to balance such social imperatives with the protection of IPR, and has incorporated relevant structural features. For instance, Article 7 provides that the ‘protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare’ while Article 8 states that Members ‘may, in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health … provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of the Agreement’. The TRIPS agreement makes it clear that Members are free to pursue legitimate public policy objectives. Furthermore, despite claims to the contrary, TRIPS flexibilities, including mandatory licensure, pharmaceutical transition measures, parallel importation, and research exceptions, have all been used and successfully demonstrated. For instance, a study by Ellen t’Hoen et al on the use of TRIPS flexibilities found that 89 countries used TRIPS flexibilities 176 times between 2001 and 2016, with over half of those uses (79.5%) involving Compulsory license, public noncommercial use, and LDC pharmaceutical transition measure. Thus, one would not be wrong to think that a lot of crucial time wasted in the negotiations at the time of the crisis could have been saved, had the proponents focussed more on aggressively pursuing the existing options or seeking clarification regarding the same for greater certainty, especially given that this was what was eventually agreed to instead of having a blanket waiver. It is undoubtedly true that a global crisis of such a magnitude would require multilateral cooperation and collective initiatives, the question however is what could be achieved by a patent waiver when most LDC countries lack the required infrastructure capabilities to actually engage in vaccine manufacture. Looking at a chart of key vaccine developing countries (here) one can see that there are only a handful of developing countries with vaccine manufacturing prowess. Assuming the broader waiver proposal was accepted, the opponents (housing the majority of vaccine developers) could still have refused to apply the same in their countries, (this intent is evident from the outcome waiver document that expressly exempts the developed countries from the ambit of its application). And thus, the only benefit that would have occurred out of the broad waiver would have been the flexibility to not be sued for non-consensual use of the IP involved in the production of the vaccines, by the manufacturers located in these developing- broad waiver proponent countries. However, it is pertinent to note, that if the ultimate benefit of the waiver would have been the freedom from being sued for non-consensual use of the underlying IP, then as argued above, TRIPS already caters to it under Article 73 (b)(iii), and thus making the whole exercise largely a rut. It is also interesting to note that the developed countries which came to the table in favour of the TRIPS waiver in the name of multilateral cooperation for assuring equitable access to vaccines, were at the same time also doing lip service to their commitments by signing bulky procurement orders with multiple vaccine manufacturers to keep their eggs in several baskets. These orders were also often in excess of the vaccine requirement of the particular country, at a time when vaccine availability across the world was uncertain. The TRIPS negotiation allowed vaccine nationalism to maintain face at the international fora as is also evident from the final ministerial decision which limited the applicability to the developing countries and LDCs. (Refer here) It thus becomes evident that a TRIPS waiver cannot be seen as a ready response that will act as a panacea to the woes of vaccine availability during times of crisis. With regards to the internal process in the WTO, the pandemic has made it clear that WTO cannot be expected to make ad-hoc decisions due to the consensus requirements given that differing considerations, such as the impact on innovation etc. are involved in such a decision. The only hope on the IPR front would be for the WTO to create structural safeguards that can aid in times of such crisis and clarify such flexibilities. Given that the utility of a waiver itself is also under question, the WTO also needs to focus more on ensuring the availability of vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and treatment options by continuing its efforts to identify and reduce barriers to trade, to ensure that states which do not have the institutional capacity to make use of the waiver are not left out. One instance of such a barrier is regulatory bottlenecks which impeded the speedy dispersal of vaccines globally. (Read more on this here and here) In addition to this, there have also been criticisms against the TRIPS framework for being unable to protect the interest of developing nations and encouraging the growth of technology in the LDCs. So far, TRIPS has only ensured greater IP protection to technology-generating countries and there has been no trickle-down or transfer of technology from the higher-income countries to the LDCs, despite having provisions urging the same. It is imperative that WHO, which is better suited for responding to a global health crisis, steps up to the game for ensuring equitable access to vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other medical aid through multilateral cooperation. Much of the international cooperation in such efforts will also depend upon the fate of the global treaty for future pandemic emergencies under the WHO which is currently under negotiations. The main purpose of the initiative is to ensure early detection and prevention of future pandemics, including a stronger international health framework within the WHO that would attempt to ensure universal and equitable access to medical solutions. It is also pertinent to note that the treaty includes provisions for timely waiver of IP protection so that there is no tussle at the time of crisis and valuable time and lives are not wasted (Article 7.4). However, as if the international community refuses to learn, the negotiations are again facing institutional concerns and are being done in a non-transparent manner (See Talha Burki’s statement on this media coverage here). This can potentially undermine trust in the process and history might again repeat itself with another deadlock over the differences between the developed and developing nations and over the fate of countless lives.Multilateral cooperation at times of global emergencies like the pandemic is understandably hard to come by given the pressing needs each member state has internally. The COVID-19 pandemic cannot be seen as a one-off event and it is widely predicted that as man taps more with nature it is likely that there may be a rise in the frequency of pandemics. Thus, it would do well if the international community sees the entire TRIPS waiver fiasco as a lesson on how things pan out practically in times of crisis and is able to come up with more practical and efficient mechanisms which would allow all states to acquire an equitable supply of vaccines despite the socio-economic inequalities across the borders.

Johnson & Johnson’s “Non-Enforcement” of Bedaquiline Patents: What has Actually been Gained? Overview of the S. 3 landscape on patenting biotechnology inventions in India IP Rights, Access, and WHO’s Pandemic Accord",
    "data": "It is critical for the government to be forward-thinking. The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, a government department, is reported to have provided INR 70 to 100 crores to Gennova Pharmaceuticals for its development of an mRNA vaccine for Covid. The mRNA technology is a versatile platform technology that has been heralded as a new era in vaccines. The platform used by Gennova (saRNA – self-amplifying RNA) overcomes storage / temperature issues that affected previous versions of mRNA vaccines. Unlike existing mRNA vaccines that need to be stored at very low temperatures, saRNA vaccines can be freeze-dried and stored at higher temperatures. Lower cost and freeze-drying would solve some major distribution problems.Significant public health benefits lie in the versatility of this platform. While currently used for Covid, trials are underway for its use to treat other diseases such as Zika, Zoster and Rabies. This platform technology has potential for use for several other infectious as well as non-infectious diseases including TB, malaria, dengue and possibly even cancer, auto-immune diseases, and diabetes. Given its versatility, it is not possible for one pharmaceutical company to explore the technology’s wide-ranging applications. True value can be unlocked only through widespread research, proper regulation and use. There is therefore a need to make the technology more accessible.Access to this technology is, however, at risk. The government has blanketly refused to disclose its collaboration agreement with Gennova. Prashant has challenged this refusal before the Delhi High Court. As per precedent decided in Navroz Mody v. Mumbai Port Trust, the government is obligated to disclose public-private partnership agreements.Locking up the collaboration agreement bodes badly for public health efforts. The public, scientists, researchers and other industry players, all of whom can contribute to effective use of this technology, are in the dark about intellectual property rights that surround it. Typically, collaboration agreements contain key details about the invention, scientific and manufacturing processes, intellectual property right ownership, research plans, collaborator rights, resource allocation etc. Therefore, the collaboration agreement may contain material information as to ownership of patents, trade secrets and other technology. And knowledge regarding ownership of intellectual property is the first step towards increasing its access.The government, through this collaboration agreement, may have in its hands very lucrative technological secrets. mRNA vaccines contain three main ingredients – mRNA, the lipids (that encase the mRNA) and sugars / stabilisers. The process of sequencing, making, mixing, purifying and combining each of these ingredients requires expert knowledge. Gennova that developed these mRNA-based vaccines, in collaboration with a US bio-tech company HDT, surely has the required expertise. Many of these processes can also be documented and drug regulatory approvals require their documentation. Through the collaboration agreement the government may also have access to these documents and consequently to the process of making mRNA vaccines. This is no small issue given the vast potential of this technology.While the collaboration agreement should definitely be disclosed, the government may have reason not to disclose trade secrets such as manufacturing processes to make and use the mRNA platform. ‘Trade secrets’ have a specific meaning under law. However, at this point it is unclear whether this information will qualify as trade secrets given the USD 950 million lawsuit against Gennova for trade secrecy theft pending in the US. To defend itself, it is possible that Gennova may argue that these processes do not qualify as ‘trade secrets’. In which case there will be no reason for the government to withhold this information from the public. Further, since the government funded Gennova’s efforts, it is significant for the public to understand the impact of this lawsuit on the government and government funds. All this will be known only if the collaboration agreement is disclosed. Separately, assuming that these are indeed trade secrets, instead of locking them up, the government should establish transparent processes to increase technology transfer. The government can do this by disseminating information to universities or private industries by facilitating technical cooperation. Given that the world at large is interested in the mRNA platform, these efforts will attract investments into India, increase industry uptake and increase innovation around this new technology. Mutually beneficial relationships with industry and researchers can be established through transparent and reasonable licensing agreements that can increase access to this technology. Instead of digging in its heels, the government should disclose the collaboration agreement and should pursue ways to increase access to technologies that can have significant public health benefits."

    "headline": "IP Rights, Access, and WHO’s Pandemic Accord Potential Loopholes in the Execution of Local Commission Rochem v. Nirtech – Analysing the Claim of Breach of Confidential Information An Obituary to the TRIPS ‘Waiver’: Lessons from an Imperfect Response",
    "data": "The Indian government has refused to disclose its collaboration agreements and investments made in developing and procuring India’s Covid 19 vaccine – Covaxin, the Indian mRNA and intranasal vaccine candidates.Despite widespread public interest in these arrangements, the government has consistently rejected Right to Information (RTI) applications requesting this information. (for the responses received from the CIC see here, here and here) Prashant Reddy (who needs no introduction on this blog) filed several RTI requests covering public-private partnership arrangements related to the Covid 19 vaccines. He has challenged the blanket refusal by the government before the Delhi High Court. He is represented by lawyers Swathi Sukumar and Sai Vinod (also a former SpicyIP blogger).Since 2021 the Indian public has been made aware of the existence of several public-private arrangements related to the development and procurement of Covid 19 vaccines. For instance, the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology, two government bodies, collaborated with Bharat Biotech to develop a Covid 19 vaccine – Covaxin. The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) also funded Gennova Pharmaceuticals and Bharat Biotech for their mRNA and intranasal vaccine candidates. Further, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare placed purchase orders for several vaccines.Since then, the Indian public has raised several questions regarding the details of these arrangements. Many articles (e.g. here and here) have questioned the lack of transparency, intellectual property rights concerns, and the lack of information about the amount of taxpayer money that has gone into these arrangements. It is clear that the public, whose money is being used, wants to know the details. More so because a substantial amount of public funds and resources have been expended in this regard. For context, more than 36 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered in India. However, the government has refused to provide information regarding these arrangements.In an attempt to characterise this issue as an intellectual property rights issue (rather than a governance issue), the government has cited an exemption under Section 8(d) of the RTI Act to withhold information. The categories of records exempt under Section 8(d) are ‘commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party.’ To be sure, this is not a blanket exemption. The competent authority can disclose even these categories of information if it is satisfied that ‘larger public interest warrants its disclosure’. Everything else aside, the arrangements in questions are not every day, ordinary arrangements. These arrangements relate to public authorities and a public purpose – developing vaccines to protect against Covid 19. Further, they arose out of and are inherently tied to a world-wide, deadly pandemic, an international health emergency, that the public is undoubtedly interested in. In fact, public disclosure of COVID-19 vaccine agreements is the global norm. The United States and the United Kingdom that collaborated with private companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines have released copies of their research and collaboration agreements under their Freedom of Information (FOI) laws with redactions. This by itself warrants disclosure and the government seems to have mischaracterised the issue at hand.Even otherwise, as argued in detail by Prashant in his petition, public-private agreements are subject to different treatment under the RTI Act. As per binding precedent, the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) is obligated to disclose public-private partnership agreements (Navroz Mody vs. Mumbai Port Trust). Further, government bodies like ICMR and BIRAC are obligated under law (Section 4 of the RTI Act) to publish information relating to public-private partnerships (PPPs) on the internet. In 2013, the Department of Personnel and Training issued guidelines which instructed public authorities to disclose “all information” relating to PPPs voluntarily including documents generated in the course of implementation of the PPPs, all payments made under PPPs along with the purpose of the payments. The government has also argued that since the contracts are on-going they should not be made to disclose them. But the petitioner has cited several cases where high courts have allowed disclosures even where contracts were ongoing or still in operation.As highlighted by the petitioner, instead of a blanket refusal, the concerned authority should have perused the documents in order to establish whether they contain any information relating to ‘trade secrets’ or ‘commercial confidence’ or ‘intellectual property’ – all terms that have specific meaning under law.It seems difficult to beat the law and the logic in the petition. Interestingly, the government seems to be flustered by the petitioner’s strong case and is resorting to cheap tactics – personally attacking him for ‘acting against the interest of the nation’ instead of fighting the matter on its merits."

    "data": "Battle lines are being drawn in the fight over the lucrative mRNA vaccine technology used in certain Covid 19 vaccines. Moderna recently sued Pfizer alleging patent infringement of three out of eight patents that cover its Covid 19 vaccine (Spikevax).Moderna has supplied over 299 million doses of its Covid 19 vaccine to the United States and has, reportedly, lined up supply deals worth USD 35 billion through the end of 2022.Pfizer and BioNTech have supplied over 472 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) for use in the United States. Pfizer recently announced that it expects an additional USD 32 billion in global revenues from Comirnaty.As reported, Moderna earned revenue of around USD 10 billion for its vaccine, and Pfizer earned around USD 22 billion, in just a year. Both companies have enjoyed windfall financial gain from the sale of their respective vaccines. The sales of these vaccines are likely to rank among the highest in a single year for any medical product in history.The sheer size of sales and revenue coupled with patent monopolies and the immense potential of the mRNA technology, makes both these entities King-like – rich, supreme and sometimes hypocritical.The tale of two kingsModernaStrikingly, the portrait that Moderna paints of itself is not one of a King but of a small, research-driven start-up in need of funding. Moderna’s patent infringement lawsuit is a revenue seeking activity since Moderna wants fair compensation but does not want to remove Comirnaty from the market.As claimed, fair compensation will allow it to invest in its leading mRNA platform. Moderna believes that this case will also ensure that next generation biotech startups don’t lose their ability to rely on the patent system.This David v. Goliath narrative is probably drawn up since Moderna has requested a jury trial. Some studies have shown that juries favour independent inventors / start-ups over bigger corporate defendants (e.g. Judge Kimberly Moore, Populism and Patents, NYU L.Rev).Moderna was set up in 2010 with its sole focus being mRNA technology. Moderna claims to be at the forefront of this technology having begun its research before the pandemic and before anyone had figured out how to make or use mRNA medicines successfully. And along the way it encountered several technical challenges which it successfully overcame.Moderna’s Spikevax is covered by eight patents, three of which have allegedly been infringed by Pfizer and BioNTech. The three patents cover novels ways through which Moderna stabilized the mRNA by modifying its chemical structure (to reduce immune response against mRNA itself); identified ways to optimise its mRNA platform; and developed new techniques for manufacturing on a large scale.These efforts include – replacing uridine in the mRNA molecule with 1-methylpseudouridine to reduce immune response against mRNA itself; and discovering that encoding a full-length coronavirus spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation was highly effective at producing neutralizing antibodies to the coronavirus.Due to its focus on mRNA technology and research in this field, once the genomic sequence for SAR-CoV-2 was published, Moderna was able to produce its vaccine at a lightning-fast pace. Moderna had six mRNA candidates for infectious diseases in clinical trials by the time COVID-19 arrived.However, it must be kept in mind that Moderna was able to get the vaccine out so fast because of several other factors. As disclosed by KEI and The Intercept, the US government gave companies special authority to use another person’s technology, without permission, to produce Covid 19 vaccines. Moderna was one such company that was granted a compulsory license. Such relaxations were specifically aimed at speeding up the process of vaccine production. Easy for Moderna to now push for ‘licensing and not abrogating patents’. This issue is the center of controversy in two lawsuits filed against Moderna by Arbutus Biopharma Corp. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. over the use of lipid nanoparticle technology in the mRNA vaccines.Its partnership with the NIH is also alluded to. However, patent ownership controversy with the NIH is a separate story (here and here).Pfizer and BioNTechUnlike Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech started with as many as 20 vaccine candidates representing different mRNA constructs. Moderna claims that not all 20 infringed its patents but ultimately Pfizer and BioNTech decided to go ahead with the one that uses Moderna’s patented technology i.e. uses the same 1-methylpseudouridine chemical modification in a lipid nanoparticle formulation and contains mRNA encoding for the same full-length spike protein for SARS-CoV-2.It appears that BioNTech (another start-up founded by Dr. Sahin and Dr. Tureci) was focused on cancer treatments prior to the pandemic but was also looking into mRNA for cancer treatment.Further, Katalin Karikó whose scientific research has been acknowledged as foundational in RNA mediated immune activation research is associated with BioNTech. Together with Drew Weissman, she holds U.S. patents for the application of non-immunogenic, nucleoside-modified RNA.As reported, these patents have been licensed to both Moderna and BioNTech. BioNTech entered into a partnership with 173 year old Pfizer to commercialise its mRNA technology.Pfize and BioNTech also have patent infringement cases filed against them for their vaccine e.g. by CureVac, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Allele Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals.The world their battlefieldWhile this patent battle is technically being fought in court rooms in Cambridge, MA and Düsseldorf, Germany, it could have worldwide implications.Moderna has pledged (again but this time it appears to be a pledge forever) never to “enforce patents for COVID-19 vaccines against companies manufacturing in or for the 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), provided that the manufactured vaccines are solely for use in the AMC 92 countries.” This pledge becomes relevant for initiatives such as the WHO’s mRNA tech-transfer hub in South Africa. It appears that WHO asked Moderna and Pfizer and BioNTech to help teach researchers in low-and middle-income countries how to make their COVID-19 vaccines. However, neither of the companies responded so the WHO decided to go ahead anyway and replicated Moderna’s vaccine (relying on its older pledge). See here for implications on reneging on pledges in the patent context.Added to this, the fact remains that mRNA vaccine technology is a new era in vaccine science, one with immense potential even beyond Covid 19. Due to its effectiveness, potential for low-cost manufacturing, capacity for speedy development and safe administration, mRNA vaccines have been prophesied to be a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches. The facility to make mRNA can also be used for vaccines for different diseases making manufacturing flexible. See here for a brief overview of the science behind mRNA vaccines.The surest and easiest way for countries and companies to access this technology is to obtain a license from the technology owner. However, as is evident, ownership over this technology and its component parts is extremely fuzzy.When ownership is itself in dispute, the process of obtaining a license from either entity becomes a risky and expensive exercise.Some argue that neither Moderna nor BioNTech-Pfizer nor Curevac and others who are litigating this tech own the technology – it belongs to the world and is in public domain (here). Others argue that some of Moderna’s patent claims are over-broad and may be weakened due to prior art.Given the potential of this technology, it is hoped that this battle gets over sooner rather than later. Some suggest that a simplified inter partes review (before the USPTO rather than courts) is all that it would take which could result in a quick decision. However, given that this is a sport of kings, history shows that when billion-dollar biomedical inventions are involved, disputes drag on in courts for years.Thank you to Swaraj for his inputs!"

India Accelerates in the Patent Race: But Is There a Pot of Gold at the End of the Rainbow?The World IP Indicator 2023 highlights India’s progress in the global patent race. But does this guarantee innovation? In this post, Praharsh highlights some key numbers from the report, along with some general comments on measuring the way forward.Nodal Officers: Unbalancing Expedience and FairnessThe MIB’s system of Nodal Officers to disable the unauthorized exhibition of films is extremely problematic, to say the least. In this very incisive piece, Yogesh highlights the mechanism’s potential to get a blocking order relatively easily and how this system completely bypasses institutional and legal safeguards.Division Bench of Delhi High Court: IP Suits No Longer to Automatically Be Listed Before Commercial CourtsIn a significant (over) ruling, Delhi High Court DB states that all IP suits don’t automatically lie before commercial courts. Swaraj and Praharsh look into this case, pointing out that while the DB may have been right in addressing the artificial distinction that had arisen, the order is unlikely to address the problem that gave birth to the initial order.Johnson & Johnson’s “Non-Enforcement” of Bedaquiline Patents: What has Actually been Gained?Recently Johnson & Johnson announced that it would not enforce its Bedaquiline Patents in 134 low and middle countries. Swaraj and Pranav Aggarwal write on this development questioning whether this means anything different for TB patients.Ayur United Care LLP v. UOI: Where do Appeals from IPAB lie?The Delhi High Court recently clarified that writs challenging orders from the IPAB shall lie before a Single Judge Bench and not a Division Bench of the High Court. Though the order clarifies the state of affairs after the abolition of the IPAB, it somewhat falls short in addressing the anomaly of listing of matters filed before the abolition of the IPAB and matter listed afterwards.

However, after 2+ years of negotiations, not much has progressed. As another round of negotiations starts, Arnav Laroia brings us up to date with the key (contentious) aspects of the accord.Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. vs Mohalla Tech Private Limited on 1 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)In a copyright infringement dispute, the plaintiff sought an interim injunction against the defendant for allegedly continuing to offer its copyrighted recordings on their platforms ShareChat and MojApp post-license expiration. However, it submitted that it would have no objection to the defendant using remix or cover versions of the plaintiff’s copyright content or user generated content. The court passed an ad interim injunction order, restricting the defendant from making the specified works available on its platforms, while permitting the use of cover versions and user-generated content, pending a detailed hearing on 6 February 2024.Ranvir Singh Bijnaria vs M/S Tescon Multi Products Pvt. Ltd. on 3 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court dismissed an appeal against the order of the Trial Court dismissing the suit for want of prosecution. The court observed that after the grant of an ex-parte interim injunction in August 2018, subsequent transfer and reversion of the suit between a non-commerical court and a commercial court, when the matter was taken up in September 2020, the plaintiff’s counsel sought discharge. It further noted that even after subsequent notices when the plaintiff did not appear before the court, the trail judge dismissed the suit. The court held that despite being aware about the proceedings, the plaintiff took no steps to pursue the proceedings and thus find no error in the Trial Court’s judgement.Viridian Development Managers Pvt. Ltd. vs Rps Infrastructure Limited on 6 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff filed the trademark infringement suit aggrieved by the defendant’s use of the mark “World Trade Center”. The parties initially had a business and consulting agreement that permitted usage of the mark and post termination of agreements the defendant continued using the mark. Holding that an ex-licensee cannot be allowed to use the mark after termination of the license, the court also dismissed the defendant’s argument that there was a delay in instituting legal proceedings and thus it will defeat the rights of the plaintiff. It further clarified that there was no inordinate delay in instituting the present suit as after termination of the agreement, the plaintiff tried to amicably resolve the dispute. The court thus passed an interim injunction holding that the continued use of the WTC mark post-agreement termination misleads the public and constitutes infringement.Nilkamal Crates And Contaners & Anr. vs Ms. Reena Rajpal & Anr. on 6 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)In a trademark dispute on the mark “Nilkamal”, Plaintiffs opposed the use of mark “Nilkranti” by the defendant on similar plastic moulds and crate products. The plaintiffs asserted infringement on phonetic similarity over prefix “Nil”. It was observed that monopoly over prefix “Nil” cannot be claimed and latter half of the two marks “Kamal” and “Kranti”, have distinct etymological connotations. While rejecting injunction on trademark, the court observed that the device marks, when compared are deceptively similar owing to them being written in similar blue letters and the encasing of font. Consequently, the defendants were restrained from using their device mark or any similar mark but were allowed to continue using the word mark NILKRANTI, provided it did not infringe on the plaintiffs’ device marks.Telefonaktiebolaget Lm Ericsson vs Intex Technologies (India) Ltd. on 6 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court modified the composition of the confidentiality club constituted and directed to add three advocates on behalf of the defendants as members.Shrinath Travel Agency & Anr. vs Infinity Infoway Pvt Ltd & Ors. on 6 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff filed an interim injunction application against the Defendant no. 3’s use of the “Shreenath” label and Defendant no. 4’s use of ‘Shrinath Tourist Agency” word mark and labels and “Shrinath Nandu Travels” word mark and Defendant no. 5’s use of “Humsafar” label with a similar bus motif. The plaintiff also sought the defendants to be restrained from using the domain names- www.ajayshreenathtravellers.com and http://www.ajayshreenathtravellers.com/ . The court held that the plaintiff’s and the defendant no. 3 and 4’s marks and label are deceptively similar or identical and relying on K.R. Chinna Krishna Chettiar v. Shri Ambal & Co, Midas Hygiene Industries (P) Ltd v. Sudhir Bhatia, the court granted an interim injunction against defendant no. 3 and 4. However, the court refused to pass an interim injunction against defendant no. 5. The court held that the bus motif and use of words “travel and transport agency” cannot be regarded as similar, considering the stark dissimilarity between “Shrinath” and “Humsafar” words. Patanjali Ayurved Ltd vs Meta Platforms Inc & Ors. on 7 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff appealed against the impugned order by the trial court for returning its trademark infringement suit, directing the same to be filed before a non-commercial court. The dispute pertained to alleged infringement and disparagement of Patanjali trademark by the defendant who had uploaded a parody video on Youtube. The court held that the trial court did not follow the mandate under Order VII Rule 10A (1) and the impugned order was passed suo motu without hearing the parties. On the above grounds the appeal was allowed and the court directed the trial court to hear the parties afresh.The Polo/ Lauren Company L.P vs Home Needs on 7 November, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court stayed the District Judge’s order vacating the ex parte interim injunction against the respondent. The ex-parte interim injunction was passed by the District Judge on a finding that the plaintiff’s registered “Ralph Lauren” and “Polo” marks are not similar to the defendant’s registered “Polo Lifetime” mark. However, considering that the appellant’s mark is a well-known mark, cross border reputation of the plaintiff the court passed the present stay order.Mahle Gmbh vs Parag Kirnkumar Tatariya on 9 November, 2023 (Gujarat High Court)A writ petition was filed by the petitioner against the respondent’s registration of the mark “Mahle” for similar products. The petitioner claimed prior registration of the mark and alleged that the respondent’s registration of a similar “Mahle” mark is bound to cause confusion in the course of trade. The petitioner also alleged non use of the impugned mark and thus prayed for rectification of the register. The court exercised its extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 and directed to remove the respondent’s mark from the register on the ground of non use for years from the date of the registration of the mark.L. Prakasam Reddy vs Paras Medical Publishers on 9 November, 2023 (Telangana High Court)A division bench of the Telangana High Court vacated the interim injunction granted by the Commercial Court for not taking “irreparable damages” factor into consideration while passing the impugned order. The respondent has filed the present suit against the appellant’s unilateral termination of the “assignment agreement” regarding the copyright in the latter’s textbook titled “Fundamentals of Medical Physiology” and subsequent agreement with another publishing house to publish the latest editions of the textbook. While the commercial court held that the respondent was able to make out a prima facie case and thus passed the impugned interim injunction order, the High Court held that it failed to consider the “irreparable injury” factor. The court relied on the estimate of damages given by the respondent in the plaint and held that they had failed to establish that an “irreparable injury” would be caused to them if the injunction was not granted and thus set aside the impugned order."

    "data": "[This post is authored by SpicyIP Fellow Yogesh Byadwal. Yogesh is a 3rd year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law School of India University, Bengaluru. He is interested in IP Law, Constitutional Law and Criminal Law. His previous posts can be accessed here].On November 3, 2023, Ministry of Information and Broadcasting issued a notification (see here), establishing an ‘institutional mechanism of Nodal Officers’, under Sec. 7(1B)(ii) Cinematograph Act, 1953, for issuing notifications to intermediaries to disable access to content found in contravention of Sec. 6AB.Sec. 6AB of the Act reads: 6AB- Prohibition of unauthorised exhibition of films-“no person shall use or abet the use of an infringing copy of any film to exhibit to the public for profit-In this piece, I will discuss the recently enacted Cinematograph (Amendment) Act, 2023 (see here) which introduced important changes to the ‘piracy regime’ in India. Further, I will critique the new institutional mechanism of nodal officers. I argue that while the current mechanism allows quick action, it vests nodal officers with wide and unguided powers which are prone to abuse and can detrimentally impact intermediaries. Lokesh in his post, discusses ‘intermediary liability’ in the new amendment. He points out that the Act enables increased control of the government over intermediaries by allowing it to act against intermediaries who are found to host pirated content. However, the Act leaves certain questions unanswered. Would ‘authorized place of the exhibition’ include digital platforms apart from physical theatres? Or would ‘film’ include digital OTT content? Or can the government take suo moto action against suspected content? Or who are considered intermediaries? What will be the institutional mechanism to take action against such alleged pirated content? The notification issued clarifies and concretises the combat mechanism against pirated content. The ‘Statement of Object and Reasons’ 2023 Act mentions the attempt to ‘curb the menace of film piracy by transmission of unauthorised copies on the internet.’ However, the current institutional mechanism of nodal officers raises various concerns. First, the amendment seeks to create an artificial distinction between Piracy and Copyright Act. Lokesh, points out here, that the Act avoids defining ‘Piracy’, which normally means copyright infringement. The aim for creating such distinction (without difference) seems to be to prescribe higher penalties for film piracy vis-à-vis Copyright Act. As a result, safe harbour protection (here, here and here) or ‘notice and takedown’ procedure, which provides strong due process protection to intermediaries and content uploader, is circumvented. This could lead to a regime where each intermediary has to pre-screen the content being uploaded as to whether it is an infringing copy or not. As argued here, the cost of instituting a fool proof pre-screening mechanism staffed by humans would be prohibitive, and would also require the companies to determine, subjectively, whether online content was defamatory, obscene, inflammatory, or infringing copyright.Second, with the absence of safe harbour provisions, there is a risk that an entire website besides the impugned URL may be blocked on receipt of a complaint by the copyright owner (here). Traditionally, as Prashant Reddy T. and Sumathi Chandrashekaran show in their book, there seems to exist a prominent bias amongst judges towards copyright owners, and a persistent failure of courts to grant proprietors of allegedly offending websites a hearing, before ordering them to be blocked. In fact, the notification includes a requirement of ‘hearing’ only when a complaint is filed by someone who does not own the copyright. Therefore, the risk of a legitimate website being blocked on a mere complaint of a copyright holder remains a potent threat which violates the tenets of natural justice. Concerningly, there is no requirement within the rules to prove copyright ownership. It takes considerable time, effort and money to again get the website unblocked which makes small intermediaries easy targets (see for e.g. pg. 243 of ‘Create Copy or Disrupt (here). On most occasions, a blocking order is not issued in public domain stating its reasons which violates principles of natural justice (see here for appeal mechanism).Third, the determination whether copyright infringement has occurred and if yes, whether infringement is ‘sufficient’ to block the URL/ website requires legal determination by a Judge trained in law (see for e.g. pg. 239 of this). On occasion, an infringing material might be saved by the fair use exemption under Copyright Act (here). The notification, however, entrusts this determination with nodal officers who are bureaucrats and regional officers. Earlier, in 2014, Calcutta HC entrusted Computer Emergency Response Team, India (CERT-IN) with the responsibility of blocking websites and URLs which were infringing copyright (here). However, later the onus was shifted back on ISPs recognising the limitation of Technical bodies. The same mistake is being committed by entrusting the same responsibilities with nodal officers. One, for third party complaints, the requirement of hearing is determined on a case by case basis which raises concerns of blocking/ taking down websites based on externally or politically motivated complaints without having to prove either copyright or basis of complaint. Another, since there are twelve nodal officers, nothing stops someone from forum shopping till the website is blocked. Fourth, as argued here, the penalties of contravening Sec. 6AB are ‘blunt and disproportionate’. Without safe harbour provision, intermediaries and content uploaders stand to be sentenced to jail for up to three years by a non-judicial officer, who, in turn, has no guideline to determine the quantum of fine or period of sentence. Combined with the wide discretion granted to nodal officers, this can create a chilling effect which discourages even fair use of the content in fear of arbitrary punishment. On one hand, a clear advantage of the newly introduced mechanism is it offers a more streamlined and swifter route to remove the infringing copy. On the other hand, it is apparent that such officers have been vested with power of courts to determine copyright infringement or piracy. Moreover, such powers remain overbroad and largely undefined and thus, prone to abuse. Nodal officers have been provided wide ranging powers with very few safeguards which on their own do not ensure the requirement of ‘due process’ being followed. In a bid to streamline the institutional mechanism against piracy, govt. has ignored the implications it will have on victims, piracy, and intermediaries. It has been previously argued here that the Cinematograph Act wrongly seeks to override the Copyright Act in combating piracy. The notification seems to set the clock back on gains made regarding entrusting technical bodies with blocking websites. Moreover, it entrusts them with unguided powers in imposing penalties on intermediaries and content uploaders without inserting the requirement of hearing. Although an institutional mechanism is needed to combat film piracy, the current mechanism is undesirable."

A Glimpse at the Ribociclib Case Deadline to File Comments/ Suggestions on IP Manuals Extended till November 15, 2023 Only 6 More Days to File Comments/ Suggestions on IP Manuals and Guidelines!",
    "data": "The World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) recently published its annual World IP Indicators for the year 2023, detailing the different trends in the filing of IP applications and the subsequent grants by IP offices across different jurisdictions. In this short post, I’ll take a look at the India-specific figures in terms of patent filings, grants, and procedural data about the Indian Patent Office. But before we get to India, let’s take a look at the countries with the most applications and grants. The Chinese Patent Office received the highest number of patent applications in 2022 (1.6 million) followed by the US (594,340) and Japan (289,530). The sequence remained the same for patent grants as well with China witnessing the highest numbers of patents granted (798,347), followed by the US (323,410) and Japan (201,420). With this, the countries with the highest number of patents in force are (you guessed it right) China (4.2 million), followed by the US (3.3 million) and Japan (2 million). Witnessing a growth of 25.2%, a total of 77,068 patent applications were filed in India in 2022. Of this, 38,551 applications were filed by Indian residents and 38,517 were filed by non-residents. Thus, this time residents applications have marginally overtaken the applications filed by non-residents. Additionally, 55,718 patent applications were filed by applicants from India across different patent offices. Of the 38,517 non-resident applicants filed in India, applicants from the US filed the most patent applications (249,294), followed by applicants from Japan (4,583), China (3,914), the Republic of Korea (2,817), and Germany (2,600). However, India witnessed a marginal dip (of 231) in the number of patents granted in 2022 in comparison to the patent granted in 2021. In 2022, 30,490 patents were granted by the Indian Patent Office, with 7,787 patents to Indian residents and 22,703 patents to non-Indian residents. With these grants, the number of patents in force in India is 128,663 with an average lifespan of 11.4 years, which is 1.6 years lower than what it was in 2017 (13 years). A total of 51,025 applications were processed by the Indian Patent Office in 2022. Out of this, patents were granted in 30,490 and rejected in 5,198, while 15,337 applications were abandoned or withdrawn. In contrast to this, Türkiye and the US granted patents to less than half of the applications processed in 2022.Of the selected 20 offices, India has the 6th highest number of examiners (597) with the US having the most examiners (8,234). The indicators also state that the average years of experience possessed by an Indian examiner is 5.9, which is quite low when compared to the experience of its Austrian counterpart (17.7 years). In terms of pendency, India has the second highest average pendency time (51 months), after Mexico (56 months), for first office action and final decision. Whereas, the Russian Federation has the least pendency time of 4.2 months. Presently, 249,294 applications are pending in the Indian Patent Office.The rise in the number of applications filed by Indian residents in comparison to non-resident applicants should definitely be applauded as after consistently lagging behind for years, Indian inventors are finally able to explore the patent system to a similar extent as non-residents. However, does this high number of patent filings and eventual grants indicate a growth in innovation? Swaraj writes in to suggest that there are at least 3 nuances to keep in mind before one jumps to this conclusion: 1) The quality of grants is a distinct question altogether, and one that often does not receive sufficient discussion. That is to say, granted patents do not necessarily equate to quality patents. It would be very useful to have metrics to measure this, but as far as I know, data is sparse in this regard. 2) Even ignoring the question of quality, there has been no evidence to support the often presupposed assumption that more patents = more innovation.Not only does innovation in different sectors require different types of incentives and policies, but some sectors actively do better with development friendly’ IP rather than standard maximalist IP.3) And finally – even if we assume high quality, and well thought out policy – the patents do need to be worked and not simply hoarded and sat upon! And on that at least, the data so far suggests that (certain large) companies are not only reluctant to show that they’re working their patents, but also lobby to change the law requiring them to show it!It does appear that many changes are happening in the Patent Office, and it would be wonderful to see these nuances taken seriously and discussed further, to help India utilise its IP systems to maximise the talent and innovative capacity it has!"

A Glimpse at the Ribociclib Case Intellectual Rigour, Redefining Judicial Courage: Supreme Court Justice SR Bhat’s Rich Legacy",
    "data": "[This post has been co-authored by Swaraj Paul Barooah and Pranav Aggarwal. Pranav is a second-year student pursuing B.A.LL.B.(Hons) at Rajiv Gandhi National University of Law, Punjab. He has a keen interest in commercial laws, especially in IP and allied fields. His previous post can be accessed here].On September 29th, 2023, the Pharma giant, Johnson and Johnson (“J&J”) made headlines around the world after they (finally) announced that they will no longer enforce their patents for bedaquiline (brand name: Sirturo) which is used in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in 134 low- and middle-income countries. As readers may know, in India, tuberculosis has been causing hundreds of thousands of deaths a year, for decades now. This, despite the various moving targets of eliminating TB from time to time, as well as the WHO declaring it a Global Health Emergency as far back as 1993 (30 years ago!). Bedaquiline is also in the List of Essential Medicines by the World Health Organisation. So, we thought we’d look into what this announcement might mean for India, as well as the rest of the world. Interestingly, the first patent for Sirturo was filed on 18/07/2003 (PCT/EP2003/050322), meaning it is (more than) 20 years since their first filing. And earlier this year, the Indian patent office rejected their attempt to file a secondary patent on the drug. Anyhow, we’ll come back to this in a bit. Let’s first look at what exactly was said in the announcement. “…[J&J] today confirmed its intent not to enforce patents it owns and controls for SIRTURO® (bedaquiline) in the treatment of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) in 134 low- and middle-income countries[1,2].The decision is intended to assure current and future generic manufacturers that they may manufacture and sell high quality generic versions of SIRTURO® without a concern that the Company will enforce its bedaquiline patents, provided the generic versions of SIRTURO® produced or supplied by generic manufacturers are of good quality, medically acceptable, and are used only in the 134 low- and middle-income countries.” First off, it is clear that this is not a legal commitment to not enforce its patents, but rather a confirmation of its “intent” not to enforce its patents. They have also not specified which patents are covered by this. According to a UNITAID report, there are at least 5 Janssen patents associated with bedaquiline. The stated intention is to assure generic manufacturers that they can proceed with manufacturing bedaquiline, under 2 conditions: quality, and usage (only) in the 134 LMICs. For practical purposes, this is likely to suffice, as it would lead to quite the PR disaster if J&J reneged on this. (But then again, let’s not forget Moderna who revoked its patent pledge right before suing Pfizer for infringing its COVID-19 vaccine patent). Indeed, companies like Lupin, Natco, and Macleods have already shown interest in manufacturing, which would indicate that they see a positive business interest in pursuing this manufacturing. Interestingly, J&J’s reasons for this announcement are claimed to be to address the under-diagnosis problem with MDR-TB. They’re not wrong that under-diagnosis is a very large problem, but claiming there is a strong connection between under-diagnosis and not-enforcing patents seems a bit of a stretch! Of course, claiming the reason was lack of access to the drug, would be undesirable from their own PR front, as it would admit that they could’ve done more for all these years and did not. Especially given how much noise public health groups have been making about this. Nonetheless, if there is indeed some connection between these two, it would be useful to see this evidence.Finally, while they mention that they won’t enforce their bedaquiline patents in 134 LMICs, it seems curious that they haven’t directly mentioned which countries, but rather say it is available on request. We sent a request for this list on 3rd October and are yet to receive a response as of date (9th November). Nonetheless, the interesting part is that there are only 134 LMICs, as per the World Bank categorizations, so it is once again a curious choice not to simply mention them.According to the Global Tuberculosis Report 2023, although the cases of Tuberculosis have been de-accelerating, the different variants like MDR-TB haven’t been controlled properly especially after Covid-19. Globally, the burden of multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB), which had been decreasing till 2019, jumped up again in 2021, with an increase of 3.1% from 2020 with 2020-21 having 4,50,000 new cases.Surprisingly, a huge chunk (42%) of the MDR-TB cases are concentrated in three countries: India (26%), Russia (8.5%), Pakistan (7.9%). Other major countries that are highly affected are Indonesia, China, Philippines and Myanmar. Janssen (J&J’s pharma entity) drug bedaquiline, which was the first new treatment for TB approved in several decades, catalyzes a shorter, easier-to-administer, and more parent-tolerable treatment regimen. It was approved through an accelerated approval process based on partial trials, i.e., Phase 2 trials in the US in 2012, and EU in 2013, following which the WHO released its Interim Policy Guidelines to guide usage in the absence of Phase 3 trials. In the years after this, Janssen entered into collaborations with several other actors (including in academia, non-governmental organizations and governments) to take it through to Phase 3 trials and to address the range of research questions to use it to its full potential. Exactly how much went into the development, is, as usual, an unknown answer. Some studies, for eg, Gotham et al (2020) show that total public investments (USD 455-747 million) are several times higher than Janssen’s investments (USD 90-240 million). Meanwhile, Janssen has claimed they made R&D expenditures of approximately USD 500 million, though without any breakdown. (Fn 12 of the same paper). Regardless of who invested how much, Janssen does have ownership over at least 5 patents, as mentioned above, and this is what we look at below. In 2003, the Company made a patent application, PCT/EP2003/050322, under Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) of a chemical compound, Quinoline, the fumarate salt, which is used as mycobacterial inhibitors and further production of MDR-TB Drugs like Bedaquiline. The application WO2004/011436, was published in 2004. This meant that most of the countries where the company got the patent through PCT would have anyway expired by this year. This patent (corresponding Indian application number: 220/DELNP/2005) has already expired in the ‘market’ with the most number of patients, i.e. India.As mentioned above, there are 4 more applications. One of these (1220/MUMNP/2009) was rejected by the Indian patent office earlier this year. The three other applications are still pending before the patent office. These are 6315/DELNP/2006 , IN202017005443, and 20172703004. The latter two here have oppositions pending against them as well, filed by Delhi Network of Positive People and Ganesh Acharya for both the patents. The UNITAID patent landscape report has a few more details such as rejected/granted status in other countries, for those interested. At a glance, it appears these have been opposed by various interest groups in countries like South Africa, Belgium and Sweden or have been denied subsequent patents as in the case of India. As mentioned above, India accounts for the highest no. of cases of MDR-TB and as per the Ministry of Health’s Indian TB Report (PDF), around 1,19,000 cases were reported in India alone in 2021. Therefore, the need for a drug like Bedaquiline cannot be emphasized more. The Government of India issued guidelines in regard to the usage of Bedaquiline. Interestingly enough, the drug on the basis of the WHO recommendation and the approval given by the United States Federal Drug Authority in 2012 was allowed in India by the Drug Controller General of India (DGCI) without any local trials. The whole regulation was done through the Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) as far as the availability of the medicine were to be ensured. For a brief overview of the introduction of Bedaquiline in India and concerns about introducing it at this stage, readers can refer to posts such as this one on the blog.Aside from the now expired ‘main’ patent (220/DELNP/2005) there was an attempt of a follow-on patent through Janssen’s application 1220/MUMNP/2009 which could extend its exclusivity for four more years. This was met with considerable opposition by two TB survivors and the application was ultimately rejected by the Patent office in March 2023. As described in the linked post, it was denied on the grounds of Section 3(d) and 3(e) of the Patents Act 1970 as the current application evidently drew from the previous granted patent and lacks inventive steps as provided under section 2(1)(ja). As per this WHO report (PDF – p.29) the drug costs between USD 900 (low income countries) to USD 30,000 (high income countries) per patient for a 6 month course. The cost of production (Gotham et al, 2017), is estimated to be just around US$130. So, with the estimated relatively low cost of development, along with the estimated low cost of production, and with the patents either being rejected, expired or opposed in most places, it does leave open the question of how much meaning this non-enforcement actually has. Mere window dressing or genuine promotion of increased manufacturing, whatever may be the motive of the Company, increased production (as is expected with more generics on board) will hopefully come to the aid of the patients for whom such drugs were neither affordable nor accessible till now. Not just for India, but other LMICs like Pakistan, Myanmar and Indonesia etc. as well."

    "data": "[This post has been co-authored with Rahul Bajaj. All views expressed are personal].Market dynamics in the health and innovation space are making the biotech and life sciences sector an industry to watch out for. Trends such as the association of AI with life sciences, the growth of start-ups / non-traditional companies investing in life sciences, reduced spending on small molecule-drugs and promising new biotech treatments, indicate that windows of opportunity for investment in this sector are opening up. Unlike small molecule drugs, biologics are large and complex substances. Typically, biologics are produced from living cells with the exception of emerging technologies such as the mRNA platform. Since living cells and products of nature are often involved in these inventions, clarity regarding patent eligibility is becoming more important.The discovery, development and patenting of biologics has been historically tied to the ‘product of nature’ question under patent law. Jurisprudence around product-of-nature subject matter has significantly developed in jurisdictions such as the US and EU. For example, as early as 1981, the US Supreme Court excluded “[l]aws of nature, natural phenomena, and abstract ideas” from patent protection. [Diamond v. Diehr] Over the years, the Supreme Court tried to clarify this exclusion to allow patent protection for inventions that were “significantly more” than just “laws of nature, natural phenomena and abstract ideas”. [Bilski v. Kappos, Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, Ass’n for Molecular Pathology v. Myriad Genetics and Alice Corp. v. CLS Bank Int’l.] Notably, in Myriad, genomic DNA was held to be a ‘product of nature’ and ineligible for patent protection. But complementary DNA (cDNA) that is created with human intervention in labs was held to be patentable subject matter.Patent laws in India on the question of ‘products of nature’ are much less developed. Section 2(ja) of the Patents Act, 1970 defines an invention as a new product or process involving an inventive step and capable of industrial application and Section 3 specifies various bars to patent protection. For product-of-nature subject matter, the primary restrictions under Section 3 are:Indian courts have not had the opportunity to interpret the scope of many of these exclusions. Through our research we were able to identify only the following few IPAB cases that discuss (albeit tangentially) some of these exclusions. Note, however, that there is no clarity as yet on the legal force of IPAB orders, whether they are mandatory or persuasive – see here.Further, many cases discussed below do not relate to biotech inventions. The principles from these cases can, however, be applied to emerging biotech inventions many of which are admixtures and involve microorganisms.On S. 3(e), in La Renon Health Care Pvt. Ltd. v. Kibow Biotech Inc., the IPAB had to rule on the patentability of a pharmaceutical composition used to treat renal hepatic and gastrointestinal diseases. The IPAB held that the invention was hit by the obviousness bar, as the use of each of the integers involved in the invention was known from the prior art. Also, there was no: “interworking between the integers to result in a synergistic effect.” The invention only involved an admixture of known integers and no inventive step was achieved by the same. As the invention did not entail a new product or a technical advance, it was held to be obvious to a person skilled in the art.In Asthristis Relied Plus Ltd. v. Controller of Patents and Designs, the IPAB, in ruling on the patentability of a drug formulation, held that the bar under S. 3(e) was not attracted. This was because the synergistic effect of the invention was apparent, namely that the two ingredients used in the formulation, when brought together, were able to have a greater impact on addressing the problem of stiffness of joints. The Court also repelled the challenge to the invention based on S. 3(j). It held that the invention encompassed a topical formulation of comfrey and tannic acid in a particular proportion and was therefore patentable.The above cases show that a mere admixture of known substances is not inventive but there is a need to show ‘synergistic effect’ achieved by the combination as a whole. Under S. 3 (j), while plants and animals in whole or any part themselves are not patentable subject matter, a ‘formulation’ made from a plant is not excluded. In addition to these cases, the Patent Manual on Practice and Procedure [2019] offers some guidance on the provisions discussed above. On S. 3(e) it states that the relationship between features/groups of features be one of “functional reciprocity”/ showing a “combinative effect” beyond the sum of their individual elements. On S. 3(j), the manual clarifies that microorganisms, other than those that are naturally occurring, may be patentable. The issue of gene patents and eligibility under S. 3(j) was discussed in the context of NSAI v. Monsanto in our post here. The case involved Monsanto’s Bt gene technology which makes selected seeds resistant to certain pests and associated issues with licensing, infringement and pricing. While the patent eligibility issue i.e. the Section 3(j) prohibition on patenting of plants, seeds or any part thereof, and whether a patentee should be allowed to seek a gene patent in conjunction with a certain plant genome was one of the central points of policy discussions, to our knowledge this issue was never litigated. Therefore, there still remains legal uncertainty on the scope and extent of gene patents.Apart from the above, Section 3(i) on diagnostic methods has been subject to considerable debate. Recently, the Madras High Court in Chinese University of Hong Kong and Anr. V. Assistant Controller of Patents, discussed the scope and extent of this provision. A detailed analysis of this judgement will follow in another post.The meaning and scope of Section 3 exclusions are important to understand as they can have an impact on development of new cures and on innovation. Specifically, the exclusions cannot be too broad, as that would have a chilling effect on investments for new cures. Equally, they cannot be too narrow, so as to harm the public interest in ensuring affordable access and broad dissemination of such innovations. Product of nature patents will continue to remain an important area to monitor in the times to come.Thanks to Arkadeep Poddar, NUJS, and Ahsnat Mokarim for their assistance."

    "headline": "Journey Through “Septembers” on SpicyIP (2005 – Present) Journey Through “Augusts” on SpicyIP (2005 – Present) Journey Through “Julys” on SpicyIP (2005 – Present)",
    "data": "Image from hereAs October passed, Halloween festivities and the Day of the Dead provided a backdrop for contemplating the past. After all, reflecting on what’s passed helps us anticipate what’s ahead. This brings me to my Octobers’ sift – a sift that yielded some sinuous IP stories. Those who haven’t checked our Sifting Through SpicyIP Pages series yet, can check SpicyIP Flashbacks and see what we found thus far while journeying through the months of Junes, Julys, Augusts, and Septembers. They included stories of the Patent Agent examination, the Indian Innovation Act, the opening of the Trademark database, the presumption of patent validity, and the South Asian Basmati fights and more.Without further ado, here’s what the Octobers offered:Serial Crisis in India, Anything new?: Around a decade ago, in October, Swaraj discussed Indian science officials expressing their concern over the unaffordable subscriptions. This is a “serials crisis” i.e., a situation when rising subscription costs for scholarly journals exceed academic library budgets, hampering researchers’ access. Tellingly, Indian academics are not the only ones affected, even the world’s most prestigious universities have expressed their concern over this. Those who tried to intervene, such as Diego A. Gómez Hoyos and Aaron Swartz, faced serious consequences. One may ask – is open access a solution? Maybe. Maybe not. Swaraj’s post is on this point. More specifically, is Copyright a Hindrance for Open Access in India? (I am not even wading into the Bogus Open Access Journals and The dark side of the scientific publishing industry). What else? Is Creative Commons a solution? Maybe! Check Justice Prabha Sridevan’s post ‘Cultivating The Commons’, drawing our attention to the idea that “Access to education is not ancestral property, it is common property.”This brings me to broader issues of education/science/knowledge; DU Photocopy and Sci-Hub cases need highlighting here. The former, a highly hailed Indian case with a few counterviews, raised questions about access to educational material. The latter, currently pending, involves questions about the legality of shadow libraries, engines that fuel much of the research in India (Here’s a mini-survey). I recommend reading Nikhil’s 3-part post examining the Sci-hub case and Divij’s post examining Sci-Hub and the Disruption of the Academic Publishing Industry. In another development, Publishers united to Fight Copyright Infringement on ResearchGate, although it was settled out of court. Nonetheless, what’s the solution in the long run – abolishing copyright from scholarly works as Steven Shavell proposed; disallowing corporate assignment of copyright over scholarly works, akin to Akshat’s suggestion in the music industry context; revamping Legal Deposit under The Delivery of Books and Newspaper (Public Libraries) Act 1954. Or, maybe thinking of a new right, such as a “Right to Research.” Needless to say, these aren’t the main/only solutions. We must think through these and more solutions and do so sooner rather than later. As Swaraj said, it’s Time to More Seriously Question the Spectre of Copyright in the Realm of Education.Whither Clinical Trial Data?: In an October 2012 post, Kruttika Vijay highlighted the Supreme Court’s concerns over the lack of transparency in clinical trials in India. For context, these trials are conducted by pharmaceutical companies as R&D to, evaluate the efficacy, risks, and health benefits of new drugs/components. Access to clinical trial data not only helps drug innovation but also impacts consumer benefits and drug pricing. Class 5.1 and Class 5.2 of our IP Reveries series, while discussing the basics of clinical trials and drug innovation, have highlighted their implications. Prof. Basheer, in his 2009 post, about Chantix, a Pfizer-patented anti-smoking drug, raised questions regarding transparency around the discretion to require local clinical trials. Kruttika’s poignant post in the same year, ran a persuasive case of publishing clinical trial data, discussing when public interest in trial data outweighs commercial interest. This issue continues to surface, often concerning data exclusivity, which does not cover test data. See two related posts here and here. Nevertheless, such data, regardless of their apparent public interest implication, are not disclosed to the public. More recently, the issue of clinical trial data came up during COVID-19 when the clinical trial data of Covaxin were not shared. Read Anupriya’s excellent post here.Speaking of this topic, I can’t miss Bedaquiline, the first new drug to receive approval to treat tuberculosis (TB) in over 40 years, which raised serious questions about its marketing approval without mandatory Phase III clinical trials in India and around informed consent of Indian patients. Thanks to Prashant, who has substantially worked and written on this issue, for bringing this issue to the fore. Prashant and Balaji’s well-worded Special Report: The Smoke & Mirrors Surrounding the Approval of Bedaquiline examined the issue in detail. In other posts, he discussed the legal and ethical concerns around Bedaquiline. Trust me, the issue was super-intense with discussions spread across several interconnected fronts, including reporting (see also), RTIs (see also), advocacy, activism, and WHO. The issue is also discussed in his and Dinesh Thakur’s book ‘The Truth Pill: The Myth of Drug Regulation in India. Hopefully, we’ll see a greater and more active engagement on this issue in the future.The Recording of Court Proceedings in 2008: In October 2008, Mihir discussed a case in the Supreme Court that considered recording its proceedings as a move toward judicial transparency. It mightn’t be astonishing today, but it was an advanced move then, given the issue of accessing court records at that time. Mihir nicely discussed the usefulness of such a move for lawyers, appellate courts, legal scholars, etc. Surely, we have come a long way over the years, now, court recordings are a common thing. However, the destination is still afar (read the Junes’ Sift). Also, there are some copyright issues around the streaming of court proceedings as Niyati discussed. Speaking of which reminds me of a recent case where a court used copyright to take down an already aired court recording showing a judge apologizing to another judge after a heated discussion. One may wonder how the said judicial transparency interplays with commercial cases. For insights, read Anupriya’s post on Interdigital v. Xiaomi highlighting how the common practice of courts granting confidentiality in commercial litigation problematizes transparency, judicial accountability, and the citizens’ right to be informed of court processes and reasoning under Article 19(1)(a). It bears noting, however, that confidentiality may be a valid concern and shouldn’t be just disregarded for transparency alone. This decision should be made on a careful assessment of several objective factors. Moreover, the increasing emphasis on the Right to be Forgotten needs to be carefully balanced with access to public records and an open court system.Nevertheless, with the increasing impact of copyright and privacy on the flow of information, the path of transparency seems to be becoming more and more turbulent, warranting more attention and closer scrutiny than before. Corruption in IP Offices, Anything New? – Once upon a time, as Prashant noted in his October 2011 post, a trademark application was filed, examined, and published within a mere 72 hours at the Chennai Trademarks Registry. This extraordinary speed raised questions about whether it was super efficiency or super corruption. But this is not all! Here’s the backstory of this revelation: taking the lead from Sumathi’s post, the investigation was done by Mr. Balakrishnan, a Coimbatore-based IP lawyer, who in the process exposed the striking corruption at the Chennai TMR. In 2011, the same IP office also witnessed the arrest of a high-ranking Registrar on charges of massive corruption and disproportionate assets after a CBI investigation. The person was later convicted in 2016. Speaking of these issues, the Manjal matter needs highlighting where the mark was problematically removed by the same arrested registrar. This raised a question did the registrar of Trade Marks have the jurisdiction to revoke the ‘MANJAL’ trademark?, which Prashant discussed in his post.Sadly, this extends beyond the Trade Mark office; it carries broader implications for transparency and overall administration, ultimately influencing the accountability of public officials. Given troubling record-keeping practices at the IPO including instances of missing files at trademark (see also here), copyright, and patent offices (see also here), the issue cuts deeper, deeper than what we can see and surmise logically. Read Akshay Ajayakumar’s posts about the dismal examination standards disregarding the mandatory requirements of Collective and Certification marks. For collective marks, he argued that out of 10 collective mark registrations he examined, 9 were granted erroneously. Also, check Joff Wild on the Allegations Against Indian Patent Office. Before ending this story here, I’d direct readers to two intriguing posts by Prof. Basheer’s Hazare Hunger and Policy Making and Gandhi Comes to WIPO, offering food for thought and inviting deeper contemplation on the issues of governance and administration. Origin and Turns of the Ad-Words cases: Prashant, in October 2009, shared the news of the Madras High Court vacating ex-parte interim injunction against Google’s ad-word program (see also here). The vacated order restrained Google from infringing Consim’s trademark on Bharat Matrimony. “Ad-word” … yes, the very same thing that recently made headlines, again! Let’s see how it unfolded. So … Prashant’s post was followed by a detailed post on Adwords and Trademark Law cautioning that a traditional interpretation of “use in commerce” could jeopardize the rights of trademark owners, given the evolving business models. Then, in 2010, the European Court of Justice ruled in favor of the Google Adwords Program holding such use to be non-infringing. In the following years, a Dutch Court applied the ECJ Google ruling and a French Appellate court also ruled in Google’s favor. Although Google faced some challenges and penalties before the Competition Commission of India, and Indian start-ups complained about unfair Google Ad-Sense contracts, more or less, things were in Google’s favour on the trademark front.Fast forward to 2022, which wasn’t a very good year, as DHC restrained some defendants from using the plaintiff’s registered marks on the Google Ads Program for trademark infringement and passing-off. However, 2023 seems good for Google, thus far. Aditya discussed Google v. DRS, where the court held that ad-words are not inherently violative of trademark rights. A brand owner’s injunction now depends on the ad’s content, checking if the same confuses or causes blurring or tarnishment. Only then does Google need to take action against the advertisement and not otherwise. But what are the implications of this (not-so-straightforward?) ruling on Indian businesses and trademark holders? Nivrati Gupta essayed to answer that in her post discussing the evolving legal dynamics of trademark use in Internet advertising, and its impact on businesses.Well, this wraps up our Octobers’ sift. Next time, I’ll sail on a fresh journey through the pages of “Novembers.” If there are any posts or events that slipped my sight, feel free to share them in the comments. Until then, see you next month!Thanks to Swaraj Barooah for his input on this piece."

Clarification on Divisional Applications SpicyIP Tidbit: Advocate Faces Music for Concocting a Fake IPAB Order!",
    "data": "[This post is co-authored by with Swaraj Paul Barooah. The authors would like to thank Aditya Gupta for his input. Views remain those of the authors’ alone.]In a major development bound to impact IP litigation in Delhi, a Division Bench (DB) of the Delhi High Court in Pankaj Ravjibhai Patel v. SSS Pharmachem Pvt. Ltd overruled the Single Judge’s key directions in Vishal Pipes Ltd. v. Bhavya Pipe Industry. To quickly recap, the Vishal Pipes judgement directed that all IP suits filed at the District Court level be automatically listed before a District Judge (Commercial) regardless of their valuation. This finding was based on the presumption that IP suits ought to be valued more than the prescribed threshold of INR 3 lakhs and in case the suit value falls below this amount, the plaintiff is trying to escape the rigours of the Commercial Courts Act (CCA). (Mathews in this incisive post has discussed the Vishal Pipes judgement and I’d strongly suggest our readers read this post, along with the long trail of comments there for a better understanding of the issues). Disagreeing with this, the DB in Pankaj Ravjibhai Patel clarified that it would be incorrect to presume that IP suits have to be valued at 3 lakhs or more, and that the direction to list all IP matters before the commercial courts distorts the distribution of matters before the commercial and non-commercial courts. Thus, the DB suggested that the concerned court will be open to assessing the specified value if the valuation is pegged below INR 3 lakhs. And to shift the onus on the plaintiff in such suits, directed them to make an express declaration that they have not taken an inconsistent stand regarding the specified value in any present or past litigation. The court also directed to revert all the IP matters back to the competent court which would have been transferred to a commercial court consequent to the Vishal Pipes judgement (more on this below). Before we come to the DB judgement, let’s try to understand what the Vishal Pipes directions are about and why they were passed in the first place. The Vishal Pipes judgement is based on the apprehension that some parties are deliberately undervaluing their IP suits to get them listed before non-commercial courts. Though it acknowledged that the plaintiff, being the dominus litis (master of the suit), can choose the forum and the remedy, the court held that this flexibility cannot allow the plaintiff to deliberately undervalue the suit to escape the rigours of the CCA or indulge in forum shopping. So, what are these rigours of the CCA? The CCA prescribes mandatory pre-institution mediation, case management hearings, the requirement of plaint to be submitted along with different accompanying documents like the statement of truth, the requirement of filing detailed written arguments before the commencement of the oral hearings, imposes rigorous checks on filing additional documents and imposes rigorous checks on amending plaints are some of the rigours of the CCA (see para. 35(i) of the Vishal Pipes judgement). According to the court, by undervaluing their suit, the plaintiff can escape these checks and effectively place it before the non-commercial court instead which do not require such measures. Further, it is understood that the CCA was brought in place not only to adjudicate commercial disputes but also to expedite the resolution of these disputes. Furthermore, as discussed by Mathews in this (paywalled) paper here, if the provisions of CCA are implemented efficiently, then the trials can be completed within 6 months from the first date of the case management hearing, and thus may bring down the relevance of interim injunctions. As has been discussed earlier on the blog (see here, here and here) and opined by the Supreme Court (here and here), obtaining interim injunctions is often regarded as the be-all and end-all when instituting an IP suit, as the trial takes ages to conclude and thus, making it an interesting litigation strategy. This leads us to another question- how are matters listed before the commercial courts and what is so special about IP suits? Matters are listed before a commercial court on the basis of their subject matter and valuation. While an IP suit is a commercial dispute (as per S. 2(c)(xvii)) whether it can be listed before a commercial court or not depends on the specified value. Looking at S.2(1)(i) r/w S.12 of the CCA, the specified value is determined on the basis of the market value of the IP as estimated by the Plaintiff and for the dispute to be listed before the commercial court, it has to be more than INR 3 lakhs. However, as seen in Vishal Pipes, sometimes parties may not state the specified value and simply value the suit by giving an estimate of the relief that they are seeking, as prescribed under the Court Fees Act and the Suit Valuation Act. (Here it is important to note that no factors are prescribed for such estimates and the discretion lies with the plaintiff to value it accordingly). This may result in a situation where despite having a high (but unstated) specified value, the suit is being valued at less than the INR 3 lakhs threshold, on the basis of the relief sought. The court in Vishal Pipes found this anomaly to be quixotic. This was because on one hand, the plaintiff had filed a trademark infringement suit for a brand enjoying high turnover, whereas, on the other hand, it had valued the suit at less than INR 3 lakhs. It asserted that IP suits are commercial disputes for whose adjudication CCA has prescribed the low threshold of 3 Lakhs to enable speedier adjudication and thus, despite this low threshold if the suits are being undervalued, the court inferred this as an attempt to escape the rigours of the CCA. The court gave a set of directions that were to affect IP litigation in Delhi:- While the anomaly between high-valued brands valuing the suits low, based on relief is certainly a valid concern, the method of resolving it appears to have left some questions unanswered and this is what the DB focused on. Here, the appellant appealed against the vacating of an ex-parte interim injunction by the commercial court. The impugned order had asked the appellant to furnish additional documents in support of its specified value. It argued that the commercial court decided to assess the specified value and suit value on the basis of Vishal Pipes, ignoring that the suit was already valued at 10 lakhs, thus exceeding the 3 lakhs threshold. The DB set aside the impugned order stating that the mistake on the part of the appellant to submit particulars to justify the specified value was curable and did not merit vacation of the injunction. In doing so, the court expressed its reservation on some of the findings of the Vishal Pipes judgement and went on to assess the directions passed in it.The court disagreed with Vishal Pipes on the latter’s statement that IP suits should ordinarily be valued at more than INR 3 lakhs, as well as that the undervaluation (if any) is done to escape the rigours of the CCA or to forum shop. The DB held that the court in Vishal Pipes proceeded on a presumption about a premise “which is wholly conjectural and it amounts to painting all actions, legitimate or otherwise, with a common brush.”.Thus, setting aside the Single Judge’s directions in Vishal Pipes, the DB ruled that :- The Vishal Pipes judgement intended to bring CCA in full gear for all IP disputes. But in doing so it simply deferred to one aspect of the prescribed two i.e. it simply relied on IP suits being a “commercial dispute” but didn’t consider the valuation threshold and presumed that IP suits ought to be valued at more than 3 lakhs. Realistically, as pointed out by appointed amicus curiae Swathi Sukumar (and by Shobhit and Eashan in their comments to Mathews’ post), there can be instances where though the specified value of an IP will be more than 3 lakhs, the suit valuation based on the relief claimed could be less than that. In such a case, the Vishal Pipes rationale suspected foul play, and on this presumption directed all the IP matters to be listed before the commercial courts. However, in doing so, the Single Judge seems to have created a separate ‘category’ for IP disputes, without it being clear how this was permissible under the CCA. The DB judgement has now tried to remove this suspicion, restoring the status quo ante the Vishal Pipes judgement. However, in doing so all the matters which were earlier removed from non-commercial courts to the commercial courts, will be reverted back. This not only discounts the judicial time that has been invested by the commercial courts on such matters but will further result in inconvenience to the parties to get their matters reverted back to the non-commercial courts and will also drastically change the pace at which the matters will be processed hereon. Looking back at how this started, the Single Judge court did raise important concerns about forum shopping and deliberate undervaluation to escape the rigours of the CCA. So the question that pops up now is- how far do the DB’s directions go to address these situations? The court has adopted a flexible approach towards it and has held that the competent courts “will be open” to examine the declared specified value and value of relief claimed if pegged below INR 3 lakhs. However, as evident from the phrase “will be open”, this safeguard seems more like a guideline than a direction and would leave it upon the discretion of the concerned court to look into the matter. Thus, this directive can be fruitful in cases where a court actively investigates this issue, otherwise, the issue of deliberate undervaluation can easily escape under the radar. The DB’s instructions of a mandatory declaration (see point 2 above), pragmatically may not be of much use. There are different methods of valuing IP (depending on income, cost, market, etc), so there is already a lot of leeway present. Further, the direction does not state clearly the particulars of what needs to be declared here. Therefore, this safeguard could be easily circumvented by clever drafting, by only limiting the valuation for the purpose of the present suit and simultaneously making a vague declaration that the same is not inconsistent with the position taken by the plaintiff with regard to its specified value, in other litigations. In sum, while the DB may have been right about the removal of automatic suspicion, its alternative is probably insufficient for addressing the problem that started this train. Perhaps, this should be for the rules / law to address, rather than the judiciary? Meanwhile, something that the judiciary can perhaps focus on addressing is why the non/commercial courts are allowing easy injunctions (if that is the harm that is being sought to be addressed), or why there is not more strict scrutiny of loose claims. And regarding timelines, while strict timelines for commercial courts is fine, shouldn’t there be a focus on more efficient timelines for all courts, which, other than being a desirable end in and of itself, would also remove incentive for parties to be choosing forums based on where they can sit on injunctions for long periods of time?

(Hons.) student at National Law School of India University, Bengaluru. He is interested in IP Law, Constitutional Law and Criminal Law. His previous posts can be accessed here.]Recently on October 16, 2023, the Delhi High Court in Ayur United Care LLP v. UOI made important observations regarding the listing of writ petitions challenging orders passed by the (now abolished) Intellectual Property Appellate Board. The question for determination was whether writ petitions, challenging orders passed by the IPAB, filed before the abolition of the IPAB on 4 April 2021, would have to be heard by a Single Bench or by a Division Bench of this Court. It held:“Rule 4, read with Rule 2(i) and 2(l) of the IPD Rules require writ petitions, challenging orders passed by the IPAB, to be decided by Single Judges…any hesitation or refusal, by the Single Judge, to hear these petitions, short of recusal, would amount to abdication of the judicial function vested in him.”In this post, I will be focusing on the observations made by the court regarding the hierarchy between a Single Judge bench and the IPAB.As a brief background, the order stems from a bunch of writ petitions filed against the IPAB order dated 28 June 2013, whereby the Board had allowed rectification petitions challenging the registration of the “Ayur” mark in favor of Ayur United Care (petitioner).The respondents argued that there would arise an ‘incongruous’ and ‘anomalous’ situation if challenges against rectification petitions filed between 2003 and 2021 before the IPAB would lie before a Single Judge bench of a High Court. Why? Because, as argued by the respondents, after the abolition of IPAB, status quo ante 2003 stood restored. In clear words, prior to 2003, rectification petitions were decided by a Single Judge bench. However, with the constitution of the IPAB in 2003, these matters were transferred to the IPAB. Therefore, IPAB was essentially exercising the very same jurisdiction that the Single Judge was exercising prior to the establishment of the IPAB. Therefore, the respondents argued that after the abolition of the IPAB, challenges against rectification petitions decided by IPAB would lie only before a division bench. The court termed the above argument to mean that a Single Judge “stepped into the shoes of the IPAB”. It denied the assertion of restoration of status quo ante. Rather, it held that when a Single Judge presides over a matter challenging the order by IPAB, they are not doing it as a successor of IPAB or IPAB in disguise. Instead, the decision rendered by the court is ‘pre-eminently the decision of the Single Judge’ which is not equal to the decision rendered by IPAB.The court effectively repudiated the argument that there existed any parity between the jurisdiction exercised by IPAB and a Single Judge bench. It noted that a Single Judge bench of a High Court is “hierarchically or at least judicially superior authority” to IPAB. The court elaborated on this reasoning by explaining that while hearing and deciding a challenge to an order passed by the IPAB, the court is exercising supervisory jurisdiction as well as the jurisdiction of judicial review over the decision of the IPAB and while deciding upon an original rectification petition, the court is exercising its original jurisdiction vested in it by statute. Based on the above findings, it appears that the court rejected the “stepping into the shoes” argument on two grounds-First, by explaining that IPAB and a Single Judge bench do not stand on the same footing. Rather, the court emphasized the latter is judicially superior with supervisory jurisdiction over the former. In sum, it cannot be said that IPAB, in the judicial hierarchy, was equivalent to a Single Judge bench. As a result, the argument that a Single Judge has stepped into the shoes of the IPAB, and restored the status quo ante is erroneous.Second, by interpreting the relevant provisions of the IPD Rules and the Delhi High Court Rules to conclude that a single judge bench is vested with the jurisdiction to hear writ challenges to an IPAB order. Giving wide interpretation to the term “IPR subject matter” the court first held that a writ challenging IPAB order will fall under the ambit of “IPR Subject matter” defined under Rule 2 (i) of the IPD Rules. Then, the court reasoned that the statutory mandate under Rule 4 of IPD Rules (prescribing the jurisdiction of the Single Judge to hear every case or proceeding concerning an IPR subject matter filed or transferred before the IPD), read in conjunction with Rule 1 in Part B in Chapter 3 of Volume V of the Delhi High Court Rules (prescribing the list of cases which are ordinarily heard by the Single Judge, including a writ petition), unambiguously requires that such writ petitions be necessarily heard by a Single Judge bench.Though the court’s interpretation here seems to be on point, to properly understand the impact and merits of the order, it’s necessary to look at the relevant mechanism before the abolition of the IPAB. The Intellectual Property Appellate Board (IPAB) was constituted under the Trademarks Act, 1999 to hear rectification petitions, and appeals against the decisions of the Registrar and the Controller of Patents. While the substantive laws prescribed the mechanism of how these proceedings are to be conducted before the IPAB, no dedicated provision on the appeal against an order from the IPAB was given under any law (see third paragraph here). In fact, in the present case as well, though the High Court in para 17.4.3 observed that the single judge was acting as a superior authority while hearing “appeals” against the IPAB orders, it did not discuss under which provisions these “appeals” were filed earlier. Regardless, looking at this press release from 2019, explaining the solution for this lacunae, it seems like prior to the abolition of the IPAB, an aggrieved party could have filed a writ petition against the order of the IPAB before a High Court (and consequently before the Single Judge, as per Rule (xviii)(a), Part B, of the Delhi High Court Rules) under Article 226 or a Special Leave Petition before the Supreme Court.The enactment of The Tribunals Reforms (Rationalization and Conditions of Service) Ordinance 2021 abolished IPAB. The powers of IPAB with respect to revocation of patents u/s 64 of the Patents Act 1970 or to entertain rectification petitions u/s 57 the Trademark Act have now been transferred to the High Courts. Also, under Sec. 117A of the Patent Act, and Section 91 of the Trademarks Act appeals from the decision, order, or direction from the central government or the controller, as the case shall directly lie before the High Court.Some of the key benefits of this move, as pointed out by Prashant here, are- First, the compulsory listing of the challenge before a Single judge bench gives another opportunity to provide diverse judicial viewpoints on the case by preventing any one institution from defining IP jurisprudence. Second, a roster system ensures against the possibility of the same judge sitting in appeal of cases. However, it is also pertinent to note that by the abolition of the IPAB, the three-tier mechanism of IPAB, Single Judge and Division Bench has been reduced to a two-tier system of Single Judge and Division Bench. Though the order attempts to trim the rough edges of uncertainty, by a literal reading of the IPD and the Delhi High Court Rules and surely clear the path for future cases while asserting the supremacy of its authority, it is still not immune from feeling the jitters of the ripple effects in the aftermath of the IPAB’s abolition. This is so because even after declaring the judicial supremacy over the IPAB and authority to hear the writ against the IPAB order, the order does not take into account the realistic anomaly whereby a writ challenging the IPAB order (which is the authority of first instance) passed in a revocation petition will lie before the Single Judge, whereas an appeal against the order of the Single Judge issued in a rectification will lie before the Division Bench.

A Glimpse at the Ribociclib Case Intellectual Rigour, Redefining Judicial Courage: Supreme Court Justice SR Bhat’s Rich Legacy Draft Patent Amendment Rules: Big Impact but Limited Commentary",
    "data": "On February 1, 2023 the Zero Draft of the WHO’s proposed Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response Accord was published by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body. Bringing us up to date with the key aspects of the accord and the current stage of negotiations, we are pleased to bring to you a guest post by SpicyIP intern Arnav Laroia. Arnav is a second-year law student at West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata. He is interested in understanding and advocating for the complexities of intellectual property law, with a focus on the intersection of innovation, legal frameworks, and creative expression within the modern landscape. Arnav LaroiaOne significant international effort aimed at promoting global agreement to enhance reaction and readiness in the face of pandemic threats is the Pandemic Preparedness Accord. Members of the World Health Organisation (WHO) have suggested an instrument (“convention, agreement or other international agreement”) that seeks to provide a framework for state-to-state cooperation and the advancement of a comprehensive plan in order to strengthen global readiness, allowing countries to be more resilient against future pandemics that incorporates all governmental branches and the general public in light of the recent COVID pandemic.The failures during the COVID pandemic were multifaceted, involving inadequate global coordination, underfunded health systems, and challenges in implementing measures effectively. Moreover, the failures of the WTO to serve as a unifying body for a response to the COVID pandemic have been well documented on the blog recently (for eg here). The International Health Regulations (IHR) were not fully utilised due to countries’ reluctance to comply, fear of economic repercussions, and the lack of enforcement mechanisms. Issues such as delayed information sharing, political tensions impacting collaboration, and prioritising national interests over global cooperation contributed to the failure to effectively implement the IHR, hampering a unified response. Therefore, the need for the Pandemic Accord arose due to the lack of comprehensive global response frameworks, urging a collective commitment to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future health crises, thereby filling the gaps in international cooperation and preparedness.The agreement’s main objectives are to improve national, regional, and global capacities, ensure that healthcare is accessible to everyone, and promote readiness for future pandemics. The process includes diplomatic talks between different countries with the goal of creating a major international agreement that ensures improved collaboration and preparedness in the event of any pandemics in the future. It is still unclear if the 194 WHO member nations will be able to reach a consensus on a pandemic accord that would have any real influence, given the difficult and sensitive subjects being discussed. Due to the ongoing slow progress in the negotiations between member countries, uncertainties have been raised regarding the conclusion of the negotiations by the 77th World Health Assembly in May 2024.The negotiations and foundation for the pandemic accord involved countries within the World Health Organisation (WHO). Nations like Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Namibia, and South Africa advocated for specific language such as “Common But Differentiated Responsibility” (CBDR), aiming to address the varying needs and responsibilities of different nations. Additionally, countries like Fiji played a role in these discussions, emphasizing different perspectives on the accord. Up until now, the six nations chosen to spearhead the process—South Africa, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil, Thailand, and Egypt (one from each region)—have used three separate draft documents from the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body Bureau (INB Bureau) as the foundation for the negotiations.On February 1, 2023, the zero draft of the accord was published by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, and negotiations began on March 3, 2023. Countries set out the way forward for continued negotiations on the global accord with meetings in June, September, and October 2023. The negotiation text proposal provided by the Bureau on October 16 will be discussed during the 7th meeting of the INB, which takes place on November 6–10 and December 4–6. It seems that the members want a review of the text prior to even acknowledging it as a text for negotiation in order to maintain their stance that the proposal for negotiation text would be without prejudice to the right of any member state to present textual proposals and to the status of the compilation document.Evidence of the urgent need to alter the global health security framework is the main area of attention. However, there are still significant differences on crucial issues. Benefit sharing and pathogens are two of them. When disease outbreaks occur, researchers may quickly find microorganisms, which enables the creation of medical countermeasures such as vaccinations as soon as feasible. The main issues regarding equity in pandemic accords revolve around the unequal distribution of resources, access to healthcare, and fair treatment during health emergencies like the COVID pandemic. Concerns have been raised about weakening equity clauses in the latest drafts of pandemic accords, possibly diminishing the focus on ensuring fairness and equal access to healthcare during global health emergencies.Some of the primary elements of the previous draft of the pandemic accord are still included in the most current proposal, including time-bound waivers of intellectual property (IP) rights and advantages for nations that exchange information on hazardous microorganisms. However, during discussions, these two topics have been the main points of disagreement. In order to manufacture pandemic-related goods “during a pandemic,” the draft asks the nations and regional organisations that will be bound by the agreement to commit to agree upon, within the framework of relevant institutions, time-bound waivers of intellectual property rights. Additionally, it encourages patent holders to temporarily waive or manage, as appropriate, payment royalties made by developing country manufacturers. According to the wording, people who have benefited from public financing for the creation of items connected to pandemics would need to comply “as appropriate.”Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical sector is adamantly against an IP waiver, claiming that by discouraging innovation, it would impede future pandemic responses. They have long maintained that the COVID-19 vaccination disparity was caused by trade and export restrictions. Furthermore, major Western countries have adopted a stance on the IP waiver that is somewhat comparable to this. A pandemic agreement with “major limitations” on intellectual property (IP) rights protection, according to German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, “will not fly” for Germany and the majority of its fellow European Union (EU) members, who also asserted that intellectual property security is necessary in order to invest in vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other related fields. Several of the biggest pharmaceutical corporations in the world are based in both Europe and the US, and they oppose significant changes to intellectual property rights under a pandemic accord. Another issue, mostly brought up by European countries, is the relinquishing of executive power to the accord. They argue that it needs to be made very clear that, in the event of a pandemic, all of the signatory nations’ full executive power will not be restricted or infringed upon and that the executive power will always remain within the nations where the action occurs.The WHO Member States are leading an international effort to improve global preparation and equality in responding to pandemics, known as the pandemic preparedness pact. This work is motivated by the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. With an eye towards a comprehensive and inclusive strategy for pandemic preparation and response, the INB was an important contributor in the writing and negotiation of this important agreement. Recent progress has shown that, despite the numerous informal and formal discussions surrounding the pandemic accord, agreement on issues such as the two main points of contention—time-bound waivers of intellectual property (IP) rights and equitable distribution—as well as advantages for nations that exchange information about potentially dangerous pathogens, is still (likely) a long way off.There are huge gaps between high- and low-income nations. High-income countries are reluctant to sign binding obligations to share lifesaving resources. But low-income countries demand that they have a right to fair and affordable access to vaccines and drugs. It is clear that rapid reporting, sharing pathogen samples and genomic sequence data, and sharing scientific and epidemiologic information are vital for global health. It is equally clear that a system where all the benefits go to high-income countries and lower-income countries are left behind cannot be tolerated. The below-stated suggestions are oriented towards addressing equity concerns and ensuring no one is left behind in the way the world deals with major health threats in the future. The recommendations focus on ensuring fair vaccine distribution, healthcare access, and resources, targeting underserved populations. These recommendations have been identified and compiled from various sources. These are as follows:"

    "data": "[This post has been authored by SpicyIP intern Rohan Srivastava. Rohan is a Second Year student at National Law School Of India University and has a keen interest in IPR and Technology Law.]The recent increase in COVID-19 cases in India comes as a Deja Vu, reminiscent of the predicament India and the world were in 2 years ago. While the spike should not be a cause of concern owing to a proper vaccination run (also see here for the number of doses administered), elsewhere, experts and delegates are still engaged in negotiations over a possible extension of the TRIPS waiver to medical supplies and pharmaceuticals products. The TRIPS waiver, which became a hot topic for debates around multilateralism from October 2020, brought to the forefront the international community’s inaction and paralysis in the face of a global crisis of unprecedented scale. The fact that the negotiations recently extended the deadline for deciding on the waiver, almost a year after the medical emergency was subdued, is itself a testament to how time taking and inefficient the waiver fiasco has ended up being. This post will seek to look back at the controversy surrounding the waiver and reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight. In doing so, this post shall uncover the handicaps in seeking the TRIPS waiver, both internally in the WTO decision-making process and problems with the idea of a waiver as a way out of the crisis. This piece will then conclude with certain considerations that must be kept in mind for the future.The Pandemic was not the first time that the WTO’s inefficient decision-making process came to the forefront. (For example- Trade Law enthusiasts will recall the painstakingly long Doha Round of Negotiations, which were the 9th round of negotiations and the first since the WTO was established.) Part of the reason behind the WTO’s inefficient decision-making is its consensus-based model. Consensus, at WTO, means the lack of sustained opposition i.e. a decision is made when no member formally objects to it. (In the context of the TRIPS waiver, the consensus-based decision-making model can be seen in Article IX: 3 (1) of the Marrakesh agreement r/w Footnote 1.)Thus, decision-making at the WTO requires lobbying each and every member of the Organization in support, which often ends up being a zero-sum game for the members. While there is certainly merit in having this consensus-based approach, insofar as it is more democratic and allows due consideration to be given to all viewpoints, the pandemic has clearly exposed that the same rationale may be turned on its head during a medical health emergency. Already, there has been a lot of global north and global south contention over the availability of essential medicines at the time of crisis. For instance, the HIV/AIDS crisis and the surrounding access to medicines issue that started off in 2001 and fructified into an amendment only in 2017 (see here). The same was reflected in the context of TRIPS COVID-19 Vaccine waiver as well, where first a broad waiver was proposed by the member countries (see here and here) and after the subsequently revised proposals (see here), the existing waiver, which applies only on vaccines, was accepted. These instances show how the consensus-based approach at the WTO, which can be argued to protect the interests of the less influential countries, can also work against them when decision-making is required to be made in emergencies where time is of the essence. This is especially significant since the developing countries have for long been in majority in the WTO but still have not had their say, for the self-interests of a handful of developed nations (read here and here). What is even more ironic is that despite the strong resistance by the developed nations in the negotiation process which led to further delays in reaching a conclusive and timely waiver, the ministerial council’s final decision did not even concern the developed nations as they were not eligible members as per the document. What is to be kept in mind is that it was ultimately the developing countries that had to face the brunt of being deprived of their IP Protection. (Find more on this here.) Looking at the October 2020 draft, proponents claimed that a waiver is necessary to ensure proper access because the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS such as compulsory licensing etc. are not feasible in an emergency such as the pandemic. However, proponent countries themselves actively refused from utilising already existing flexibilities first to reach the above assertion. For instance, the Indian Supreme Court even questioned the Indian government’s reluctance to utilise compulsory licensing provisions in domestic law on precisely this point, and yet there was no action on this front. (Read more on this here) The lack of an efficient internal decision-making process at the WTO and wide disagreements over the desirability of a waiver raises the question of whether it is the appropriate recourse at times of crisis or if the global community would do better to envisage alternative mechanisms in the future. The opponents of the waiver, who were mostly the developed nations housing the major pharmaceutical manufacturers, argued that the October 2020 waiver will take away the incentive to innovate the cure for the pandemic. They instead argued that the members should utilize the flexibilities incorporated within the TRIPS in order to cater to the rising need for essential commodities. Even the final ministerial decision was an iteration of the opponent’s sentiment only, in so far as it did not technically waive off any IPR protections under the TRIPS but instead clarified the existing flexibilities. Looking at the TRIPS agreement, one can see that it is cognizant of the need to balance such social imperatives with the protection of IPR, and has incorporated relevant structural features. For instance, Article 7 provides that the ‘protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare’ while Article 8 states that Members ‘may, in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health … provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of the Agreement’. The TRIPS agreement makes it clear that Members are free to pursue legitimate public policy objectives. Furthermore, despite claims to the contrary, TRIPS flexibilities, including mandatory licensure, pharmaceutical transition measures, parallel importation, and research exceptions, have all been used and successfully demonstrated. For instance, a study by Ellen t’Hoen et al on the use of TRIPS flexibilities found that 89 countries used TRIPS flexibilities 176 times between 2001 and 2016, with over half of those uses (79.5%) involving Compulsory license, public noncommercial use, and LDC pharmaceutical transition measure. Thus, one would not be wrong to think that a lot of crucial time wasted in the negotiations at the time of the crisis could have been saved, had the proponents focussed more on aggressively pursuing the existing options or seeking clarification regarding the same for greater certainty, especially given that this was what was eventually agreed to instead of having a blanket waiver. It is undoubtedly true that a global crisis of such a magnitude would require multilateral cooperation and collective initiatives, the question however is what could be achieved by a patent waiver when most LDC countries lack the required infrastructure capabilities to actually engage in vaccine manufacture. Looking at a chart of key vaccine developing countries (here) one can see that there are only a handful of developing countries with vaccine manufacturing prowess. Assuming the broader waiver proposal was accepted, the opponents (housing the majority of vaccine developers) could still have refused to apply the same in their countries, (this intent is evident from the outcome waiver document that expressly exempts the developed countries from the ambit of its application). And thus, the only benefit that would have occurred out of the broad waiver would have been the flexibility to not be sued for non-consensual use of the IP involved in the production of the vaccines, by the manufacturers located in these developing- broad waiver proponent countries. However, it is pertinent to note, that if the ultimate benefit of the waiver would have been the freedom from being sued for non-consensual use of the underlying IP, then as argued above, TRIPS already caters to it under Article 73 (b)(iii), and thus making the whole exercise largely a rut. It is also interesting to note that the developed countries which came to the table in favour of the TRIPS waiver in the name of multilateral cooperation for assuring equitable access to vaccines, were at the same time also doing lip service to their commitments by signing bulky procurement orders with multiple vaccine manufacturers to keep their eggs in several baskets. These orders were also often in excess of the vaccine requirement of the particular country, at a time when vaccine availability across the world was uncertain. The TRIPS negotiation allowed vaccine nationalism to maintain face at the international fora as is also evident from the final ministerial decision which limited the applicability to the developing countries and LDCs. (Refer here) It thus becomes evident that a TRIPS waiver cannot be seen as a ready response that will act as a panacea to the woes of vaccine availability during times of crisis. With regards to the internal process in the WTO, the pandemic has made it clear that WTO cannot be expected to make ad-hoc decisions due to the consensus requirements given that differing considerations, such as the impact on innovation etc. are involved in such a decision. The only hope on the IPR front would be for the WTO to create structural safeguards that can aid in times of such crisis and clarify such flexibilities. Given that the utility of a waiver itself is also under question, the WTO also needs to focus more on ensuring the availability of vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and treatment options by continuing its efforts to identify and reduce barriers to trade, to ensure that states which do not have the institutional capacity to make use of the waiver are not left out. One instance of such a barrier is regulatory bottlenecks which impeded the speedy dispersal of vaccines globally. (Read more on this here and here) In addition to this, there have also been criticisms against the TRIPS framework for being unable to protect the interest of developing nations and encouraging the growth of technology in the LDCs. So far, TRIPS has only ensured greater IP protection to technology-generating countries and there has been no trickle-down or transfer of technology from the higher-income countries to the LDCs, despite having provisions urging the same. It is imperative that WHO, which is better suited for responding to a global health crisis, steps up to the game for ensuring equitable access to vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other medical aid through multilateral cooperation. Much of the international cooperation in such efforts will also depend upon the fate of the global treaty for future pandemic emergencies under the WHO which is currently under negotiations. The main purpose of the initiative is to ensure early detection and prevention of future pandemics, including a stronger international health framework within the WHO that would attempt to ensure universal and equitable access to medical solutions. It is also pertinent to note that the treaty includes provisions for timely waiver of IP protection so that there is no tussle at the time of crisis and valuable time and lives are not wasted (Article 7.4). However, as if the international community refuses to learn, the negotiations are again facing institutional concerns and are being done in a non-transparent manner (See Talha Burki’s statement on this media coverage here). This can potentially undermine trust in the process and history might again repeat itself with another deadlock over the differences between the developed and developing nations and over the fate of countless lives.Multilateral cooperation at times of global emergencies like the pandemic is understandably hard to come by given the pressing needs each member state has internally. The COVID-19 pandemic cannot be seen as a one-off event and it is widely predicted that as man taps more with nature it is likely that there may be a rise in the frequency of pandemics. Thus, it would do well if the international community sees the entire TRIPS waiver fiasco as a lesson on how things pan out practically in times of crisis and is able to come up with more practical and efficient mechanisms which would allow all states to acquire an equitable supply of vaccines despite the socio-economic inequalities across the borders.

    "headline": "IP Rights, Access, and WHO’s Pandemic Accord Potential Loopholes in the Execution of Local Commission Rochem v. Nirtech – Analysing the Claim of Breach of Confidential Information An Obituary to the TRIPS ‘Waiver’: Lessons from an Imperfect Response",
    "data": "The Indian government has refused to disclose its collaboration agreements and investments made in developing and procuring India’s Covid 19 vaccine – Covaxin, the Indian mRNA and intranasal vaccine candidates.Despite widespread public interest in these arrangements, the government has consistently rejected Right to Information (RTI) applications requesting this information. (for the responses received from the CIC see here, here and here) Prashant Reddy (who needs no introduction on this blog) filed several RTI requests covering public-private partnership arrangements related to the Covid 19 vaccines. He has challenged the blanket refusal by the government before the Delhi High Court. He is represented by lawyers Swathi Sukumar and Sai Vinod (also a former SpicyIP blogger).Since 2021 the Indian public has been made aware of the existence of several public-private arrangements related to the development and procurement of Covid 19 vaccines. For instance, the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology, two government bodies, collaborated with Bharat Biotech to develop a Covid 19 vaccine – Covaxin. The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) also funded Gennova Pharmaceuticals and Bharat Biotech for their mRNA and intranasal vaccine candidates. Further, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare placed purchase orders for several vaccines.Since then, the Indian public has raised several questions regarding the details of these arrangements. Many articles (e.g. here and here) have questioned the lack of transparency, intellectual property rights concerns, and the lack of information about the amount of taxpayer money that has gone into these arrangements. It is clear that the public, whose money is being used, wants to know the details. More so because a substantial amount of public funds and resources have been expended in this regard. For context, more than 36 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered in India. However, the government has refused to provide information regarding these arrangements.In an attempt to characterise this issue as an intellectual property rights issue (rather than a governance issue), the government has cited an exemption under Section 8(d) of the RTI Act to withhold information. The categories of records exempt under Section 8(d) are ‘commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party.’ To be sure, this is not a blanket exemption. The competent authority can disclose even these categories of information if it is satisfied that ‘larger public interest warrants its disclosure’. Everything else aside, the arrangements in questions are not every day, ordinary arrangements. These arrangements relate to public authorities and a public purpose – developing vaccines to protect against Covid 19. Further, they arose out of and are inherently tied to a world-wide, deadly pandemic, an international health emergency, that the public is undoubtedly interested in. In fact, public disclosure of COVID-19 vaccine agreements is the global norm. The United States and the United Kingdom that collaborated with private companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines have released copies of their research and collaboration agreements under their Freedom of Information (FOI) laws with redactions. This by itself warrants disclosure and the government seems to have mischaracterised the issue at hand.Even otherwise, as argued in detail by Prashant in his petition, public-private agreements are subject to different treatment under the RTI Act. As per binding precedent, the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) is obligated to disclose public-private partnership agreements (Navroz Mody vs. Mumbai Port Trust). Further, government bodies like ICMR and BIRAC are obligated under law (Section 4 of the RTI Act) to publish information relating to public-private partnerships (PPPs) on the internet. In 2013, the Department of Personnel and Training issued guidelines which instructed public authorities to disclose “all information” relating to PPPs voluntarily including documents generated in the course of implementation of the PPPs, all payments made under PPPs along with the purpose of the payments. The government has also argued that since the contracts are on-going they should not be made to disclose them. But the petitioner has cited several cases where high courts have allowed disclosures even where contracts were ongoing or still in operation.As highlighted by the petitioner, instead of a blanket refusal, the concerned authority should have perused the documents in order to establish whether they contain any information relating to ‘trade secrets’ or ‘commercial confidence’ or ‘intellectual property’ – all terms that have specific meaning under law.It seems difficult to beat the law and the logic in the petition. Interestingly, the government seems to be flustered by the petitioner’s strong case and is resorting to cheap tactics – personally attacking him for ‘acting against the interest of the nation’ instead of fighting the matter on its merits."

    "data": "Battle lines are being drawn in the fight over the lucrative mRNA vaccine technology used in certain Covid 19 vaccines. Moderna recently sued Pfizer alleging patent infringement of three out of eight patents that cover its Covid 19 vaccine (Spikevax).Moderna has supplied over 299 million doses of its Covid 19 vaccine to the United States and has, reportedly, lined up supply deals worth USD 35 billion through the end of 2022.Pfizer and BioNTech have supplied over 472 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) for use in the United States. Pfizer recently announced that it expects an additional USD 32 billion in global revenues from Comirnaty.As reported, Moderna earned revenue of around USD 10 billion for its vaccine, and Pfizer earned around USD 22 billion, in just a year. Both companies have enjoyed windfall financial gain from the sale of their respective vaccines. The sales of these vaccines are likely to rank among the highest in a single year for any medical product in history.The sheer size of sales and revenue coupled with patent monopolies and the immense potential of the mRNA technology, makes both these entities King-like – rich, supreme and sometimes hypocritical.The tale of two kingsModernaStrikingly, the portrait that Moderna paints of itself is not one of a King but of a small, research-driven start-up in need of funding. Moderna’s patent infringement lawsuit is a revenue seeking activity since Moderna wants fair compensation but does not want to remove Comirnaty from the market.As claimed, fair compensation will allow it to invest in its leading mRNA platform. Moderna believes that this case will also ensure that next generation biotech startups don’t lose their ability to rely on the patent system.This David v. Goliath narrative is probably drawn up since Moderna has requested a jury trial. Some studies have shown that juries favour independent inventors / start-ups over bigger corporate defendants (e.g. Judge Kimberly Moore, Populism and Patents, NYU L.Rev).Moderna was set up in 2010 with its sole focus being mRNA technology. Moderna claims to be at the forefront of this technology having begun its research before the pandemic and before anyone had figured out how to make or use mRNA medicines successfully. And along the way it encountered several technical challenges which it successfully overcame.Moderna’s Spikevax is covered by eight patents, three of which have allegedly been infringed by Pfizer and BioNTech. The three patents cover novels ways through which Moderna stabilized the mRNA by modifying its chemical structure (to reduce immune response against mRNA itself); identified ways to optimise its mRNA platform; and developed new techniques for manufacturing on a large scale.These efforts include – replacing uridine in the mRNA molecule with 1-methylpseudouridine to reduce immune response against mRNA itself; and discovering that encoding a full-length coronavirus spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation was highly effective at producing neutralizing antibodies to the coronavirus.Due to its focus on mRNA technology and research in this field, once the genomic sequence for SAR-CoV-2 was published, Moderna was able to produce its vaccine at a lightning-fast pace. Moderna had six mRNA candidates for infectious diseases in clinical trials by the time COVID-19 arrived.However, it must be kept in mind that Moderna was able to get the vaccine out so fast because of several other factors. As disclosed by KEI and The Intercept, the US government gave companies special authority to use another person’s technology, without permission, to produce Covid 19 vaccines. Moderna was one such company that was granted a compulsory license. Such relaxations were specifically aimed at speeding up the process of vaccine production. Easy for Moderna to now push for ‘licensing and not abrogating patents’. This issue is the center of controversy in two lawsuits filed against Moderna by Arbutus Biopharma Corp. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. over the use of lipid nanoparticle technology in the mRNA vaccines.Its partnership with the NIH is also alluded to. However, patent ownership controversy with the NIH is a separate story (here and here).Pfizer and BioNTechUnlike Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech started with as many as 20 vaccine candidates representing different mRNA constructs. Moderna claims that not all 20 infringed its patents but ultimately Pfizer and BioNTech decided to go ahead with the one that uses Moderna’s patented technology i.e. uses the same 1-methylpseudouridine chemical modification in a lipid nanoparticle formulation and contains mRNA encoding for the same full-length spike protein for SARS-CoV-2.It appears that BioNTech (another start-up founded by Dr. Sahin and Dr. Tureci) was focused on cancer treatments prior to the pandemic but was also looking into mRNA for cancer treatment.Further, Katalin Karikó whose scientific research has been acknowledged as foundational in RNA mediated immune activation research is associated with BioNTech. Together with Drew Weissman, she holds U.S. patents for the application of non-immunogenic, nucleoside-modified RNA.As reported, these patents have been licensed to both Moderna and BioNTech. BioNTech entered into a partnership with 173 year old Pfizer to commercialise its mRNA technology.Pfize and BioNTech also have patent infringement cases filed against them for their vaccine e.g. by CureVac, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Allele Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals.The world their battlefieldWhile this patent battle is technically being fought in court rooms in Cambridge, MA and Düsseldorf, Germany, it could have worldwide implications.Moderna has pledged (again but this time it appears to be a pledge forever) never to “enforce patents for COVID-19 vaccines against companies manufacturing in or for the 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), provided that the manufactured vaccines are solely for use in the AMC 92 countries.” This pledge becomes relevant for initiatives such as the WHO’s mRNA tech-transfer hub in South Africa. It appears that WHO asked Moderna and Pfizer and BioNTech to help teach researchers in low-and middle-income countries how to make their COVID-19 vaccines. However, neither of the companies responded so the WHO decided to go ahead anyway and replicated Moderna’s vaccine (relying on its older pledge). See here for implications on reneging on pledges in the patent context.Added to this, the fact remains that mRNA vaccine technology is a new era in vaccine science, one with immense potential even beyond Covid 19. Due to its effectiveness, potential for low-cost manufacturing, capacity for speedy development and safe administration, mRNA vaccines have been prophesied to be a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches. The facility to make mRNA can also be used for vaccines for different diseases making manufacturing flexible. See here for a brief overview of the science behind mRNA vaccines.The surest and easiest way for countries and companies to access this technology is to obtain a license from the technology owner. However, as is evident, ownership over this technology and its component parts is extremely fuzzy.When ownership is itself in dispute, the process of obtaining a license from either entity becomes a risky and expensive exercise.Some argue that neither Moderna nor BioNTech-Pfizer nor Curevac and others who are litigating this tech own the technology – it belongs to the world and is in public domain (here). Others argue that some of Moderna’s patent claims are over-broad and may be weakened due to prior art.Given the potential of this technology, it is hoped that this battle gets over sooner rather than later. Some suggest that a simplified inter partes review (before the USPTO rather than courts) is all that it would take which could result in a quick decision. However, given that this is a sport of kings, history shows that when billion-dollar biomedical inventions are involved, disputes drag on in courts for years.Thank you to Swaraj for his inputs!"

Nirtech – Analysing the Claim of Breach of Confidential Information",
    "data": "IP lawyers would agree that local commission plays an extremely important role in IP litigation by assisting the court in securing evidence against the allegation of infringement. Highlighting potential vulnerabilities in executing a local commission and discussing the solutions to overcome them, we are pleased to bring to you a co-authored post by Rohit Pradhan and Brahmakrit Rao Gadela. Rohit is an IPR litigator working as an Associate at LitLegal, practising before Hon’ble Delhi High Court and Districts Court in Delhi NCR. Brahmakrit is a Law Clerk cum Research Associate for Justice Hima Kohli, Supreme Court of India. They are also co-authors of the book ‘Franchise Laws in India’. Views expressed here are those of the authors’ alone. Rohit Pradhan and Brahmakrit Rao GadelaThe authors, through this post, raise concerns regarding the appointment and execution of the Local Commission. The authors address specific challenges inherent in the appointment of Local Commissioner (LC) and execution of Local Commissions within the context of Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) litigation. We identify vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could render the objectives of these commissions ineffective. The post further discusses instances where the confidentiality of commission proceedings may be compromised, thereby jeopardizing their intended purpose. Practical solutions to mitigate these challenges are also proposed.Particularly in cases involving infringement or passing off, the plaintiff typically files an application under Order XXVI Rule 9 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) to seek the appointment of a LC. Once this application is allowed and LC is appointed (wherein the Plaintiff is directed to pay a substantial fees to the LC), aims to ensure that evidence is collected in an impartial manner. It is the plaintiff who incurs the costs associated with appointing a LC, which can range from INR 1-2 lakhs for a single day (para. 25), especially within the jurisdiction of Delhi. Once appointed, the LC becomes a critical component of the legal process, serving as an essential instrument for gathering evidence crucial to the case.The LC is a neutral person appointed by the court. Their primary role is to execute the local commission at the designated location (usually it’s Defendant’s place of business). It is tasked with the identification and collection of evidence. This could either involve seizing the evidence or merely inventorying it. If the latter is chosen, the evidence is then handed over to the defendant with a strict stipulation that it should not be disposed of until the court delivers its verdict. This process is instrumental in ensuring that justice is served in the case, since in both the cases i.e., seizing and inventorying (superdari), the evidence is preserved, which helps the court to adjudicate on the said matters properly. Once the LC completes its task, it prepares a detailed LC report. This report chronicles every step taken during the local commission, providing the court with an in-depth insight, which is crucial for adjudication. The core issue centers around the unauthorized disclosure of information pertaining to the appointment of LCs in IPR suits, particularly those involving infringement and passing off. Such premature leaks compromise the integrity of the legal process by providing an opportunity for defendants to conceal or tamper with evidence, thereby defeating the purpose of the LC’s operation. While there are no publicly documented cases highlighting this specific issue, it is an acknowledged concern among lawyers practicing in the field of IP litigation.(Sidenote: It is worth noting that the IPD bench, currently presided over by Hon’ble Mr. Justice C. Hari Shankar and Hon’ble Ms. Justice Prathiba M Singh, has begun adopting proactive measures to mitigate this issue. The bench has started to mute microphones during virtual hearings at the moment of passing an order for the appointment of a Local Commissioner. This subtle yet significant change in procedure indirectly reflects that the Bench is aware of the mishap pertaining to leakage of information).The absence of reported incidents may be attributed to the fact that most IP cases tend to settle out of court, which further underscores the urgency of addressing this persistent issue. Owing to such leaks there may be instances where the defendant may dispose of the evidence and after the execution of Local Commission presents a compliant face, offering to abide by the court’s order in the subsequent hearing. As a result, the plaintiff, despite having the law on their side, is often left at a disadvantage, losing not only time and resources but also the very objective for which the suit was filed in the first place. If these matters were consistently reported and pursued in court, the judiciary might take cognizance of the issue. The lack of reported incidents inadvertently shields the problem, making it all the more crucial to address this loophole.1. Dispatching the Orders: In the process of dispatching orders regarding appointment of the LC(s) and execution of the local commission, three copies are usually sent to the registry. One is intended for the Station House Officer (SHO) to provide police support, another for the Local Commissioner, and the last for the counsel representing the plaintiff for the purpose of execution of Local Commission. It’s worth noting that the court typically issues directions specifying the confidential nature of these orders. For instance, the court often instructs that such orders are not to be uploaded onto the court’s website until the commission has been executed and a report filed by the LC. The specific directive may read as follows:-“Let the copy of this order be not uploaded on the website of this Court till commission is executed and a report in that regard is filed by the learned Local Commissioner.”Despite the critical nature of these orders, there are chances that these orders can be leaked from/ by any of the parties involved, including the court’s registry.2. Open Court Proceedings: Whether the proceedings are in-person or virtual, they are open to all. This unfettered access allows individuals to glean sensitive details, such as the identity of the defendant, the location targeted, the products in contention, and more. This nullifies the surprise factor which the LC heavily relies on. It is pertinent to note that Section 153B of the CPC, states that the Civil Court is deemed to be an Open Court. The provision under this Section conveys that if the presiding Judge thinks fit, he may order at any stage of trial to restrict the access to the open Court. Thus it is suggested that the presiding Judge may hear and restrict the access of the cases wherein application for exemption from advance service and application for appointment of LC has been made. Furthermore, since, the suits which are filed has in its Master Index and Index-II mentioned the Applications which are being filed along with the suit, it becomes efficient for the Registry to segregate such cases, which could be listed on priority and sequentially. Pursuant to Section 129 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, and Section 7 of the Delhi High Court Act, 1966, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court is vested with the authority to issue appropriate directions concerning the practice and procedure to be followed in the exercise of its ordinary original civil jurisdiction. These legal provisions empower the court to implement measures that can enhance the efficacy and confidentiality of processes such as the appointment and execution of Local Commissioners.It is however, pertinent to note that, the suggestion no. 2 might seem to come in conflict with the ruling of Microlube India judgment, which suggested to highlight the main contesting party in the suit. The judgement sought to curb the trend wherein the main defendant used to get arrayed as Defendant No. 2 and 3 for the sole purpose to not let the defendant know if the matter has been listed in the Court. However, the same judgment did not take into consideration the issue of leakage of information pertaining to the Local Commission. Nonetheless, the main defendant could still be arrayed as the main defendant and on the first date of hearing, when and if the name of Defendant is redacted, the Hon’ble Court may hear the application for exemption of Advance Service u/s 151 CPC and in case if the same is not allowed, the next effective hearing could be done without redacting the name of the Defendant. This way it could be ensured that the aforementioned suggestion does not come in the way of the above-mentioned judgment.The Local Commission’s role is paramount, and ensuring its integrity is of the utmost importance. By addressing the highlighted loopholes and implementing the suggested remedies, we can reinforce the efficacy of the LC in such suits. We hope that the concerned authorities will consider these recommendations and take steps to uphold the sanctity of the legal process."

    "data": "[This post is authored by SpicyIP Intern Tejaswini Kaushal with inputs and comments from Swaraj and Praharsh. Tejaswini is a 3rd-year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow. She is keenly interested in Intellectual Property Law, Technology Law, and Corporate Law].Recently, the Print reported that Novartis and Eli Lilly have voiced their opposition to the idea of compulsory licensing (“CL”) for breast cancer medications, Ribociclib and Abemaciclib. In an affidavit filed before the Kerala High Court in the ongoing hearings pertaining to the availability of the drug (XXX v. Union of India) (previously discussed on the blog here and here) these pharmaceutical giants have argued that their sales have remained strong despite the pricing of these drugs in response to an ongoing hearing before the Kerala High Court. The petition seeks CLs for their HER2-negative breast cancer drugs, a move that would enable the production of more affordable generic versions. While attending the recent TWN webinar titled “Breaking Patent Barriers: Struggle to Access Breast Cancer Medicines in India” (notification here), on the background and implications of the case XXX v. Union of India, several thoughts and questions arose in my mind, and I will try to lay them out in this post. In particular, the post analyzes whether the argument for granting a CL in India is realistically the solution for this problem and highlights why there is a need for a more pragmatic approach towards this crisis.The plaintiffs who were a couple with a monthly pension of INR 74,400. In July 2021, the wife was diagnosed with metastatic HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer, for which she was prescribed Ribociclib (INR 58,140 per month), Letrozole (INR 1027.75 per month), and Zoledronic Acid (INR 4,313 per month). Additionally, she incurred INR 5,000 in expenses related to cardiac issues, which totaled their monthly expenditure to INR 68,480. In January 2022, she appealed for government support for affordable drug production. By June 2022, she filed a case in Kerala’s High Court but passed away in September 2022. The court took suo motu action and began inquiry about other drugs like Eli Lilly’s Abemaciclib and appointed Maitreyi Sachidananda Hegde as an amicus curiae. These affidavits were filed consequent to the March 2023 order where the court made Novartis and Eli Lilly parties to the present matter, and the relief sought included free treatment, local drug production, and access to breast cancer data, alongside a grant of CL under Sections 92 or 100 of the Indian Patent Act, 1970. While the government refused to grant a CL on the grounds that breast cancer is not a matter of ‘national’ or ‘extreme’ urgency, it acknowledged the effectiveness of Ribociclib for breast cancer treatment, and thus the present post will take into considerations the relevant figures pertaining to Ribociclib. Presently it is protected via a Patent ( No. 283133, Application No. 9406/DELNP/2008), titled “Pyrrolopyrimidine Compounds and Their Uses”). The term of the patent is set to expire in 2027. The matter of CL grant remains a pivotal matter of discussion since these drugs remain costly. An interesting pricing strategy that is being followed is that patients bear all expenses for the first nine months before potential free support from pharmaceutical companies, as Mr. Gopa Kumar (Senior Researcher and Legal Advisor, Third World Network) asserted during the aforementioned webinar.One crucial aspect of this analysis revolves around the Form 27 disclosures made by the company for the drug, which goes by the brand name Kryxana. However, before we get to the specific filings, it is pertinent to note that there is a potential difference in how “value” and “cost” are being interpreted in the Form. This contention has been previously detailed here, and this case shows how this difference in interpretation can lead to some serious discrepancies in understanding how exactly the patent has been ‘worked.’ In the July 2022 order, a month’s supply of a Ribociclib was said to cost INR 58,140. Novartis stated that the recommended dose of Ribociclib is 600 mg (3 x 200 mg film-coated tablets) taken orally once daily for 21 consecutive days, followed by 7 days off treatment. As previously discussed here, an online search verified that a strip with 21 tablets of 200 grams each was priced at INR 20,700, implying a monthly drug cost of INR 62,100 for 63 pills, closely matching the mentioned amount in the court’s order.However, it isn’t quite clear how and if the Form 27 disclosures tell the same story. The 2017-18 Form says that the patent was not worked in that year. (The patent was granted on May 5, 2017.) The 2018-19 Form reports quantum (No of units) as 8299, and value at INR 127,009,834, and only states that the working was done through importation from Switzerland. It also says that no licenses were given out. If we look solely at the quantum, it’s unclear whether these are 8299 ‘strips’ of 200mg tablets, or 8299 units of 200mg tablets. If we assume the latter, and also if we assume a patient needs 63 tablets per month, for 12 months in the year, then 8299 tablets only account for ~11 patients. If we assume the former (with 21 tablets in a strip and a patient consumes 3 strips per month), then this accounts for 231 patients. Neither is a very impressive number. The 2019-20 Form mentions 24,859 units with a value of INR 371,838,664. Here, if we assume 24,859 tablets of 200mg, then this serves approximately (24,859/63/12) = 33 patients. If we assume 24,859 strips of the tablet, then this serves approximately 693 patients. The 2020-21 Form format was changed by the 2020 patent rules. Nonetheless, Novartis filled it in the same manner. Quantum 38,910 units, and value of INR 489,466,100. If the quantum is for no. of tablets, then that serves ~51 patients. If the quantum is for the no. of strips, then that serves 1071 patients. The 2021-22 Form mentions 57,254 units with a value of INR 648,947,385. If the quantum is for no. of tablets, then that serves ~ 76 patients. If the quantum is for the no. of strips, then it serves 1507 patients.The 2022-23 Form mentions 94,189 units with a value of INR 886,157,495. If the quantum is for no. of tablets then that serves ~ 125 patients. If the quantum is for the no. of strips, then it serves 2616 patients. Needless to mention, without any disclosure of the method of ‘working’ (ie, regular sales, free samples, patient assistance programmes, etc), the “values” don’t give us much useful information. However, clearly the quantum of worked items is much lower than the 2,38,908 number of afflicted patients in the country. (Gentle reminder here, that there are now proposals to ensure that even these worked numbers are not required to be disclosed).This raises the question as to what is considered fulfilling the reasonable requirements of the public. The Indian Patent Act does permit the government to intervene and sideline patent exclusivities in a time of need. Looking at the relevant provisions on the patent levers (discussed in detail below) one can see that the power to exercise such levers is discretion subject to fulfillment of the relevant requisites. One mechanism for granting a CL is under Section 84 of the Indian Patent Act, 1970. This mechanism allows the government to grant licenses for producing affordable generic medicines if any of the following grounds are fulfilled:The first condition technically does not default since the patent has been worked in India since 2018 (as reflected in the above-discussed Form 27s). Though, clearly, it is not being worked anywhere close to the requirement of the drug. Moving on, the questions of reasonably affordable prices and reasonable requirements of the public are not as black and white. While the high cost of the drug is worrisome, as argued by Mathews here, the price of Rs. 58,140 per dose, by itself, doesn’t automatically indicate unreasonableness. It can be argued that several factors including production costs and research and development expenses must be considered while considering whether a drug is priced resonably or not. However, to understand this the focus should be on what is affordable for an Indian patient. As reported by Print, the companies have claimed relatively lower prices compared to elsewhere in the world (for instance, approximately $6,064-$15,162 per month in the United States (INR 505,281.89 – 1263,371.38 with the exchange rate as of 09 October 2023) and witnessing of increasing sales, thus suggesting there are no issues with the accessibility of the drug. However, a relook at the average income of an Indian citizen combined with low average savings, as highlighted in the previous section, is warranted here. It becomes difficult for the average Indian citizen to be able to afford this drug even at this supposedly low price.Moving on to the third ground regarding reasonable requirements being fulfilled. In its affidavit Noravtis revealed that Ribociclib sales in India have shown significant growth. In 2018, the drug generated Rs 12.7 crore in revenue from 8,000 units sold, its first year on the market. Subsequently, sales increased each year: reaching Rs 37.18 crore with 24,859 units in 2019, Rs 48.15 crore with 33,191 units in 2020, Rs 59.90 crore with 39,968 units in 2021, and finally, Rs 83.67 crore with 53,061 units in 2022. The affidavit also stated that the drug benefited approximately:2018: 267 patients2019: 829 patients2020: 1,106 patients2021: 1,332 patients2022: 1,769 patients(As can be seen these slightly vary from our calculations as taken from their Form 27 demonstrated earlier). As there is no publically available data on the number of patients suffering from HR+/HER2- Breast Cancer (as pointed out above), it seems impossible to say if the “reasonable requirements” of the public are fulfilled. It is also currently unclear how many patients there are who can afford but don’t have access to the drugs because of how few drugs are imported, and how many patients can’t afford the drug at that price, regardless. Though in a country like India, it can probably be safely assumed that there are a significant number in the latter category. As discussed previously, there is one company, MSN, listed as a local manufacturer for Ribociclib. However, a closer examination of the Form 27s reveals that all production still relies on imports, creating some ambiguity surrounding the current situation. Additionally, there is no clear information available regarding whether MSN has pursued a voluntary license for manufacturing. Provided that Section 84 specifically provides that only a generic pharmaceutical company has the locus standi to make (and subsequently fail) to obtain a voluntary license to trigger the applicability of the remaining portions (See Section 84(6)(ii) and (iii)). This requirement serves as a crucial trigger for the subsequent applicability of the provision, which fails here, rendering the provision somewhat redundant regardless of its applicability for Ribociclib.It was also claimed that Palbociclib, a similar medication, is available at an affordable price. However, patients often do not have the choice to switch to generic alternatives as their treatment is prescribed based on medical necessity (for more on this, see here). Surely with the expiration of Pfizer’s patent for Palbociclib in India would have made generics available at a fraction of the cost. However, the patients are forced to bear the high costs of non-generic medications (like Ribociclib) if that’s what has been prescribed. Another factor of importance is that Ribociclib and Palbociclib are not perfect substitutes for each other. In various deterministic sensitivity analyses, Ribociclib outperformed Palbociclib in terms life-years gained and quality-adjusted life-years gained.Another remedy provided by the Indian Patent Act is under Section 92 where the Central Government can grant a CL suo moto in cases of national emergency, extreme urgency, or public non-commercial use. While an effort for this was made and subsequently turned down by the Indian government, with the reason that its not a matter of “extreme” or “national” urgency. The question then arises, what are the criteria to determine “extreme” or “national” urgency? Unfortunately, the law is silent on this and does not specify when exactly will any urgency be a “national” or an “extreme” one. Apart from these two levers, there are two more (albeit a little radical) safeguards within the Patents Act. First, under Section 100 whereby the government is empowered to authorize companies to use the patented invention for “the purposes of government” and make them available in the market in a non commercial basis and ; Second, under Section 102 read with Section 47 (4) whereby the government can acquire the patent and make the drugs available via state run hospital/ pharmacies. But realistically speaking, it seems like a distant dream that the government will resort to these remedies. Speaking about the chances of the government issuing such licenses or taking expropriatory measures like under Section 100- we have seen in the past how threats of unilateral sanctions like Special 301 Report, influence the policy on resorting to such measures. Plus, given that India is already negotiating bilateral trade agreement with developed counterparts like the UK and the EU, issuing such an order may have some serious repercussions there. Even if (hypothetically speaking) the government takes up such measures, then too there isn’t any surety that the road ahead will be seamless. First, there still exists a question on whether the court can direct the executive to issue a compulsory license? (though earlier this idea was explored before the Supreme Court with regard to Remdesivir, Tocilizumab and other drugs, no conclusive finding was issued by the court on these points.) Second, despite being able to access the disclosure made before the Patent Office, there still exists a huge know-how gap against which no safeguard has been prescribed under any law and thus, any generic manufacturer manufacturing the drug using this compulsory license, would still have to overcome this know-how challenge. Furthermore, as evident from the ongoing litigation over Trastuzumab in the Delhi High Court, chances are the patentees may approach the court against such a move, not under Patent Act but rather challenging the approval granted by the drug regulator and may seek a stay, alleging “extended passing off”. All of this brings us back to square one and forces us to perhaps agree that Compulsory License is not the be all and end all solution to this problem of shortage of life savings drugs and rather its high time that the issue inaccessibility to essential life savings drugs be approached from a more holistic and pragmatic sense.

    "data": "[This post has been co-authored with Swaraj Paul Barooah].Putting an end to a 24 year old patent infringement suit, the Delhi High Court has directed Maharaja Appliances Ltd. (the defendant) to pay upwards of 81 lakhs (INR 81,44,925 to be precise) as damages to Strix Ltd. The decision is important on three counts- First, it is perhaps one of the rare decisions where the court has computed notional damage on a “reasonable royalty basis”; Second, it is one of the few patent cases where a decree has been issued by the court after an interim injunction; Third, it acts as the proverbial stick for the defendants who abandon the litigation midway to avoid producing its accounts. The dispute started off as a heated battle between the parties over the plaintiff’s ‘Liquid Heating Vessels’ patent, which the plaintiff claimed was used by the defendant in its electric kettles. The plaintiff alleged infringement over this while the defendant challenged the patent’s validity for lacking novelty and being obvious. Additionally, the defendant claimed that the plaintiff’s patent was not worked in India; even while acknowledging that it had earlier been purchasing heating vessels by the plaintiff directly! As a further twist, the defendants stated that they changed suppliers after facing some quality issues and switched to an unnamed Chinese supplier, who the defendant claimed had their own patent on the imported vessel. An interim injunction was granted to the plaintiff in 2009 and through the present judgement, the court decreed the suit in favour of the plaintiff.Before getting into the damages calculation – a quick overview of the issues brought up. On the suit patent lacking novelty and obviousness, there were three prior art documents put forward. Two of them were set aside as they were dated after the priority date of the suit patent. Regarding the third prior art document (EP0469758), the court held that though the result of the invention cited in the third prior art document and the suit patent is the same i.e. cutting of the heating of the vessels, the mechanism adopted by the inventions are different. Regarding non-working, the court pointed to the defendant’s purchase of the products from the plaintiff to hold that the plaintiff commercially exploited its patent by marketing them in India and thus held that the defendant was unable to establish the invalidity of the suit patent. Unfortunately, it appears the Form 27 for those years are not available online, so we haven’t been able to independently check any figures on this.On infringement, the court relied on Sotefin SA v. Indraprastha Cancer Society and Research Centre stating that to establish infringement, all that is required is to compare the granted claims of the suit patent with the defendant’s product. Doing so, the court held that the defendant’s product contains all the features claimed in the plaintiff’s suit patent.On the importation by the third party (Chinese supplier), the court held that though the defendant was trying to rely on the principle of exhaustion, it had neither produced any patent nor details of its Chinese supplier. It also turns out that the plaintiff’s corresponding patent has been enforced in China against certain third parties! And thus the court labeled the defendant’s claim as a red herring.A legal notice had been issued to the defendant on September 27, 2007 and this was subsequently followed by an interim injunction on September 10, 2009. This was used by the court to issue a retrospective finding that the defendant had been selling the infringing products “openly and intensively” for a period of two years between 2007 to 2009. There were no witnesses produced by the defendant even after filing its evidence by way of an affidavit, which was recorded by the Joint Registrar in 2012, and thereafter the defendant had stayed away from the proceedings. The court took this to mean it was avoiding producing its accounts before the court. Reprimanding this practice, the court first relied on Inter Ikea Systems BV & Ors. v. Imtiaz Ahamed to hold that a party who chooses not to participate in a court proceeding, cannot enjoy the benefits of such conduct. And then on Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. v. Rajesh Bansal and Ors. and Rule 20 of the IPD Rules (Page 15) to hold that factors like sales made by the defendant, royalty which the defendant would have to pay etc. can be used to calculate damages. Lastly, the court relied on Gerber Garment Technology Inc. v Lectra Systems Ltd. to hold that when a patentee cannot prove the loss then the same can be allotted on a reasonable royalty basis. This is akin to notional damages, where the court recognises that harm has been done, but due to lack of evidence from the defendant, is unable to know the exact amount. To check this, the court looked at the following information:-Defendant’s Kettle cost: INR 1400 (as per an invoice produced by the plaintiff)Patented heating vessel system: INR 270 (as per the plaintiff)Defendant’s Turnover (2007): 180 crores (as per a press clipping earlier placed on record by the defendant)Types of products the Defendant is selling: 18 (as per defendant’s website)As per this information, the court concluded that there was approximately 10 crores of revenue per product category. Then, “ …, considering that kettles may not be one of the most expensive product categories, the annual sales of kettles are taken at Rs.5 Crores and divided into the two models of kettles sold by the Defendant.”. Using this basis for 2 years (2007-09), it arrived at a total amount of INR 5 crores of the kettle (with the suit patent) sold. Dividing 5 crores by (INR) 1400, they arrived at 35,700 units of the kettle being sold, with total unaccounted patent costs being 35700x (INR) 270 = INR 96,39,000, with the court writing it as “at least 96,00,000 as profits”. (presumably Nevertheless, acknowledging that this was only a broad estimate, the court then proceeded to award INR 50,00,000 as damages in favour of the plaintiff. In addition to this, following the 2021 Supreme Court order in Uflex Ltd. v. Government of Tamil Nadu & Ors, the court awarded actual costs in pursuing the suit for 15 years as well. This amounted to INR 31,44,925, thus bringing the total amount to an outstanding INR 81,44,925 towards the plaintiff! The order also stated that they are to pay up within the next 3 months failing which the plaintiff would be entitled to recover the amount along with 7 percent simple interest!This case highlights the issue of parties seriously contesting their claims in IP litigation only till an injunction is granted by the court and abandoning the trial thereafter. While this seems to have happened in trademark law disputes (eg: Starbucks Corporation vs Teaquila A Fashion Cafe & Anr), this seems to be one of the rare (maybe our readers know other examples?) patent law disputes where the court has calculated notional damages on the basis of publicly available information."

Discussing his lasting legacy, Prashant Reddy highlights some of the features that set him and his tenure as a judge apart. This article was first published in Scroll.inDark Patterns Unmasked: Examining Their Influence on Digital Platforms and User BehaviourRecently, the Ministry of Consumers Affairs released the Draft Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns 2023. But what are these dark patterns and how do they interact with different IPRs? Touching upon these crucial questions, Srijaa G. and Yaggya Kapoor write about the menace of dark patterns and discuss some notable examples of regulatory interventions.Smithkline Beecham Limited vs Maxivision Eye Hospitals Private Ltd on 20 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)Delhi High Court passed an ad interim injunction against the defendant for using the plaintiff’s GSK mark. The court held that the defendant’s use of the impugned mark fulfills the test of triple identity (identical marks, trade channels and consumers) and its adoption of the mark is clearly dishonest and malafide.Ustad Faiyaz Wasifuddin Dagar vs Mr. A.R. Rahman & Ors on 20 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court) The plaintiff, a descendant of the family lineage of Dhrupad vocalists, has filed a suit against the music director, director and producer of the cinematographic film Ponniyin Selvan – 2 for infringing copyright in “Shiva Stuti” composed in Adana Raag. The plaintiff alleged that though the lyrics are different, the taal and beats of the impugned song “Veera Raj Veera” are identical to the subject work. The court heard the two competing works and in order to consider the request for interim relief, it directed the defendants to produce the raw recording of the song “Veera Raj Veera.” Wow Momo Foods Private Limited vs Franchisebyte on 20 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff alleged that the defendants are defrauding innocent people by luring them to apply for franchise of plaintiff’s business when no such franchises are extended by them, and in doing so the defendant is wrongfully using the plaintiff’s “Wow Momo” mark. Considering the above, the court passed an ex-parte ad interim injunction order, restricting the defendants from using the plaintiff’s mark, and directed them to disclose the details of persons to whom purported franchises have been offered.Puma Se vs Ashok Kumar on 20 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court decreed the suit in the favor of the plaintiff, restricting the defendant from using “Puma” mark of the plaintiff. Considering that the defendant did not appear in the proceedings, the court imposed damages to the tune of INR 10 Lakhs and costs of INR 2 lakhs on the defendant.Strix Ltd vs Maharaja Appliances Limited on 20 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court decreed the suit in favor of the plaintiff, restricting the defendants from infringing its ‘liquid heating vessels’ patent. Considering that the defendants stopped appearing in the proceedings for a long time, the court calculated notional damages on a “reasonable royalty basis” relying on publicly available information and imposed damages worth 50 lakhs on the defendant. Additionally, the court further imposed costs worth INR 31, 44, 925/- on the defendants."

    "data": "On September 7, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs published the Draft Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns 2023, inviting comments from the public. Though the deadline for sharing these comments passed on October 5 and the government is presently working on finalizing the Rules, we received a guest post underlining the need to regulate the menace caused by dark patterns and its interaction with intellectual property rights. On this note, we are pleased to bring to you this guest post on dark patterns by Srijaa Grover and Yaggya Kapoor. Srijaa is a 4th year law student and Yaggya is a 5th year law student at Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies, interested in exploring the vast scope of Intellectual Property Rights. Srijaa Grover and Yaggya KapoorHarry Brignull introduced the concept of “dark patterns” in 2010, describing them as deceptive tactics aimed at boosting conversion rates. These unethical UI/UX interactions mislead users to perform actions they don’t want, benefiting the company or platform. Dark patterns can take away users’ right to full information about their services and control over their browsing experience, affecting their overall experience.The Department of Consumer Affairs (DoCA) recently provided “Draft Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns 2023.” The Centre previously sought comments on the guidelines for preventing and regulating “dark patterns” on the internet, especially in e-commerce platforms and subsequently issued a press release stating that they are going through them and will come up with the final guidelines soon.The DoCA had illustrated 10 practices as dark patterns. They are:1. False urgency is a marketing tactic that creates a false sense of scarcity to pressure consumers into making a purchase, often resulting in dark patterns, limited stock, and unexpected delivery.2. Basket sneaking is when additional products or services are added to a shopping cart without the consumer explicitly adding them at the checkout page. Example- Donations to a charity or ancillary products. 3. Subscription trap is a strategy where a service or subscription is made easy to sign up for but difficult to unsubscribe. Example: When opt-out/ unsubscribing services are hidden or require multiple steps to arrive at the cancellation page. 4. Confirm shaming is the act of causing consumers to choose products or services they wouldn’t otherwise. These are often found in the notifications ‘unsubscribe’ section. Example: ‘No thanks, I hate saving money’5. Forced action is when a company forces consumers to take an action they wouldn’t otherwise, such as signing up for ancillary services or products.6. Nagging refers to persistent, repetitive, and constant requests for action, such as the ‘sign-up’ or ‘subscribe now’ box repeatedly opening on an unrelated webpage during various access steps.7. Interface interference is a tactic that hinders consumers from performing actions like cancelling subscriptions or deleting accounts, such as redirecting them to another page while trying to cancel a pop-up advertisement.8. Bait and switch is the practice of presenting consumers with high-quality advertisements, but delivering a lower-quality product instead, often due to contrasting images or descriptions.9. Hidden costs are additional fees added during checkout, such as convenience, packaging, rain, or handling fees, when a consumer is already committed to making a purchase.10. Disguised ads involve influencers and celebrities promoting products or services without disclosing their paid endorsements, which can be misleading to consumers. This includes endorsements of personal experiences without disclosing the fact that they are paid for it.Dark patterns are deceptive or manipulative design elements or techniques used in user interfaces to trick users into taking actions they may not want to take. These patterns can intersect with the trademark and other intellectual property (IP) in various ways, although it’s important to note that the use of dark patterns is unethical and often violates principles of fair use and consumer protection.Dark patterns undermine the foundational principles of intellectual property law, leveraging deception, confusion, and unfair advantage to deceive users. By misusing trademarks and engaging in comparative advertising that distorts reality, these patterns erode the integrity of IP rights and compromise consumer trust. Addressing this intersection necessitates a focus on ethical design, compliance with IP laws, and the protection of consumers from deceptive practices.The proposed guidelines could potentially expose dark patterns on digital platforms in India, potentially leading to severe fines and costs. Alongside the guidelines, the following international instances can also serve as a reminder for web service providers about the ills of such dark patterns. .The Norwegian Consumer Council’s 2018 report revealed that Google, Facebook, and Microsoft used consent procedures that urged users to accept the lowest possible privacy settings through pre-selected settings, misleading language, hiding privacy-friendly options, and time pressure, potentially leading to millions of people unintentionally or unknowingly disabling or lowering privacy settings. In 2019, Booking.com, a popular EU travel booking platform, was ordered by the EU Commission to avoid certain design techniques, including time-pressure-inducing elements and cost concealment.In 2017, the European Commission investigated Google’s design decisions for unfairly giving its “Google Shopping” product an advantage in its search engine, while in 2019, the Australian competition authority criticized Google for misleading user interface design, specifically the registration path for new users.YouTube Kids, a colorful and simplified version of YouTube, is criticized for its autoplay feature, which keeps videos running without pause or interruption. Child safety advocates argue that this feature is a problem with the app and website. The Kids Internet Design and Safety (KIDS) Act, proposed last year, would ban the use of autoplay in kid-targeted apps. Experts at a recent Federal Trade Commission panel on dark patterns targeting children highlighted autoplay in children’s video apps as a concern, with some pointing specifically to YouTube. YouTube also earns from advertisers by inserting video ads and allowing longer ads. To avoid users being bothered by long ads, they created the “Skip Ad” button. YouTube’s dark pattern ensures users don’t always skip ads, making it less noticeable.The Office of Attorney General of the District of Columbia (OAG) has filed a complaint against Google for violating consumer protection laws. The OAG accused Google of making it impossible for users to opt out of location tracking, deceiving them about privacy settings, and using “dark patterns” to undermine informed choices. Consequently, Google agreed to pay a $9,500,000 penalty, issue notifications, and comply with annual compliance reports. It was also reported that subsequent lawsuits were also filed by Attorney Generals of Texas, Indiana and Washington in their respective states. A 2019 Princeton University report revealed that 11% of shopping websites used aggressive, misleading, deceptive, and potentially illegal patterns on their product pages, highlighting the prevalence of dark patterns in the industry. This highlights the need for ethical products and increased customer trust, as dark patterns exploit human psychology to persuade against personal interests.Big companies like Google, YouTube, and Microsoft can incorporate ethical alternatives to dark patterns on digital platforms. Instead of Interface Interference, which is easy to sign up for but difficult to unsubscribe from, platforms can offer a retention package to encourage customer retention. Nagging, which involves persistent, repetitive requests for action, can be avoided by showing pop-ups at the right or left corner. Instead of Basket Sneaking, platforms can present additional options as suggestions on the shopping cart, allowing consumers to add relevant products if missed. Privacy deception should be avoided, and offers and interactions should be transparent about price and key benefits. By considering these alternatives, companies can avoid dark patterns activities and maintain customer satisfaction."

Chancery Pavilion v. Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd: Karnataka High Court’s Problematic Finding on Section 60 SuitsRecently, the Karnataka High Court in Chancery Pavilion v. Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. held that instituting a subsequent copyright infringement suit will render a suit against the groundless threats of legal proceedings u/s 60 infructous. However, the High Court seemingly missed taking into account a key detail that the relevant copyright infringement suit was disposed of in 2015.

Agreeing with the statutory interpretation adopted by the single judge, the court held against the argument of “copyright hoarding” by the respondent and called out the appellant for resorting to Section 31D to avoid paying the license fees. In their co-authored post, Sidhi, Praharsh and Swaraj write on this order.Hulm Entertainment Pvt. Ltd. vs Fantasy Sports Myfab11 Pvt. Ltd.& Ors. on 17 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court) The Delhi High Court vacated an ex parte interim injunction against the defendant, restricting it from using its app for being similar to the plaintiff’s app. It was alleged that the defendant’s app imitates the “trading/ stock” feature and the GUI of the plaintiff’s app. However, the court clarified that the plaintiff’s feature is not an original expression and that similar apps existed before the plaintiff’s app. The court further held that the defendant’s GUI is substantially different from the plaintiff’s and thus on the basis of the above reasons passed the present order.Kama Ayurveda Private Limited vs The Arya Vaidya Pharmacy on 17 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court denied an exemption request from the plaintiff regarding advance service to the defendant in a case involving trademark infringement of ayurvedic pharmaceutical products. An application was filed by the plaintiff under the apprehension that the defendant would continue to use the subject mark after the expiry of the license agreement. The court however refused to hear the injunction application without the advance service. It was held that advance service is required under the IPD and Delhi High Court (Original Side) Rules. Furthermore, the court observed that there is no averment within the plaint that the defendant has commenced to use the mark after the expiry of the license and considering that the products are “Ayurveda pharmaceutical” products, the court may have to examine the impact of Section 30 (1)(a).M/S Mex Switchgears Pvt. Ltd. vs Vikram Suri on 13 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)An appeal was preferred against the impugned order whereby the appellant’s opposition was “deemed abandoned” by the respondent for not filing any evidence or statement in support of the opposition. The appellant, however, argued that evidence/statement shall be adduced to counter statements that were served. Since the service took place over an email, without the appellant providing its mail id in the notice of opposition, such service was improper under Section 143. The court held that Section 143 allowed for email service if an email id was provided by the party, indicating the party’s consent to such service. In this case, since no email address was given in the notice of opposition, email service was deemed improper and the impugned order was set aside.Intervet International B.V. &Anr vs Cuckos Pharmaceutical Private on 13 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff sought an interim injunction from the court, restraining the defendant from infringing the suit patent for ‘FLURALANER,’ sold as ‘Bravecto’ which is used to treat tick fever, ticks, and fleas in animals. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant was advertising, manufacturing, and selling a similar product under the mark ‘BRAVOGARD,’ which infringed on their patent and trademark. However, after receiving the suit papers, the defendant claimed they would not manufacture or sell ‘FLURALANER’ tablets. The court held that considering the plaintiff’s patent having been granted and recognized in various other suits and in view of similar marks, the plaintiff has made a prima facie case for the grant of an injunction. The court further held that considering the pharmaceutical nature of the product, irreparable harm would be caused to the plaintiff if the injunction was not granted. Therefore, the court passed an interim injunction order, prohibiting the defendants from using the mark ‘Bravogard’ and the plaintiff’s Fluralaner patent. On 16th October, the parties reached a settlement on the patent dispute.Delhi Public School Society vs Aviral Education Welfare and Ors. on 16 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff filed an application alleging noncompliance of the earlier injunction by the defendant and the defendant’s application seeking more time to comply with the injunction order. The defendant was earlier restrained from using the DPS mark owing to the termination of its agreement with the plaintiff whereby they were allowed to use the mark. The court held that though the defendants are in contempt of the earlier order, considering that the defendants are running a school where more than 500 students were studying, it took a compassionate view and allowed the defendants to use the DPS mark till 31st March 2024 and directed that any fresh admission for the academic year 2024-25 shall be under a new name. This was subjected to the condition that the defendants pay an additional sum of Rs. 20,00,000 plus GST.Fsn E-Commerce Ventures Ltd &Anr. vs No.2- Nykaa E-Retail Pvt. Ltd. on 12 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff sought to restrain the defendants from using the mark “Oykaa” for cosmetics, as the same was alleged to be similar to the plaintiff’s “Naykaa” mark. Relying on the “triple identity test”, the court held that plaintiffs have made a strong prima facie case for an injunction to prevent further harm to their business and reputation. Thus, the court ordered the suspension of the Defendants’ website and the removal of their product listings on third-party platforms to protect consumers from potential confusion and harm.Tv Today Network Limited vs Capital Tv And Ors on 12 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff filed the suit against the use of allegedly identical names by the defendant fir their news programs. The court recognized that the plaintiff’s TV channels and programs are quite popular and reiterated that though titles of the news programs may not themselves be capable of being monopolized, they can be protected if they have acquired secondary significance. Comparing the marks for the plaintiff’s TV programs with the defendant’s, the court held that the defendant is attempting to either pass off its program as that of the plaintiff’s or is trying to claim some connection or affiliation with the plaintiff and thus passed an ad interim injunction in favor of the plaintiff.Nishita Design AndAnr vs Clay Craft India Private Limited on 13 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff, holding registered designs for “Devanagiri” and “Banaras” used on crockery, alleged infringement and piracy by the defendants. The court compared the competing designs and granted an ad interim injunction for “Devanagiri”. However, for “Banaras” the court noted substantial differences between the competing designs. The court observed that the certificate of novelty in “Banaras” design certifies that the novelty resides in “surface ornamentation of the plate”, which according to the court, contains concentric levels and thus the extent to which there has been replication of the suit design by the defendant on its cup is arguable and thus granted the defendant an opportunity to file their reply.Saga Music Private Limited &Anr. vs Sony Music Entertainment India on 16 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff sought an injunction against the use of the ‘Jalsa’ sound recording by Defendant No. 3, Satinder Singh Sartaj, and declarations that he has no rights to it. In light of the pending suits on the same song and an earlier order restraining groundless threats against the defendant, the court allowed existing YouTube videos of the Sydney Opera House concert to remain online but required defendants to disclose earnings from these videos and prohibited the upload of new ones.Red Bull Ag Vs Rohidas Popat Kapadnis & Anr on 16 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff alleged infringement of its blue and silver with trapezial design trade dress and sought an injunction against the defendant’s use of the trade dress for their “SEVEN HOURS” energy drink products. Though an earlier interim injunction order was passed by the court allowing the defendant to sell off the filled cans of energy drinks bearing impugned trade dress, the court further allowed the defendants to sell off unfilled cans, considering the use of the impugned trade dress by the defendants since 2021 and no complaints regarding the safety of the products being sold. However, the court directed the defendants to pay INR 13 lakhs to the Plaintiff and instructed that any unsold cans post January 31, 2024 shall be destroyed. Sopariwala Exports and Ors v. Ashraf V on 09 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)Holding the plaintiff’s “Afzal” mark and the defendant’s “Afsal” mark for chewing tobacco as deceptively similar, the Delhi High Court restrained the defendant from using the impugned mark. Passing the present order, the High Court also observed that an imitator who chooses to ride on another’s reputation may be presumed to not be wary of the quality of its own products and since consumption of spurious tobacco can result in serious and often irreparable harm, court’s vigilance in the present matter is justified."

    "data": "[This post has been authored by SpicyIP intern Rohan Srivastava. Rohan is a Second Year student at National Law School Of India University and has a keen interest in IPR and Technology Law.]The recent increase in COVID-19 cases in India comes as a Deja Vu, reminiscent of the predicament India and the world were in 2 years ago. While the spike should not be a cause of concern owing to a proper vaccination run (also see here for the number of doses administered), elsewhere, experts and delegates are still engaged in negotiations over a possible extension of the TRIPS waiver to medical supplies and pharmaceuticals products. The TRIPS waiver, which became a hot topic for debates around multilateralism from October 2020, brought to the forefront the international community’s inaction and paralysis in the face of a global crisis of unprecedented scale. The fact that the negotiations recently extended the deadline for deciding on the waiver, almost a year after the medical emergency was subdued, is itself a testament to how time taking and inefficient the waiver fiasco has ended up being. This post will seek to look back at the controversy surrounding the waiver and reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight. In doing so, this post shall uncover the handicaps in seeking the TRIPS waiver, both internally in the WTO decision-making process and problems with the idea of a waiver as a way out of the crisis. This piece will then conclude with certain considerations that must be kept in mind for the future.The Pandemic was not the first time that the WTO’s inefficient decision-making process came to the forefront. (For example- Trade Law enthusiasts will recall the painstakingly long Doha Round of Negotiations, which were the 9th round of negotiations and the first since the WTO was established.) Part of the reason behind the WTO’s inefficient decision-making is its consensus-based model. Consensus, at WTO, means the lack of sustained opposition i.e. a decision is made when no member formally objects to it. (In the context of the TRIPS waiver, the consensus-based decision-making model can be seen in Article IX: 3 (1) of the Marrakesh agreement r/w Footnote 1.)Thus, decision-making at the WTO requires lobbying each and every member of the Organization in support, which often ends up being a zero-sum game for the members. While there is certainly merit in having this consensus-based approach, insofar as it is more democratic and allows due consideration to be given to all viewpoints, the pandemic has clearly exposed that the same rationale may be turned on its head during a medical health emergency. Already, there has been a lot of global north and global south contention over the availability of essential medicines at the time of crisis. For instance, the HIV/AIDS crisis and the surrounding access to medicines issue that started off in 2001 and fructified into an amendment only in 2017 (see here). The same was reflected in the context of TRIPS COVID-19 Vaccine waiver as well, where first a broad waiver was proposed by the member countries (see here and here) and after the subsequently revised proposals (see here), the existing waiver, which applies only on vaccines, was accepted. These instances show how the consensus-based approach at the WTO, which can be argued to protect the interests of the less influential countries, can also work against them when decision-making is required to be made in emergencies where time is of the essence. This is especially significant since the developing countries have for long been in majority in the WTO but still have not had their say, for the self-interests of a handful of developed nations (read here and here). What is even more ironic is that despite the strong resistance by the developed nations in the negotiation process which led to further delays in reaching a conclusive and timely waiver, the ministerial council’s final decision did not even concern the developed nations as they were not eligible members as per the document. What is to be kept in mind is that it was ultimately the developing countries that had to face the brunt of being deprived of their IP Protection. (Find more on this here.) Looking at the October 2020 draft, proponents claimed that a waiver is necessary to ensure proper access because the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS such as compulsory licensing etc. are not feasible in an emergency such as the pandemic. However, proponent countries themselves actively refused from utilising already existing flexibilities first to reach the above assertion. For instance, the Indian Supreme Court even questioned the Indian government’s reluctance to utilise compulsory licensing provisions in domestic law on precisely this point, and yet there was no action on this front. (Read more on this here) The lack of an efficient internal decision-making process at the WTO and wide disagreements over the desirability of a waiver raises the question of whether it is the appropriate recourse at times of crisis or if the global community would do better to envisage alternative mechanisms in the future. The opponents of the waiver, who were mostly the developed nations housing the major pharmaceutical manufacturers, argued that the October 2020 waiver will take away the incentive to innovate the cure for the pandemic. They instead argued that the members should utilize the flexibilities incorporated within the TRIPS in order to cater to the rising need for essential commodities. Even the final ministerial decision was an iteration of the opponent’s sentiment only, in so far as it did not technically waive off any IPR protections under the TRIPS but instead clarified the existing flexibilities. Looking at the TRIPS agreement, one can see that it is cognizant of the need to balance such social imperatives with the protection of IPR, and has incorporated relevant structural features. For instance, Article 7 provides that the ‘protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare’ while Article 8 states that Members ‘may, in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health … provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of the Agreement’. The TRIPS agreement makes it clear that Members are free to pursue legitimate public policy objectives. Furthermore, despite claims to the contrary, TRIPS flexibilities, including mandatory licensure, pharmaceutical transition measures, parallel importation, and research exceptions, have all been used and successfully demonstrated. For instance, a study by Ellen t’Hoen et al on the use of TRIPS flexibilities found that 89 countries used TRIPS flexibilities 176 times between 2001 and 2016, with over half of those uses (79.5%) involving Compulsory license, public noncommercial use, and LDC pharmaceutical transition measure. Thus, one would not be wrong to think that a lot of crucial time wasted in the negotiations at the time of the crisis could have been saved, had the proponents focussed more on aggressively pursuing the existing options or seeking clarification regarding the same for greater certainty, especially given that this was what was eventually agreed to instead of having a blanket waiver. It is undoubtedly true that a global crisis of such a magnitude would require multilateral cooperation and collective initiatives, the question however is what could be achieved by a patent waiver when most LDC countries lack the required infrastructure capabilities to actually engage in vaccine manufacture. Looking at a chart of key vaccine developing countries (here) one can see that there are only a handful of developing countries with vaccine manufacturing prowess. Assuming the broader waiver proposal was accepted, the opponents (housing the majority of vaccine developers) could still have refused to apply the same in their countries, (this intent is evident from the outcome waiver document that expressly exempts the developed countries from the ambit of its application). And thus, the only benefit that would have occurred out of the broad waiver would have been the flexibility to not be sued for non-consensual use of the IP involved in the production of the vaccines, by the manufacturers located in these developing- broad waiver proponent countries. However, it is pertinent to note, that if the ultimate benefit of the waiver would have been the freedom from being sued for non-consensual use of the underlying IP, then as argued above, TRIPS already caters to it under Article 73 (b)(iii), and thus making the whole exercise largely a rut. It is also interesting to note that the developed countries which came to the table in favour of the TRIPS waiver in the name of multilateral cooperation for assuring equitable access to vaccines, were at the same time also doing lip service to their commitments by signing bulky procurement orders with multiple vaccine manufacturers to keep their eggs in several baskets. These orders were also often in excess of the vaccine requirement of the particular country, at a time when vaccine availability across the world was uncertain. The TRIPS negotiation allowed vaccine nationalism to maintain face at the international fora as is also evident from the final ministerial decision which limited the applicability to the developing countries and LDCs. (Refer here) It thus becomes evident that a TRIPS waiver cannot be seen as a ready response that will act as a panacea to the woes of vaccine availability during times of crisis. With regards to the internal process in the WTO, the pandemic has made it clear that WTO cannot be expected to make ad-hoc decisions due to the consensus requirements given that differing considerations, such as the impact on innovation etc. are involved in such a decision. The only hope on the IPR front would be for the WTO to create structural safeguards that can aid in times of such crisis and clarify such flexibilities. Given that the utility of a waiver itself is also under question, the WTO also needs to focus more on ensuring the availability of vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and treatment options by continuing its efforts to identify and reduce barriers to trade, to ensure that states which do not have the institutional capacity to make use of the waiver are not left out. One instance of such a barrier is regulatory bottlenecks which impeded the speedy dispersal of vaccines globally. (Read more on this here and here) In addition to this, there have also been criticisms against the TRIPS framework for being unable to protect the interest of developing nations and encouraging the growth of technology in the LDCs. So far, TRIPS has only ensured greater IP protection to technology-generating countries and there has been no trickle-down or transfer of technology from the higher-income countries to the LDCs, despite having provisions urging the same. It is imperative that WHO, which is better suited for responding to a global health crisis, steps up to the game for ensuring equitable access to vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other medical aid through multilateral cooperation. Much of the international cooperation in such efforts will also depend upon the fate of the global treaty for future pandemic emergencies under the WHO which is currently under negotiations. The main purpose of the initiative is to ensure early detection and prevention of future pandemics, including a stronger international health framework within the WHO that would attempt to ensure universal and equitable access to medical solutions. It is also pertinent to note that the treaty includes provisions for timely waiver of IP protection so that there is no tussle at the time of crisis and valuable time and lives are not wasted (Article 7.4). However, as if the international community refuses to learn, the negotiations are again facing institutional concerns and are being done in a non-transparent manner (See Talha Burki’s statement on this media coverage here). This can potentially undermine trust in the process and history might again repeat itself with another deadlock over the differences between the developed and developing nations and over the fate of countless lives.Multilateral cooperation at times of global emergencies like the pandemic is understandably hard to come by given the pressing needs each member state has internally. The COVID-19 pandemic cannot be seen as a one-off event and it is widely predicted that as man taps more with nature it is likely that there may be a rise in the frequency of pandemics. Thus, it would do well if the international community sees the entire TRIPS waiver fiasco as a lesson on how things pan out practically in times of crisis and is able to come up with more practical and efficient mechanisms which would allow all states to acquire an equitable supply of vaccines despite the socio-economic inequalities across the borders.

    "headline": "IP Rights, Access, and WHO’s Pandemic Accord Potential Loopholes in the Execution of Local Commission Rochem v. Nirtech – Analysing the Claim of Breach of Confidential Information An Obituary to the TRIPS ‘Waiver’: Lessons from an Imperfect Response",
    "data": "The Indian government has refused to disclose its collaboration agreements and investments made in developing and procuring India’s Covid 19 vaccine – Covaxin, the Indian mRNA and intranasal vaccine candidates.Despite widespread public interest in these arrangements, the government has consistently rejected Right to Information (RTI) applications requesting this information. (for the responses received from the CIC see here, here and here) Prashant Reddy (who needs no introduction on this blog) filed several RTI requests covering public-private partnership arrangements related to the Covid 19 vaccines. He has challenged the blanket refusal by the government before the Delhi High Court. He is represented by lawyers Swathi Sukumar and Sai Vinod (also a former SpicyIP blogger).Since 2021 the Indian public has been made aware of the existence of several public-private arrangements related to the development and procurement of Covid 19 vaccines. For instance, the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology, two government bodies, collaborated with Bharat Biotech to develop a Covid 19 vaccine – Covaxin. The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) also funded Gennova Pharmaceuticals and Bharat Biotech for their mRNA and intranasal vaccine candidates. Further, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare placed purchase orders for several vaccines.Since then, the Indian public has raised several questions regarding the details of these arrangements. Many articles (e.g. here and here) have questioned the lack of transparency, intellectual property rights concerns, and the lack of information about the amount of taxpayer money that has gone into these arrangements. It is clear that the public, whose money is being used, wants to know the details. More so because a substantial amount of public funds and resources have been expended in this regard. For context, more than 36 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered in India. However, the government has refused to provide information regarding these arrangements.In an attempt to characterise this issue as an intellectual property rights issue (rather than a governance issue), the government has cited an exemption under Section 8(d) of the RTI Act to withhold information. The categories of records exempt under Section 8(d) are ‘commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party.’ To be sure, this is not a blanket exemption. The competent authority can disclose even these categories of information if it is satisfied that ‘larger public interest warrants its disclosure’. Everything else aside, the arrangements in questions are not every day, ordinary arrangements. These arrangements relate to public authorities and a public purpose – developing vaccines to protect against Covid 19. Further, they arose out of and are inherently tied to a world-wide, deadly pandemic, an international health emergency, that the public is undoubtedly interested in. In fact, public disclosure of COVID-19 vaccine agreements is the global norm. The United States and the United Kingdom that collaborated with private companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines have released copies of their research and collaboration agreements under their Freedom of Information (FOI) laws with redactions. This by itself warrants disclosure and the government seems to have mischaracterised the issue at hand.Even otherwise, as argued in detail by Prashant in his petition, public-private agreements are subject to different treatment under the RTI Act. As per binding precedent, the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) is obligated to disclose public-private partnership agreements (Navroz Mody vs. Mumbai Port Trust). Further, government bodies like ICMR and BIRAC are obligated under law (Section 4 of the RTI Act) to publish information relating to public-private partnerships (PPPs) on the internet. In 2013, the Department of Personnel and Training issued guidelines which instructed public authorities to disclose “all information” relating to PPPs voluntarily including documents generated in the course of implementation of the PPPs, all payments made under PPPs along with the purpose of the payments. The government has also argued that since the contracts are on-going they should not be made to disclose them. But the petitioner has cited several cases where high courts have allowed disclosures even where contracts were ongoing or still in operation.As highlighted by the petitioner, instead of a blanket refusal, the concerned authority should have perused the documents in order to establish whether they contain any information relating to ‘trade secrets’ or ‘commercial confidence’ or ‘intellectual property’ – all terms that have specific meaning under law.It seems difficult to beat the law and the logic in the petition. Interestingly, the government seems to be flustered by the petitioner’s strong case and is resorting to cheap tactics – personally attacking him for ‘acting against the interest of the nation’ instead of fighting the matter on its merits."

    "data": "[This post is co-authored with Swaraj and SpicyIP intern Sidhi Pramodh Rayudu. Sidhi is a final year B.A. LL.B (Hons) student at Hidayatullah National Law University, Raipur. He is interested in IP law, and commercial and criminal litigation.]Can Over-The-Top (OTT) Streaming platforms be afforded the same legal protections for broadcasting as conventional mediums? After being answered in the negative by a single judge bench of the Bombay High Court in 2019, this question was once again answered in the negative by the Division Bench of the Bombay High Court. Though the order was passed in Oct 2022, it has only been uploaded on the High Court website in September 2023, almost a year later! In fact, a lot has happened in the music broadcasting scene at this time (for instance ISRA entered into an agreement with the Indian Music Industry, the Bombay High Court passed a landmark order on the rights of the authors of the underlying work). Anyhow, this post aims to delve into this division bench order, explaining why it is legally sound.Conventional media such as on TV and radio can avail of a statutory licensing scheme under Section 31D of the Copyright Act, under which any ‘broadcasting organization’ desirous of ‘communicating to the public’ any sound recording, may obtain a statutory license to do so, provided they pay the royalty rates to the copyright owners. Wynk, an OTT platform, tried to invoke this provision after a failed negotiation a few years ago, terming the demand of approx 4.5 crore for a 2-year access to Tips song repertoire as excessive. As previously covered on the blog here and here, Justice Kathawala’s comprehensive interim order in 2019 held that OTT platforms are not eligible for the 31D license, with the main reason for this finding being that Section 31D specifically addresses public communication of sound recordings through broadcast, not their commercial rental or sale. J. Kathawala also held that the legislature was well aware of the distinctions between rights associated with commercial rental or sale, and the right to broadcast, therefore the lack of explicit language indicated the lack of legislative intent towards this end.The Division Bench of the BHC seems to have largely agreed on its order and in some parts gone further than the earlier order.The Division Bench order mostly recounts the arguments advanced by the Parties and the observation made by the Single Judge earlier. While the order has been written in a convoluted manner, for clarity we think that its key takeaways can be divided into two sub-parts- First, on the Legislative Scheme of Statutory Licenses; and Second, on the Public Interest justifications.The assessment on this point begins with Wynk’s argument that the provision contemplates just the requirement of prior notice and that the medium of broadcast doesn’t matter as once Section 31D stipulates “broadcast” it’s immaterial how this broadcast is achieved. Countering this by reiterating Tips’ argument, the order notes that Section 31D (3) and (4) restrict the ambit of the provision to just radio and television broadcasting. This is further substantiated by harmoniously reading the Section with Rule 29 (1) (which requires royalty to be set before any notice can be sent) Rule 29 (3) and (4) (which prescribes the different requirements under the notices for broadcasting over television or radio) and Rule 31 (which bifurcates between the royalties for broadcast over Television and Radio). Furthermore, the DB agreed that at the time of the 2012 Amendment, internet streaming was still a thing and if provisions of 31D were to be extended thereon, then the Parliament would have done so. Therefore, much like the Single Judge, the Division Bench read the provision literally and held that Section 31D mandates statutory licensing only for radio and television broadcasting.The DB also clarified that to seek a license under Section 31D, before any notice is issued, the rate of royalty must be determined first.Another, argument put forth by Wynk was that Tips, by not allowing it to stream its repertoire was engaging in “copyright hoarding” and thus, for the sake of public interest, Wynk should be allowed to stream its repertoire under Section 31D. Countering this, Tips argued that if such an interpretation is allowed, then all the streamers will simply rely on a commercial court’s order fixing royalty and will force not only Tips (who has a big repository of songs) but also small artists, to stream their work at a price which may be less than the market rates. Tips further reiterated that Section 31D is an expropriatory provision and thus should be construed narrowly with the least burden on the person affected i.e. Tips. (Section 31D has previously been determined as expropriatory in Music Broadcast Ltd. v. Tips Industries.)On this point, the Division Bench set the record straight by expressly stating that both Wynk and Tips are “for the profit” entities. The DB observed that Wynk was not engaged in public service but rather its benefits can be accessed only upon the payment of subscription fees. The court thus held that allowing Wynk to obtain a license under Section 31D would be a perversion of statutory intent behind Section 31D.Come to think of it, though the Division Bench didn’t observe anything further on the obligation to determine royalties, looking the procedure under Rule 31(7) one can see that the relevant factors are extremely peculiar to linear broadcasting (like the one done over television or radio) and cannot be applied to compute royalties for non linear transmission like streaming. Some of the factors mandated under Rule 31(7) is the timeslot in which broadcast takes place; class of works that is to be broadcasted; nature of use of work; the terms and conditions included in the Grant of Permission Agreement (GOPA) between Ministry of Information and Broadcasting and the broadcaster for Operating Frequency Modulation (FM) Radio Broadcasting Service. Considering these factors and passing an all binding statutory license under Section 31D may get challenging even for broadcasting the work by a limited number of radio and television broadcasters. So, it’s unclear if the same considerations can apply against the umpteen streaming providers especially considering the nature of streaming in mind wherein the listener is granted a conductor’s podium with options such as curating playlists, scheduling songs, cached/offline storage etc. For all the above reasons, the determination of royalties for this non-linear transmission would have been very difficult under the factors specified in this sub-rule.Leaving aside the realistic challenge in determining the rate of royalties, it is pertinent to note that the Parliamentary Standing Committee Report on “Review of the Intellectual Property Rights Regime in India” (Para 14.8(ii) and 36(ii)) recommended incorporating amendments to Section 31D to include ‘internet or digital broadcasters’ under statutory license to level the playing field for both traditional and internet broadcasters. Furthermore, tangentially it seems relevant to mention that as this order of the Bombay HC was released, India was estimated to be the tenth largest OTT market, a point that has been recognized in the above report. Come to think of it, as pointed out by Surmayi in her post here, streaming generates a humongous revenue for the Indian music industry. Thus, considering the stakes involved for all the players, this story seems far from being over. Also, it is interesting to see that while a statutory license has been issued for broadcast over the radio (see here and here) and as seen from this order similar demands were made for broadcast via streaming platforms, no demands have been made for broadcast over television. (in case any reader knows of an instance where a request for a Section 31D license has been made for broadcast over television, please let us know in the comments.) Speaking specifically about this order, as pointed by Sandhya Surendran, this order seems like good news for record labels and not so much for the streaming industry. Particularly for Tips, the order could not have been published at a better time considering that only in March ’23 the news of an agreement with Jio Saavan to stream its songs broke out.The authors would like to thank an anonymous reader for their comments and input."

Clarification on Divisional Applications SpicyIP Tidbit: Advocate Faces Music for Concocting a Fake IPAB Order!",
    "data": "This post is co-authored with SpicyIP Intern Tejaswini Kaushal. Tejaswini is a 3rd-year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow. She is keenly interested in Intellectual Property Law, Technology Law, and Corporate Law. Her previous posts can be accessed here.Readers would recall that in the past we have written about Government notifications stressing on the menace caused by the threats of legal proceedings (see here and here). Section 60 of the Copyright Act is one safeguard against such “groundless threats” of legal proceedings, whereby the affected party can seek an injunction or recover damages. On September 27, 2023, the Karnataka High Court in M/s Chancery Pavilion v. Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd., passed an order interpreting the scope of this safeguard, reiterating that the right of the plaintiff to initiate actions against the “groundless threats” under Section 60 would be terminated in light of a separate suit by the defendant alleging copyright infringement, even if filed subsequent to the Section 60 suit. For this, the High Court relied on the proviso to Section 60, which states that the right to seek actions against the groundless threat of legal proceedings will not apply if the person making such threats, “with due diligence, commences and prosecutes an action for infringement of the copyright claimed by him.” The Court clarified that since one such action was initiated by the Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd. (IPRSL) (defendant) before the Delhi High Court, M/s Chancery Pavilion (plaintiff) cannot seek benefits under Section 60, regardless of the fact that the IPRSL’s suit was subsequent to Chancery Pavilion’s suit. On a surface level, this order seems to offer an important insight into the nature of Section 60. However, the Karnataka High Court seems to have clearly overlooked the fact that the Delhi High Court suit was disposed of in 2015 with directions to IPRS to file it before a competent court in Bangalore! Before we get to discussing this controversy in detail, let’s take a quick look at the background of this case. The plaintiff is a company operating hotels, restaurants, taverns, etc., which was aggrieved by the public notices and letters sent by the defendant, a copyright society, directing the plaintiff to obtain necessary licenses before playing any of their sound recordings. Though the plaintiff had taken a license earlier, the same expired in 2007, after which the defendant continued to threaten the plaintiff with legal actions against which the plaintiff filed a suit u/s 60 in Bangalore on January 19, 2013. Subsequently, the defendant filed a separate suit before the Delhi High Court on April 2, 2013. In light of the subsequent suit by the defendant, the trial court rejected the plaintiff’s suit on December 5, 2014 against which the plaintiff preferred an appeal before the Karnataka High Court. In the appeal, Karnataka High Court agreed with the trial court’s interpretation of the provision and disposed of the appeal without issuing any finding on merits. The proviso of section 60 has seen a rather divergent application over time. On the one hand, in a Calcutta High Court decision in Radio Today Broadcasting Ltd. v. Indian Performing Right Society Limited, the court has held that a Section 60 suit alleging groundless threat does not become infructuous if the defendants file a subsequent infringement suit. In contrast lie a plethora of cases, including that of the Supreme Court in M/s Mac Charles (I) Ltd. v. M/s Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd, the Delhi High Court in Super Cassette Industries Ltd. v. Bathla Cassettes India (P) Ltd., and the Madras High Court in Q.D Seatamon Designs Private Limited v. P. Suresh, where it has been held that a Section 60 suit does become infructuous on filing of a subsequent infringement suit. The Supreme Court’s presence for the latter proposition weighs the scales down in its favor. So, the bottom line from the decisions is that the defendant, against whom the suit under Section 60 of the Copyright Act is filed, or the threatener, can defeat the plaintiff’s suit by commencing a prosecution against the plaintiff, but only after carrying out “due diligence” (the multi-faceted nature of this term have been discussed here) in light of the proviso of Section 60. However, one may wonder whether this interpretation is taking away the primary purpose of Section 60, as after all, it can be perceived that the subsequent infringement suit is filed to essentially counterblast the suit filed under Section 60. On this note, in Zee Entertainment Enterprises Ltd. v. Saregama India Ltd., the Delhi High Court commented on the “juridical philosophy” of Section 60, which aims to prevent harassment of parties receiving copyright violation notices and activates the proviso when the party alleging infringement initiates an action after due diligence. Similarly, in the Bathla Cassettes case, the Delhi High Court has explained that Section 60 is designed to protect a person against any wrongful threats, and thus, the remedy is to seek injunctions against such threats. However, the provision will not be applicable when an action against the alleged infringement has been initiated in furtherance of such threats. Thus, it makes it clear that Section 60 has a very limited scope and perhaps cannot be seen on the same footing as that of a suit alleging infringement.From the above discussion we can see that any suit under Section 60 operates parallelly with the infringement suit and thus, the existence of a separate infringement is sine qua non before disposing of the suit under Section 60. In M/s Chancery Pavilion, too, section 60 has been interpreted narrowly but is still in line with the more popular interpretation of the courts. However, what’s amusing here is that before the Karnataka High Court order was passed, the Delhi High Court had already returned the plaint back to IPRSL in 2015, with directions to file the suit before a competent court in Karnataka. The Karnataka High Court, while dismissing the appeal, relied on M/s Mac Charles (I) Ltd., vs. M/s Indian Performing Rights Society Ltd and regarded the suit in the Delhi High Court as a substantial action fulfilling the condition of due diligence. The court thus seemed to operate under the assumption that the infringement suit before the Delhi High Court suit is still open. This is clear from the observation in para. 32 – “it is always open for the plaintiff to have its defence filed before the High Court at Delhi and get the suit decided on the merits…” But in reality, though, the Delhi High Court disposed of the case on October 1, 2015. On this, it is pertinent to note that the proviso of Section 60 clearly uses the words “commences” and “prosecutes,” and thus, where there is no ongoing “prosecution” anymore in Delhi, the question arises: shouldn’t the court have considered this fact while disposing of the appeal? Furthermore, it is noteworthy that none of the parties have also pointed out these facts to the court as seen from the orders passed by the Karnataka High Court (see the list of the orders here). In one of the orders dt. November 09, 2017, the significance of this dispute vis a vis the chance to interpret Section 60 was highlighted. But if an interpretation of Section 60 was expected, shouldn’t the parties inform the court about all the aspects of the case, including the information about the fate of the Delhi High Court suit?Now, in practice, the Delhi High Court seems to have no ongoing infringement case, and the appeal against the Section 60 order has also been denied. It is possible that the parties may have resolved this matter long ago and are no longer interested in pursuing it. However, by omitting to consider the developments in the Delhi suit, it is unclear if the Karnataka High Court order can be regarded as a robust interpretation of the provision. While the Court’s interpretation, in line with the Supreme Court case, lends this order higher precedential weight, it should have also taken into account the subsequent developments that took place since the impugned order. However, dismissing the appeal without due consideration of the facts in parallel matters sets an undesirable precedent. This can potentially impact the long-term interpretation of Section 60. The section’s language, indicating an ongoing, present case, demands meticulous interpretation to uphold its correct application, and this order’s precedential value could jeopardize that. The current order unmistakably contains significant oversights in both factual and legal aspects that cannot be overlooked.A big thanks to Lokesh for his help on this!"

Later, when the first draft was released, it was called the National Innovation Act (NIA), 2008. Said to have been inspired by the American COMPETES Act, 2007, the draft Act was to “facilitate public, private or public-private partnership initiatives for building an Innovation support system to encourage Innovation ….” Endeavors with similar objectives have been made earlier as well, e.g., through the Public Funded Research and Development (Protection, Utilisation and Regulation of Intellectual Property) Bill, 2007 aka Indian Bayh Dole Act. More recently, Swaraj wrote about Bayh Dole-esque Guidelines notified by Dept of Biotechnology. Here, Prashant and Saranya’s post suggesting that India has Spent Rs. 1,00,000 crores on Scientific Research Over the Last Decade with no transparency and calling for reviving discussions around an Indian ‘Bayh Dole’ bill also needs highlighting.Coming back to NIA, among other things, the NIA Act also became known for its objective to codify and consolidate the law of confidentiality and trade secrets – something for which there is no specific law in India. Mihir Naniwadekar discussed the issue here through his two-part post – here and here. I think it was the first (and only?) draft Act that attempted to codify trade secret law. (Please correct me if I am wrong.) However, since the draft was never tabled in the parliament, it never saw the day of actual discussion, let alone enactment and implementation. Recently, in the 161st report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee Report on Review of the IPR regime in India, there came a suggestion of making a separate law for trade secrets in India. Maybe, we will see a day in the future when this unmade legislation will be revisited. Until then, this will remain one of those unmade laws in India, lingering as a promising but unfulfilled endeavor in the country’s legal landscape.When IPO made the TM database Open: Thirteen years ago, the Indian TM database became openly accessible, a significant step towards transparency and ease of access, as highlighted by Sumathi Chandrasekharan. Yes … the current level of accessibility wasn’t always the case in the IP domain neither in trademark nor in patent domain! In fact, the Registry used to generate a sum of around 4 crores INR, from trademark searches before embracing public access. Despite these advancements, the efficiency of the database (or the larger issue of transparency in the administration of IP institutions) has remained a consternating concern, often leaving practitioners dissatisfied. Whether it’s the IPAB website or the Indian patent website, the recurrent issue of non-functional platforms doesn’t surprise us anymore. The recent public notice by CGPDTM limiting access to trademark public search and E-Registry features for indefinite time serves as a reminder that challenges persist, necessitating continual enhancements and the resolution of systemic issues.Patent Agent and the Dubious Dichotomy of Science vs Law: The issue of/around Patent agents and their qualifying examinations has been extensively discussed on the blog. One pertinent post on this subject was from this month in 2010 called the Patent Eligibility and the Logic of Law and Science. In the post, Prof. Basheer endorsed the point about testing patent agents on foundational legal subjects since a good part of patent prosecution will involve “legal” aspects, without requiring them to have a law degree to take the exam. Drawing ideas from previous posts like “Is it Unconstitutional for the Patent Office to be the Adjudicatory Authority deciding Oppositions & CL proceedings?”, the post followed the discussion on Patent Competence which brooded some broader policy questions around the qualification of patent officials at IPO. Among other questions, the post asked if the prospective Officers to the Indian Patent Office (IPO) – an issue that arose at that time — should be subjected to the patent agent exam and if they should know the Patents Act and Rules prior to being appointed. The topic was particularly pondered in a post called “Is “Science” Essential for Creating Patent Lawyers?” where Prof. Basheer categorically conceptualized the issue of the importance of “technical background” for patent practice. Fast forward to today, a law degree is not a requirement to become a patent agent nor are such agents required to be tested on fundamental legal subjects as recommended then. However, given the increasingly important role of patent agents in patent prosecution (see e.g. here), who are arguably out of the purview of any liability that advocates owe to their clients (as Prashant argued here), it is worth asking if the legal framework around patent agents needs revision.Romanticising Innovation: In September 2010, Prof. Basheer penned a post called “Romanticising Innovation and Showcasing Reality” sharing the news of the launch of a reality TV show that aimed to identify innovative minds, who can solve the problems of the masses with their innovative ideas. The long-time readers of the blog would know that Romanticising Innovation is a theme that is very dear to the blog (particularly, see here). And why not? After all, IPRs are for fuelling innovation and driving progress. Aren’t they? Although it’s a different question that these terms have nowadays become fancy phrases thrown almost everywhere, with less discussion on what they mean. Over the years, although we couldn’t witness much (direct) discussion on the topic on the blog, discussion and work on the topic galore outside through conferences and awards ceremonies (e.g. through the ASEAN-India Grassroots Innovation Forum or Grassroots Innovations Accelerator program or Biennial National Grassroots Innovation and Outstanding Traditional Knowledge Awards of NIF). A few months ago, Aparajita shared the story of Navjot Sawhney who was awarded for his hand-cranked washing machines in the U.K. Interestingly, as Aparajita noted, Remya was also an innovator with a similar innovation who also got an award, though her innovation did not take off commercially. The upshot here is that – while the tales of Navjot, Remya, and other award winners deserve our applause and celebration, it’s equally important to remember that awards mainly serve as a nod to informal innovation. However, a well-conceived plan for their commercialization needs to be carved out.Patent Opposition: Navigating SpicyIP’s September pages, I chanced upon a 2009 piece from Prof. Basheer discussing the study he conducted on opposition to pharmaceutical patent applications between 2005 and 2008 showing their abysmal number (3 % of the total applications filed!). As the research revealed, the majority of these oppositions relied on Section 3(d). The post asked why oppositions filed were so low, a question that remains relevant today and has become even more important, given the decreasing number of oppositions over the years – about 1.1% in 2020-21 and 0.69% in 2021-22 of the total published applications. (See the Annual Reports here) What appears to have worsened over the years is the availability of specific data on not only patent oppositions (as highlighted here) but other important areas like the information about applications filed in a specific sector/entities. For instance, earlier in the Annual Report for the year 2008-2009, details of the top 10 applicants in the pharma sector were also given. However, no such details about the pharma sector are provided anymore, as seen from the latest annual report here.For context, there are two types of oppositions – pre-grant and post-grant – and both have their share of issues. While some courts emphasize the sanctity of the right to oppose the grant of a patent, others have refused to allow writ petitions when pre-grant oppositions are rejected. One critical aspect that often complicates the opposition system is the question of “who” can file it. The law is clear on this – “any person” can file a pre-grant opposition, while only “interested persons” can submit post-grant opposition. However, some courts have misinterpreted them, as Swaraj nicely argued here. Another issue that has long infested the opposition system, especially the post-grant one is the delays and indefinite timelines. In any case, the area demands more attention and deliberation given the not-so-reliable data available on this topic.That’s a wrap for the sift of Septembers! Next stop: the perky pages of “October.” Did I miss any noteworthy posts or events or anything you think deserves mention? Please drop them in the comments. Until then, catch you next month!Thanks to Praharsh for his input on the piece."

Look no further as we present to you the SpicyIP Weekly Review, highlighting the discussions that took place on the blog along with other IP news. Looking at the DHC’s order in Jainemo Pvt. Ltd. v. Rahul Shah Through the lens of the DU Photocopy CaseRecently the Delhi High Court issued an injunction against unlawful dissemination of Jainemo Pvt. Ltd. (Apna College)’s study material online. How well does this order fare in light of the Court’s finding in the DU Photocopy Case? Read Yogesh’s post to know more about this.Is There More Than Meets the Eye? Delhi High Court and the Recent Section 124 DilemmasDelhi High Court and the tryst with Section 124! Just a few days after passing an important clarification about the alternate route to seek rectification sans fulfilling the Section 124 requirement, the Delhi High Court faces another dilemma. This time the question is whether a rectification application can be filed before the issue of invalidity of the plaintiff’s mark has been framed and the suit has been stayed under Section 124. Tejaswini and Praharsh write on these orders.An Update on the Emami v. Dabur: A Qualified Right to be Heard for Ad Interim InjunctionsAfter much furore, Delhi High Court clarifies that its earlier observation about affording the defendants an opportunity to be heard in ad interim injunction cases is a ‘qualified’ one. Tejaswini writes on this development.Raytheon Company v. Controller General of Patents and Designs: The Question of CRI and 3(k)Delhi High Court’s recent order directing the Indian Patent Office to re-examine the application in terms of the 2017 CRI Guidelines instead of the 2016 Guidelines, reignites the age-old debate on the patentability of Computer Related Inventions against the mandate of Section 3(k). Read Yogesh’s assessment of the order.The Tale of Indian Dynamic Injunctions Jurisprudence: One Step Forward Two Steps BackHas the jurisprudence of Dynamic Injunctions in India been “a step forward and two steps back”? Since its first use, the dynamic injunctions have progressively been widening through the years. Krishna Ravishankar and Parul Anand write on this journey of dynamic injunctions in India and suggest means to help the court in assuring proportionality.A Reminder to File Comments/ Suggestions on IP Manuals and GuidelinesLast week we had put out a reminder for our readers to file their comments/ suggestions on IP Manuals and Guidelines, before the CGPDTM. The last day to file these comments/ suggestions was October 15.Tata Sons Private Limited & Anr.vs. Puro Wellness Private Limited & Anr on 10 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff alleged disparagement to its mark via the defendant’s pink salt commercial but failed to establish a prima facie case. The court held that the defendant’s advertising falls under the ambit of permissible comparative advertising, rejecting the plaintiff’s claims and emphasized on a competitor’s right to prevent disparagement while allowing reasonable product promotion.The Chinese University of Hong Kong and Anr. v. The Assistant Controller of Patent and Designs on 12 October, 2023 (Madras High Court)Allowing the appeal against the impugned order that rejected the appellant’s patent application for being a diagnostic method, the Madras High Court held that since the invention was per se incapable of identifying the existence of a disease, it will not be barred by Section 3(i). Passing the order, the court also clarified that the term “diagnostic” under Section 3(i) should neither be construed narrowly, limited to only in-vivo or definitive diagnosis, nor broadly to include any process relating to diagnosis. Rather, the court opined, the claims should be examined in the context of the complete specification, to determine whether it specifies a process for making a diagnosis for treatment, and if it is concluded that the diagnosis for treatment is made (even if not definitive) the claims will be patent ineligible.Kross S.A. vs Vijay Munjal And Anr. on 10 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court rejected the plaintiff’s application to amend the plaint and the memo of parties to add new defendants for lack of prior due diligence by them. Through this amendment application, the plaintiff attempted to implead the impugned mark’s proprietors as parties to the suit. The court relied on the proviso to Order VI Rule 17 of the CPC to reiterate that in order to allow such an application, the party has to show that it has conducted necessary due diligence and despite the due diligence the plea for amendment could not be raised before the commencement of the trial. Since the plaintiff was unable to show that it exercised due diligence before the commencement of trial and in fact it was aware about the proprietorship of these additional parties on the impugned marks, the court rejected its amendment application.Britannia Industries Limited vs Amar Biscuit Private Limited on 12 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court passed an ad interim injunction, restricting the defendants from using the mark “Good Time Butter Cookies”. Holding that the impugned mark is similar to the plaintiff’s “Good Day” mark, the court held that butter cookies are products that are purchased by children, literate and illiterate people across rural and urban areas and the enormous turnover of the plaintiff’s “Good Day” cookies leaves no doubt that the mark has achieved enormous recognition and goodwill in the market.Syngenta Limited vs Controller Of Patents And Designs on 13 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)A Division Bench of the Delhi High Court responded to the questions on divisional applications referred to it by the Single Judge earlier. The single judge had expressed apprehensions over correctness of another single judge order passed in Boehringer Ingelheim International GMBH vs. The Controller of Patents and referred the following 2 two questions to the division bench- 1) Does the requirement of parent application to contain plurality of inventions without any objections by the Controller, necessary?; 2) Does the plurality of invention has to be reflected in claims of the parent application or is it sufficient if the plurality is reflected in Complete Specification? Relying on the language of Section 16, the division bench overruled the Boehringer Ingelheim order and held that a divisional application will be maintainable provided the plurality of application is disclosed in the provisional or complete specification. On the first question, the court clarified that there is no distinction between the requirement of plurality of invention for divisional application when it is moved by the applicant on its own motion or on the basis of the Controller’s order and in both cases, plurality of invention is a must.M/S Bikaji Foods Int. Ltd vs M/S Desai Brothers Limited & Anr with Bikaner Bhujia Udyog Sangh v. M/S Desai Brothers Limited on 11 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)In a dispute involving allegations of unauthorized use of the Geographical Indication “Bikaneri Bhujiya” the court ordered the defendants to produce alternate packaging to distinguish their products from the defendants and maintain a distinction between GI and non GI products. The court also appointed a local commissioner to examine the extent of manufacturing taking place in the premises of Defendant no 1 and 2 in Bikaner for production of “Bikaneri Bhujiya.”Japan Patent Office vs Ms. A2Z Glass And Glazing Co. & Ors. on 11 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)In a suit filed by the Japanese Patent Office alleging infringement of its mark, the Delhi High Court passed an ex-parte interim injunction, restraining the defendant from using the JPO mark. While passing the order, the court opined that though JPO does not have a trademark or copyright registration in its favor, it could have never imagined that its logo would be imitated by anyone.Humans of Bombay Stories Pvt. Ltd. v. POI Social Media Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. on 11 October, 2023 (Delhi High Court)Observing that the present case raises the classic case of idea-expression dichotomy, the Delhi High Court held that while there cannot be any monopoly over the running of storytelling platforms, (idea) copyright can be claimed over the way these stories are expressed in form of images, literary content and manner in which these stories are depicted on the platform, exclusive to them. The court thus, held that both Humans of Bombay and People of India cannot replicate each other’s literary works and commissioned images/ videos.Jagdish Sharma and Anr v. K. K Radhamohan and Ors. on 13 October, 2023 (Patiala House Court) In a suit seeking an injunction over the release of the cinematograph film “Ruslaan”, the Patiala House Court reiterated that there cannot be any copyright claim over the title of a work. Though the plaintiff accepted that the name “Ruslaan” was not registered as a trademark, it argued that the title of its film has acquired a secondary meaning and allowing the defendant to use the same can lead to confusion. However, the court opined that the plaintiff’s movie was released in 2009 and “can be said to have faded in the public memory” whereas the defendant’s movie is generating much more publicity than the plaintiff’s movie and thus there does not appear to be any likelihood of confusion. The court also presumed that before making a choice, the viewer will carefully look through the poster and decide after some background research about the actors, storyline director etc. and thus held that there is no prima facie case for an interim injunction.H/t to the All IP Care team for sharing the Jagdish Sharma order with us."

Clarification on Divisional Applications SpicyIP Tidbit: Advocate Faces Music for Concocting a Fake IPAB Order!",
    "data": "Recently on October 11, a Division Bench of the Delhi High Court clarified that its earlier observation (in Dabur v. Emami), to accord the Respondent an opportunity to be heard before deciding on an ad interim injunction application cannot be seen as an inviolable rule. SpicyIP intern Tejaswini Kaushal writes on this clarification by the Division Bench. Tejaswini is a 3rd-year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow. She is keenly interested in Intellectual Property Law, Technology Law, and Corporate Law. Her previous posts can be accessed here. Tejaswini KaushalAn update on the jurisprudence established in the Dabur v. Emami order (previously covered here) has recently come up from the Delhi High Court’s side. The court’s take in Emami, which was expeditiously reinforced in the Silvermaple v. Ajay Dubey case, established that granting an opportunity to the defendant to file a response is essential before granting an ad interim injunction. However, a qualification has been added to this order’s application in the order by the Division Bench (DB) consisting of J. Yashwant Varma and J. Dharmesh Sharma, dated 11 October 2023 in Hulm Entertainment Pvt Ltd & Ors. v. SBN Gaming Network Private Limited & Ors.The court clarified that the Emami order did not set an inviolable rule against issuing such injunctions. Rather, it has allowed for consideration of ad interim or ex parte reliefs based on the specific circumstances of each case. It further illustrated that situations like counterfeiting, the sale of spurious drugs, and harm to public or commercial interests might justify such injunctions. Holding the Single Judge’s interpretation of the Emami order as misconstrued, the court overturned the previous order and sent the injunction application back to the Single Judge for a fresh evaluation. The process of allowing the right to be heard doesn’t diminish the evaluation of the plaintiff’s claim in any way but rather upholds the fundamental purpose of injunction orders — maintaining fairness. However, ad interim injunctions hold separate importance in the litigation process, especially when the other party just doesn’t show up, regardless of intimations. This happens rather frequently, for instance, in (genuine) cases concerning counterfeit goods and is bound to affect plaintiffs adversely. In such situations, the new add-on in this order may be helpful as long as it’s clearly understood to be the “exception” and not the rule. Moreover, rather than merely giving examples of the types of situations like counterfeiting or spurious drugs, it would have been helpful for the DB to have mentioned the legal situations, such as a party not showing up despite notice, or other relevant circumstances, where the court can exercise its discretion in favor of granting ad interim injunctions. Hence, while the court has refused to accept the Emami order’s overarching application, it is still hoped that the court will continue to hold the Emami jurisprudence in high regard while dealing with matters of ad interim injunctions and maintain its strict applicability in cases where no circumstances of immediate ad interim injunctions are explicit."

    "data": "Recently, on September 15, the Delhi High Court set aside an order from the Indian Patent Office rejecting the patent application on the basis of the old CRI Guidelines, 2016. This decision of the court in Raytheon Company v. Controller General of Patents and Designs, thus opens the pandora box around the mandate within Section 3(k) and its interpretation under the revised 2017 CRI Guidelines, writes SpicyIP intern Yogesh Byadwal in this post. Yogesh is a 3rd year B.A. LL.B. (Hons.) student at National Law School of India University, Bengaluru. He is interested in IP Law, Constitutional Law and Criminal Law. His previous post can be accessed here. Yogesh Byadwal In Raytheon Company v. Controller General of Patents and Designs, Delhi HC made important observations regarding Sec. 3(k) of The Patents Act, 1970. The court was deciding an appeal preferred by the appellant against refusal of ‘grant of patent’ by the Patent office. The Appellant requested patent for their software titled ‘Scheduling in a High-Performance Computing System’. They argued that the Controller wrongly relied on Computer Related Invention Guidelines (CRI) Guidelines of 2016 instead of the updated CRI Guidelines of 2017 in arriving at their decision. Further, appellants argued, relying on the 2017 guidelines, that their subject patent application provided ‘technical advancement’ and ‘technical contribution’ by reducing time requirements typically associated with scheduling a job for execution at a High Performing Computing (HPC) system. On the other hand, the Respondents argued that the subject patent application consists primarily of software and not a novel hardware and therefore, it is excluded from the grant of patent u/s. 3(k). In this post, I will be analysing the reasoning employed in this case by the court and why I feel the judgement proceeds on an erroneous basis. I will critique the judgement in light of Sec. 3(k) of the Patents Act to expose the straining effect thereof on the express provision of the law.The court, agreeing with the contention of the appellant, observes that the patent office was in error by following the inapplicable 2016 CRI Guidelines. Relying on Ferid Allani and Microsoft Tech. Licensing, LLC, court holds that the novel hardware standard in the 2016 CRI Guidelines has been replaced by the 2017 CRI Guidelines, and, therefore, the requirement of novel hardware no longer has any basis in law. According to the latter, the patent office has to examine if there is a technical contribution or as to what is the technical effect generated by the invention as claimed. The Court observed- “computer program patent are patentable so long as it involves a technical advancement and provides a technical solution to a technical problem and has an improved technical effect on the underlying software.” In other words, there is no absolute bar on purely software-based patent claims. The court, as a result, remanded the matter back for redetermination by the Controller relying upon the 2017 guidelines without novel hardware requirement.In order to fully understand the reasoning, I will try to trace the evolving interpretation of Sec. 3(k), especially regarding computer-related invention(CRI).Sec. 3(k) of The Patents Act, 1970 reads as:3.What are not inventions- The following are not inventions within the meaning of this Act,-*******(k) mathematical or business method or a computer programme per se;Sec. 3(k), simply put, lays down that the above are excluded from being Patented. The section itself is pretty unclear and vague. Therefore, there have been various amendments by the legislature and guidelines from the Patent office to fill the gaps in Sec. 3(k). These developments have been extensively discussed here. However, the ping-ponging interpretation of the section has been hotly contested over the years. As regards software programme, the debate has revolved around whether purely software-programs can be patented provided they fulfill certain conditions or does it need to accompanied by a novel hardware requirement. For our discussion, we will focus on 3 specific guidelines-The 2013 guidelines had laid down the requirement of ‘novel hardware’ in deciding whether a CRI was patentable. The CRI would be excluded u/s. 3(k) if it was accompanied by a General Purpose Machine. Another set of CRI Guidelines in 2016 reiterated the requirement of a novel hardware in conjunction with a computer program (software) when a method claims qua a new computer program in combination with the hardware are being claimed. However, in light of heavy criticism, guidelines were again released in 2017 which diluted the exclusion under Sec. 3(k). It removed the ‘novel hardware’ requirement and stated that computer program as such are not patentable except inventions that involve a technical contribution or effect, beyond the program itself, which may be patentable. The 2019 Manual (here) further helps in defining terms such as “Technical Problem”, “Technical Contribution or effect”, and ”Technical advantage” used in the 2017 guidelines.Delhi HC in Microsoft Tech. Licensing, LLC v. Controller General of Patents and Designs recently sought to settle the position regarding the patentability of CRI. It observed that the insertion of words ‘per se’ means that “computer programs as such” are non-patentable. However, if a computer program is used in conjunction with a hardware or results in a technical effect/solves a technical problem, it may be eligible for patent protection. According to the court, the focus in the 2017 CRI guidelines appears to be on substance over forms and claims. The holding of the judgement as regards Sec. 3(k) is:“If a computer-based invention provides a technical effect or contribution, it may still be patentable. The technical effect or contribution can be demonstrated by showing that the invention solves a technical problem, enhances a technical process, or has some other technical benefit. The mere fact that an invention involves a mathematical or computer-based method does not automatically exclude it from being patentable. The invention can still satisfy the patentability requirements, including the requirement for a technical effect or contribution, to be eligible for patent protection. In other words, method claims in computer program patents may be patentable if it involves a technical advancement and provides a technical solution to a technical problem and has an improved technical effect on the underlying software….An invention should not be deemed a computer program per se merely because it involves algorithms and computer-executable instructions.”Another judgement of the Delhi HC in Ferid Allen v. UOI, on CRI, held:“If the invention demonstrates a ‘technical effect’ or a ‘technical contribution’ it is patentable even though it may be based on a computer program…. The bar on patenting is in respect of ‘computer programs per se….’ and not all inventions based on computer programs…. “The words ‘per se’ were incorporated so as to ensure that genuine inventions which are developed, based on computer programs are not refused patents.”Ferid Allen, on CRI Guidelines, observed- “they explain the principles that have to be applied by the examiner, and are expected to assist the examiner in dealing with applications, especially, those which involve complex subject matter.” Therefore, according to the court, “patent application deserves to be considered in the context of settled judicial precedents which have now laid down the interpretation of Section 3(k), the Guidelines and other material including the legislative material.”However, these observations raise certain important questions- What probative value can be assigned to Guidelines? Can these guidelines be allowed to trump the letter of law? What should the courts do in case of conflict between the two?The legal nature and effect of CRI guidelines were discussed by Sukarm in another post. He rightly observes -“they are not any form of legislation, delegated or otherwise… Since these guidelines have been explicitly clarified to not constitute rule making, it is evident that they are not binding on the court, or even the patent offices. At best, they are tools for interpretation.” On conflict with express provisions of the Act, he writes- “paragraph 1.5 explicitly mentions that ‘these guidelines do not constitute rule making’ and that in case of any conflict, ‘the provisions of the Act and Rules will prevail over these guidelines.’Are there any conflicts between Sec. 3(k) of the Patent Act and CRI Guidelines?Here, Sukarm argues that the language of 3(k) never intended computer programmes themselves to be patentable which is clearly in conflict with the CRI 2017 guidelines. I agree with Sukarm in his arguments raised as to the patent conflict between the language of the law and CRI guidelines which, at best, are aids of interpretation.It is clear that a chasm exists between what the law allows and the extent to which the guidelines stretch the interpretation thereof. In this post, Swaraj showcases how the JPC report in 2001 clarified that computer programs as such could never be granted patents by themselves. In fact, when the Patent offices started to give ‘software patents’ in 2008, there were various debates around the validity of such an interpretation with the 88th Parliamentary standing committee(here) noting that this was wholly contradictory to the language of the Act. From 2011 to 2017, there have been numerous flip-flops as to whether the exclusion of computer software u/s. 3(k) is a broad or narrow. The constant proposal of and retraction from novel hardware requirements in these guidelines provides enough evidence that the language of 3(k) needs to be further clarified by the legislature. The guidelines are not only contradictory with the express provisions and intentions of the law but also with each other. In this situation, it is best to be cautious about relying on the same for deciding a patent claim.The judgement in Microsoft Tech. Licensing, LLC, therefore, in my opinion wrongly prefers the 2017 CRI guidelines to the 2016 guidelines. The latter by mandating a ‘novel hardware requirement’ for patent claims with respect to computer programs is more in tune with the language and intent behind Sec. 3(k). The present case, Raytheon Company, makes a similar mistake by relying on the Microsoft case. It affirms the position that ‘computer programs’ as such are patentable provided they fulfill the conditions of overcoming a ‘Technical Problem’ by going beyond it through a ‘technical contribution or advancement’.There is no mention of such conditions either in the language of the law or statement of objects and reasons. The evolving trajectory of Sec. 3(k) through a legislative prism nowhere supports this interpretation which further strains the words of the law. The interpretation placed dilutes the exclusion of the law which goes against the objective of the lawmakers. 2016 guidelines, on the other hand, broaden the exclusion, which, on perusal of the legislative history seems more in line with the language and intent.Going by the recent call for comments on all guidelines and manuals, the Patent Office may be currently framing another set of amendments or even guidelines and manuals qua Sec. 3(k). As laid down herein, it is important to strike a note of caution. The concerned authorities must ensure that any clarification which is supposed to aid in the interpretation of a particular provision must conform with the express provisions of the law and remain closer to the intent of the law. Additionally, the court, before preferring a particular interpretation must ensure to strike a balance between protecting the rights of inventors and promoting the public interest and social welfare. A cautious approach in this regard helps maintain internal consistency within the system."

    "data": "We are pleased to announce that registration for the free Certificate Course in Application of Intellectual Property Rights for Startups and Entrepreneurship is currently open. The course is supported by Texas A&M University School of Law and will be delivered in-person at the Centre for Technology and Law, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar on November 22 and 23. The instructors for the course are Prof. Srividhya Ragavan and Swaraj Paul Barooah. For further details please see their call for participation below. According to the Economic Survey Report 2022-23, start-ups in India, as recognised by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), have risen from a mere 452 in 2016 to an impressive 84,012 in 2022, a staggering 18,587% jump in a short span of 6 years! This exponential growth in entrepreneurial activities in India is being led by tech-based start-ups. As per a NASSCOM report, India added a whopping over 1,300 active tech start-ups in the year 2022, taking the total tally of such start-ups to approx. 26,000, accounting for 31% of the overall start-up ecosystem in India! This ever-rising rate of entrepreneurship in India is being fuelled by her gigantic population of 1.43 billion people, accounting for 17.76% of world’s overall human population, second to none in terms of quantum of human resources. India’s youthful population, which has a median age of 28.2 years, one of the lowest in the world, offers her a rare advantage of a demographic dividend, boosted by an unprecedented bulge in her working age population.Here lies the role and significance of start-ups in India, attested by the fact that in the year 2022 alone, the 84,012 start-ups recognised by DPIIT have created 9+ lakh jobs with an increase of 64% over last year! Entrepreneurs – technologically armed, legally aware, financially shrewd, managerially efficient, and enthused with a patriotic zeal to create dignified jobs for a rising India – can make a big impact on the Indian economy. The digital age in which we live has unleashed a new band of entrepreneurs who leverage technology and know-how of fundamental and computer sciences to generate novel and disruptive entrepreneurial ideas. These “techno-entrepreneurs” are not just building new enterprises with exponentially rising revenues but also creating employment opportunities for millions. At the core of these tech-start-ups lie entrepreneurial ideas that are deeply rooted in advancements in science and technology. Intellectual Property Rights (“IPR”) law empowers such techno-entrepreneurs to protect their ideas and inventions from misappropriation and encroachment by others, and thereby, enables them to unlock the true potential value of their intellectual property.Intellectual properties are the manifestation of digital revolution that fuels 21st century technologically-driven economies. These are intangible creations of human mind that promise a stable stream of revenue to their creators. These intellectual properties are “assets” that have a measurable economic value in terms of their intrinsic worth and are capable of commercial exploitation. As owners of their intellect, inventors of intellectual properties have a natural right to exclusively commercialise the products of their minds. This liberty to benefit from one’s intellectual creation gives rise to a bundle of rights related to intellectual property, including, Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, Geographical Indications, among others.The 21st century India relies on inventions, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of the human mind to create employment for her burgeoning youth population and IPR law ensures that the goal is gainfully achieved. Studying IPR law empowers Entrepreneurs to protect and promote their innovation, invention and creations. Understanding IPR law enables “legally aware entrepreneurs/techno-entrepreneurs” to navigate these complex transactions and negotiate favourably. Neglect of IPR law can lead to unintentional infringement, resulting in costly legal disputes. Nevertheless, awareness about dispute settlement strategies can minimise the economic and legal costs of ignoring IPR law.Designed primarily to cater to the entrepreneurial zeal of engineering and management students, this one and a half-day program provides an invaluable foundation in the principles, practices, and significance of IPR to entrepreneurship and start-up enthusiasts. Participants will delve into the significance of IPR for entrepreneurship, exploring the various forms of IPRs that are relevant for entrepreneurial ventures, while gaining practical insights into the strategies, processes, and legal aspects that underpin Patent, Copyright and Trademark protection and enforcement. The course is being supported by Texas A&M University School of Law.The participants of the course can expect the following learning outcomes at the conclusion of the course:The course will be delivered in-person at the Centre for Technology and Law, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, on November 22 and 23, 2023.

    "data": "On February 1, 2023 the Zero Draft of the WHO’s proposed Pandemic Prevention, Preparedness and Response Accord was published by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body. Bringing us up to date with the key aspects of the accord and the current stage of negotiations, we are pleased to bring to you a guest post by SpicyIP intern Arnav Laroia. Arnav is a second-year law student at West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences, Kolkata. He is interested in understanding and advocating for the complexities of intellectual property law, with a focus on the intersection of innovation, legal frameworks, and creative expression within the modern landscape. Arnav LaroiaOne significant international effort aimed at promoting global agreement to enhance reaction and readiness in the face of pandemic threats is the Pandemic Preparedness Accord. Members of the World Health Organisation (WHO) have suggested an instrument (“convention, agreement or other international agreement”) that seeks to provide a framework for state-to-state cooperation and the advancement of a comprehensive plan in order to strengthen global readiness, allowing countries to be more resilient against future pandemics that incorporates all governmental branches and the general public in light of the recent COVID pandemic.The failures during the COVID pandemic were multifaceted, involving inadequate global coordination, underfunded health systems, and challenges in implementing measures effectively. Moreover, the failures of the WTO to serve as a unifying body for a response to the COVID pandemic have been well documented on the blog recently (for eg here). The International Health Regulations (IHR) were not fully utilised due to countries’ reluctance to comply, fear of economic repercussions, and the lack of enforcement mechanisms. Issues such as delayed information sharing, political tensions impacting collaboration, and prioritising national interests over global cooperation contributed to the failure to effectively implement the IHR, hampering a unified response. Therefore, the need for the Pandemic Accord arose due to the lack of comprehensive global response frameworks, urging a collective commitment to prevent, prepare for, and respond to future health crises, thereby filling the gaps in international cooperation and preparedness.The agreement’s main objectives are to improve national, regional, and global capacities, ensure that healthcare is accessible to everyone, and promote readiness for future pandemics. The process includes diplomatic talks between different countries with the goal of creating a major international agreement that ensures improved collaboration and preparedness in the event of any pandemics in the future. It is still unclear if the 194 WHO member nations will be able to reach a consensus on a pandemic accord that would have any real influence, given the difficult and sensitive subjects being discussed. Due to the ongoing slow progress in the negotiations between member countries, uncertainties have been raised regarding the conclusion of the negotiations by the 77th World Health Assembly in May 2024.The negotiations and foundation for the pandemic accord involved countries within the World Health Organisation (WHO). Nations like Argentina, Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Iran, Pakistan, Namibia, and South Africa advocated for specific language such as “Common But Differentiated Responsibility” (CBDR), aiming to address the varying needs and responsibilities of different nations. Additionally, countries like Fiji played a role in these discussions, emphasizing different perspectives on the accord. Up until now, the six nations chosen to spearhead the process—South Africa, the Netherlands, Japan, Brazil, Thailand, and Egypt (one from each region)—have used three separate draft documents from the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body Bureau (INB Bureau) as the foundation for the negotiations.On February 1, 2023, the zero draft of the accord was published by the Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, and negotiations began on March 3, 2023. Countries set out the way forward for continued negotiations on the global accord with meetings in June, September, and October 2023. The negotiation text proposal provided by the Bureau on October 16 will be discussed during the 7th meeting of the INB, which takes place on November 6–10 and December 4–6. It seems that the members want a review of the text prior to even acknowledging it as a text for negotiation in order to maintain their stance that the proposal for negotiation text would be without prejudice to the right of any member state to present textual proposals and to the status of the compilation document.Evidence of the urgent need to alter the global health security framework is the main area of attention. However, there are still significant differences on crucial issues. Benefit sharing and pathogens are two of them. When disease outbreaks occur, researchers may quickly find microorganisms, which enables the creation of medical countermeasures such as vaccinations as soon as feasible. The main issues regarding equity in pandemic accords revolve around the unequal distribution of resources, access to healthcare, and fair treatment during health emergencies like the COVID pandemic. Concerns have been raised about weakening equity clauses in the latest drafts of pandemic accords, possibly diminishing the focus on ensuring fairness and equal access to healthcare during global health emergencies.Some of the primary elements of the previous draft of the pandemic accord are still included in the most current proposal, including time-bound waivers of intellectual property (IP) rights and advantages for nations that exchange information on hazardous microorganisms. However, during discussions, these two topics have been the main points of disagreement. In order to manufacture pandemic-related goods “during a pandemic,” the draft asks the nations and regional organisations that will be bound by the agreement to commit to agree upon, within the framework of relevant institutions, time-bound waivers of intellectual property rights. Additionally, it encourages patent holders to temporarily waive or manage, as appropriate, payment royalties made by developing country manufacturers. According to the wording, people who have benefited from public financing for the creation of items connected to pandemics would need to comply “as appropriate.”Nevertheless, the pharmaceutical sector is adamantly against an IP waiver, claiming that by discouraging innovation, it would impede future pandemic responses. They have long maintained that the COVID-19 vaccination disparity was caused by trade and export restrictions. Furthermore, major Western countries have adopted a stance on the IP waiver that is somewhat comparable to this. A pandemic agreement with “major limitations” on intellectual property (IP) rights protection, according to German Health Minister Karl Lauterbach, “will not fly” for Germany and the majority of its fellow European Union (EU) members, who also asserted that intellectual property security is necessary in order to invest in vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and other related fields. Several of the biggest pharmaceutical corporations in the world are based in both Europe and the US, and they oppose significant changes to intellectual property rights under a pandemic accord. Another issue, mostly brought up by European countries, is the relinquishing of executive power to the accord. They argue that it needs to be made very clear that, in the event of a pandemic, all of the signatory nations’ full executive power will not be restricted or infringed upon and that the executive power will always remain within the nations where the action occurs.The WHO Member States are leading an international effort to improve global preparation and equality in responding to pandemics, known as the pandemic preparedness pact. This work is motivated by the lessons learned during the COVID-19 pandemic. With an eye towards a comprehensive and inclusive strategy for pandemic preparation and response, the INB was an important contributor in the writing and negotiation of this important agreement. Recent progress has shown that, despite the numerous informal and formal discussions surrounding the pandemic accord, agreement on issues such as the two main points of contention—time-bound waivers of intellectual property (IP) rights and equitable distribution—as well as advantages for nations that exchange information about potentially dangerous pathogens, is still (likely) a long way off.There are huge gaps between high- and low-income nations. High-income countries are reluctant to sign binding obligations to share lifesaving resources. But low-income countries demand that they have a right to fair and affordable access to vaccines and drugs. It is clear that rapid reporting, sharing pathogen samples and genomic sequence data, and sharing scientific and epidemiologic information are vital for global health. It is equally clear that a system where all the benefits go to high-income countries and lower-income countries are left behind cannot be tolerated. The below-stated suggestions are oriented towards addressing equity concerns and ensuring no one is left behind in the way the world deals with major health threats in the future. The recommendations focus on ensuring fair vaccine distribution, healthcare access, and resources, targeting underserved populations. These recommendations have been identified and compiled from various sources. These are as follows:"

    "data": "[This post has been authored by SpicyIP intern Rohan Srivastava. Rohan is a Second Year student at National Law School Of India University and has a keen interest in IPR and Technology Law.]The recent increase in COVID-19 cases in India comes as a Deja Vu, reminiscent of the predicament India and the world were in 2 years ago. While the spike should not be a cause of concern owing to a proper vaccination run (also see here for the number of doses administered), elsewhere, experts and delegates are still engaged in negotiations over a possible extension of the TRIPS waiver to medical supplies and pharmaceuticals products. The TRIPS waiver, which became a hot topic for debates around multilateralism from October 2020, brought to the forefront the international community’s inaction and paralysis in the face of a global crisis of unprecedented scale. The fact that the negotiations recently extended the deadline for deciding on the waiver, almost a year after the medical emergency was subdued, is itself a testament to how time taking and inefficient the waiver fiasco has ended up being. This post will seek to look back at the controversy surrounding the waiver and reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight. In doing so, this post shall uncover the handicaps in seeking the TRIPS waiver, both internally in the WTO decision-making process and problems with the idea of a waiver as a way out of the crisis. This piece will then conclude with certain considerations that must be kept in mind for the future.The Pandemic was not the first time that the WTO’s inefficient decision-making process came to the forefront. (For example- Trade Law enthusiasts will recall the painstakingly long Doha Round of Negotiations, which were the 9th round of negotiations and the first since the WTO was established.) Part of the reason behind the WTO’s inefficient decision-making is its consensus-based model. Consensus, at WTO, means the lack of sustained opposition i.e. a decision is made when no member formally objects to it. (In the context of the TRIPS waiver, the consensus-based decision-making model can be seen in Article IX: 3 (1) of the Marrakesh agreement r/w Footnote 1.)Thus, decision-making at the WTO requires lobbying each and every member of the Organization in support, which often ends up being a zero-sum game for the members. While there is certainly merit in having this consensus-based approach, insofar as it is more democratic and allows due consideration to be given to all viewpoints, the pandemic has clearly exposed that the same rationale may be turned on its head during a medical health emergency. Already, there has been a lot of global north and global south contention over the availability of essential medicines at the time of crisis. For instance, the HIV/AIDS crisis and the surrounding access to medicines issue that started off in 2001 and fructified into an amendment only in 2017 (see here). The same was reflected in the context of TRIPS COVID-19 Vaccine waiver as well, where first a broad waiver was proposed by the member countries (see here and here) and after the subsequently revised proposals (see here), the existing waiver, which applies only on vaccines, was accepted. These instances show how the consensus-based approach at the WTO, which can be argued to protect the interests of the less influential countries, can also work against them when decision-making is required to be made in emergencies where time is of the essence. This is especially significant since the developing countries have for long been in majority in the WTO but still have not had their say, for the self-interests of a handful of developed nations (read here and here). What is even more ironic is that despite the strong resistance by the developed nations in the negotiation process which led to further delays in reaching a conclusive and timely waiver, the ministerial council’s final decision did not even concern the developed nations as they were not eligible members as per the document. What is to be kept in mind is that it was ultimately the developing countries that had to face the brunt of being deprived of their IP Protection. (Find more on this here.) Looking at the October 2020 draft, proponents claimed that a waiver is necessary to ensure proper access because the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS such as compulsory licensing etc. are not feasible in an emergency such as the pandemic. However, proponent countries themselves actively refused from utilising already existing flexibilities first to reach the above assertion. For instance, the Indian Supreme Court even questioned the Indian government’s reluctance to utilise compulsory licensing provisions in domestic law on precisely this point, and yet there was no action on this front. (Read more on this here) The lack of an efficient internal decision-making process at the WTO and wide disagreements over the desirability of a waiver raises the question of whether it is the appropriate recourse at times of crisis or if the global community would do better to envisage alternative mechanisms in the future. The opponents of the waiver, who were mostly the developed nations housing the major pharmaceutical manufacturers, argued that the October 2020 waiver will take away the incentive to innovate the cure for the pandemic. They instead argued that the members should utilize the flexibilities incorporated within the TRIPS in order to cater to the rising need for essential commodities. Even the final ministerial decision was an iteration of the opponent’s sentiment only, in so far as it did not technically waive off any IPR protections under the TRIPS but instead clarified the existing flexibilities. Looking at the TRIPS agreement, one can see that it is cognizant of the need to balance such social imperatives with the protection of IPR, and has incorporated relevant structural features. For instance, Article 7 provides that the ‘protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare’ while Article 8 states that Members ‘may, in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health … provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of the Agreement’. The TRIPS agreement makes it clear that Members are free to pursue legitimate public policy objectives. Furthermore, despite claims to the contrary, TRIPS flexibilities, including mandatory licensure, pharmaceutical transition measures, parallel importation, and research exceptions, have all been used and successfully demonstrated. For instance, a study by Ellen t’Hoen et al on the use of TRIPS flexibilities found that 89 countries used TRIPS flexibilities 176 times between 2001 and 2016, with over half of those uses (79.5%) involving Compulsory license, public noncommercial use, and LDC pharmaceutical transition measure. Thus, one would not be wrong to think that a lot of crucial time wasted in the negotiations at the time of the crisis could have been saved, had the proponents focussed more on aggressively pursuing the existing options or seeking clarification regarding the same for greater certainty, especially given that this was what was eventually agreed to instead of having a blanket waiver. It is undoubtedly true that a global crisis of such a magnitude would require multilateral cooperation and collective initiatives, the question however is what could be achieved by a patent waiver when most LDC countries lack the required infrastructure capabilities to actually engage in vaccine manufacture. Looking at a chart of key vaccine developing countries (here) one can see that there are only a handful of developing countries with vaccine manufacturing prowess. Assuming the broader waiver proposal was accepted, the opponents (housing the majority of vaccine developers) could still have refused to apply the same in their countries, (this intent is evident from the outcome waiver document that expressly exempts the developed countries from the ambit of its application). And thus, the only benefit that would have occurred out of the broad waiver would have been the flexibility to not be sued for non-consensual use of the IP involved in the production of the vaccines, by the manufacturers located in these developing- broad waiver proponent countries. However, it is pertinent to note, that if the ultimate benefit of the waiver would have been the freedom from being sued for non-consensual use of the underlying IP, then as argued above, TRIPS already caters to it under Article 73 (b)(iii), and thus making the whole exercise largely a rut. It is also interesting to note that the developed countries which came to the table in favour of the TRIPS waiver in the name of multilateral cooperation for assuring equitable access to vaccines, were at the same time also doing lip service to their commitments by signing bulky procurement orders with multiple vaccine manufacturers to keep their eggs in several baskets. These orders were also often in excess of the vaccine requirement of the particular country, at a time when vaccine availability across the world was uncertain. The TRIPS negotiation allowed vaccine nationalism to maintain face at the international fora as is also evident from the final ministerial decision which limited the applicability to the developing countries and LDCs. (Refer here) It thus becomes evident that a TRIPS waiver cannot be seen as a ready response that will act as a panacea to the woes of vaccine availability during times of crisis. With regards to the internal process in the WTO, the pandemic has made it clear that WTO cannot be expected to make ad-hoc decisions due to the consensus requirements given that differing considerations, such as the impact on innovation etc. are involved in such a decision. The only hope on the IPR front would be for the WTO to create structural safeguards that can aid in times of such crisis and clarify such flexibilities. Given that the utility of a waiver itself is also under question, the WTO also needs to focus more on ensuring the availability of vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and treatment options by continuing its efforts to identify and reduce barriers to trade, to ensure that states which do not have the institutional capacity to make use of the waiver are not left out. One instance of such a barrier is regulatory bottlenecks which impeded the speedy dispersal of vaccines globally. (Read more on this here and here) In addition to this, there have also been criticisms against the TRIPS framework for being unable to protect the interest of developing nations and encouraging the growth of technology in the LDCs. So far, TRIPS has only ensured greater IP protection to technology-generating countries and there has been no trickle-down or transfer of technology from the higher-income countries to the LDCs, despite having provisions urging the same. It is imperative that WHO, which is better suited for responding to a global health crisis, steps up to the game for ensuring equitable access to vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other medical aid through multilateral cooperation. Much of the international cooperation in such efforts will also depend upon the fate of the global treaty for future pandemic emergencies under the WHO which is currently under negotiations. The main purpose of the initiative is to ensure early detection and prevention of future pandemics, including a stronger international health framework within the WHO that would attempt to ensure universal and equitable access to medical solutions. It is also pertinent to note that the treaty includes provisions for timely waiver of IP protection so that there is no tussle at the time of crisis and valuable time and lives are not wasted (Article 7.4). However, as if the international community refuses to learn, the negotiations are again facing institutional concerns and are being done in a non-transparent manner (See Talha Burki’s statement on this media coverage here). This can potentially undermine trust in the process and history might again repeat itself with another deadlock over the differences between the developed and developing nations and over the fate of countless lives.Multilateral cooperation at times of global emergencies like the pandemic is understandably hard to come by given the pressing needs each member state has internally. The COVID-19 pandemic cannot be seen as a one-off event and it is widely predicted that as man taps more with nature it is likely that there may be a rise in the frequency of pandemics. Thus, it would do well if the international community sees the entire TRIPS waiver fiasco as a lesson on how things pan out practically in times of crisis and is able to come up with more practical and efficient mechanisms which would allow all states to acquire an equitable supply of vaccines despite the socio-economic inequalities across the borders.

Johnson & Johnson’s “Non-Enforcement” of Bedaquiline Patents: What has Actually been Gained? Overview of the S. 3 landscape on patenting biotechnology inventions in India IP Rights, Access, and WHO’s Pandemic Accord",
    "data": "It is critical for the government to be forward-thinking. The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, a government department, is reported to have provided INR 70 to 100 crores to Gennova Pharmaceuticals for its development of an mRNA vaccine for Covid. The mRNA technology is a versatile platform technology that has been heralded as a new era in vaccines. The platform used by Gennova (saRNA – self-amplifying RNA) overcomes storage / temperature issues that affected previous versions of mRNA vaccines. Unlike existing mRNA vaccines that need to be stored at very low temperatures, saRNA vaccines can be freeze-dried and stored at higher temperatures. Lower cost and freeze-drying would solve some major distribution problems.Significant public health benefits lie in the versatility of this platform. While currently used for Covid, trials are underway for its use to treat other diseases such as Zika, Zoster and Rabies. This platform technology has potential for use for several other infectious as well as non-infectious diseases including TB, malaria, dengue and possibly even cancer, auto-immune diseases, and diabetes. Given its versatility, it is not possible for one pharmaceutical company to explore the technology’s wide-ranging applications. True value can be unlocked only through widespread research, proper regulation and use. There is therefore a need to make the technology more accessible.Access to this technology is, however, at risk. The government has blanketly refused to disclose its collaboration agreement with Gennova. Prashant has challenged this refusal before the Delhi High Court. As per precedent decided in Navroz Mody v. Mumbai Port Trust, the government is obligated to disclose public-private partnership agreements.Locking up the collaboration agreement bodes badly for public health efforts. The public, scientists, researchers and other industry players, all of whom can contribute to effective use of this technology, are in the dark about intellectual property rights that surround it. Typically, collaboration agreements contain key details about the invention, scientific and manufacturing processes, intellectual property right ownership, research plans, collaborator rights, resource allocation etc. Therefore, the collaboration agreement may contain material information as to ownership of patents, trade secrets and other technology. And knowledge regarding ownership of intellectual property is the first step towards increasing its access.The government, through this collaboration agreement, may have in its hands very lucrative technological secrets. mRNA vaccines contain three main ingredients – mRNA, the lipids (that encase the mRNA) and sugars / stabilisers. The process of sequencing, making, mixing, purifying and combining each of these ingredients requires expert knowledge. Gennova that developed these mRNA-based vaccines, in collaboration with a US bio-tech company HDT, surely has the required expertise. Many of these processes can also be documented and drug regulatory approvals require their documentation. Through the collaboration agreement the government may also have access to these documents and consequently to the process of making mRNA vaccines. This is no small issue given the vast potential of this technology.While the collaboration agreement should definitely be disclosed, the government may have reason not to disclose trade secrets such as manufacturing processes to make and use the mRNA platform. ‘Trade secrets’ have a specific meaning under law. However, at this point it is unclear whether this information will qualify as trade secrets given the USD 950 million lawsuit against Gennova for trade secrecy theft pending in the US. To defend itself, it is possible that Gennova may argue that these processes do not qualify as ‘trade secrets’. In which case there will be no reason for the government to withhold this information from the public. Further, since the government funded Gennova’s efforts, it is significant for the public to understand the impact of this lawsuit on the government and government funds. All this will be known only if the collaboration agreement is disclosed. Separately, assuming that these are indeed trade secrets, instead of locking them up, the government should establish transparent processes to increase technology transfer. The government can do this by disseminating information to universities or private industries by facilitating technical cooperation. Given that the world at large is interested in the mRNA platform, these efforts will attract investments into India, increase industry uptake and increase innovation around this new technology. Mutually beneficial relationships with industry and researchers can be established through transparent and reasonable licensing agreements that can increase access to this technology. Instead of digging in its heels, the government should disclose the collaboration agreement and should pursue ways to increase access to technologies that can have significant public health benefits."

(for the responses received from the CIC see here, here and here) Prashant Reddy (who needs no introduction on this blog) filed several RTI requests covering public-private partnership arrangements related to the Covid 19 vaccines. He has challenged the blanket refusal by the government before the Delhi High Court. He is represented by lawyers Swathi Sukumar and Sai Vinod (also a former SpicyIP blogger).Since 2021 the Indian public has been made aware of the existence of several public-private arrangements related to the development and procurement of Covid 19 vaccines. For instance, the ICMR and the National Institute of Virology, two government bodies, collaborated with Bharat Biotech to develop a Covid 19 vaccine – Covaxin. The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council (BIRAC) also funded Gennova Pharmaceuticals and Bharat Biotech for their mRNA and intranasal vaccine candidates. Further, the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare placed purchase orders for several vaccines.Since then, the Indian public has raised several questions regarding the details of these arrangements. Many articles (e.g. here and here) have questioned the lack of transparency, intellectual property rights concerns, and the lack of information about the amount of taxpayer money that has gone into these arrangements. It is clear that the public, whose money is being used, wants to know the details. More so because a substantial amount of public funds and resources have been expended in this regard. For context, more than 36 crore doses of Covaxin have been administered in India. However, the government has refused to provide information regarding these arrangements.In an attempt to characterise this issue as an intellectual property rights issue (rather than a governance issue), the government has cited an exemption under Section 8(d) of the RTI Act to withhold information. The categories of records exempt under Section 8(d) are ‘commercial confidence, trade secrets or intellectual property, the disclosure of which would harm the competitive position of a third party.’ To be sure, this is not a blanket exemption. The competent authority can disclose even these categories of information if it is satisfied that ‘larger public interest warrants its disclosure’. Everything else aside, the arrangements in questions are not every day, ordinary arrangements. These arrangements relate to public authorities and a public purpose – developing vaccines to protect against Covid 19. Further, they arose out of and are inherently tied to a world-wide, deadly pandemic, an international health emergency, that the public is undoubtedly interested in. In fact, public disclosure of COVID-19 vaccine agreements is the global norm. The United States and the United Kingdom that collaborated with private companies to develop COVID-19 vaccines have released copies of their research and collaboration agreements under their Freedom of Information (FOI) laws with redactions. This by itself warrants disclosure and the government seems to have mischaracterised the issue at hand.Even otherwise, as argued in detail by Prashant in his petition, public-private agreements are subject to different treatment under the RTI Act. As per binding precedent, the Chief Information Commissioner (CIC) is obligated to disclose public-private partnership agreements (Navroz Mody vs. Mumbai Port Trust). Further, government bodies like ICMR and BIRAC are obligated under law (Section 4 of the RTI Act) to publish information relating to public-private partnerships (PPPs) on the internet. In 2013, the Department of Personnel and Training issued guidelines which instructed public authorities to disclose “all information” relating to PPPs voluntarily including documents generated in the course of implementation of the PPPs, all payments made under PPPs along with the purpose of the payments. The government has also argued that since the contracts are on-going they should not be made to disclose them. But the petitioner has cited several cases where high courts have allowed disclosures even where contracts were ongoing or still in operation.As highlighted by the petitioner, instead of a blanket refusal, the concerned authority should have perused the documents in order to establish whether they contain any information relating to ‘trade secrets’ or ‘commercial confidence’ or ‘intellectual property’ – all terms that have specific meaning under law.It seems difficult to beat the law and the logic in the petition. Interestingly, the government seems to be flustered by the petitioner’s strong case and is resorting to cheap tactics – personally attacking him for ‘acting against the interest of the nation’ instead of fighting the matter on its merits."

    "data": "Battle lines are being drawn in the fight over the lucrative mRNA vaccine technology used in certain Covid 19 vaccines. Moderna recently sued Pfizer alleging patent infringement of three out of eight patents that cover its Covid 19 vaccine (Spikevax).Moderna has supplied over 299 million doses of its Covid 19 vaccine to the United States and has, reportedly, lined up supply deals worth USD 35 billion through the end of 2022.Pfizer and BioNTech have supplied over 472 million doses of their COVID-19 vaccine (Comirnaty) for use in the United States. Pfizer recently announced that it expects an additional USD 32 billion in global revenues from Comirnaty.As reported, Moderna earned revenue of around USD 10 billion for its vaccine, and Pfizer earned around USD 22 billion, in just a year. Both companies have enjoyed windfall financial gain from the sale of their respective vaccines. The sales of these vaccines are likely to rank among the highest in a single year for any medical product in history.The sheer size of sales and revenue coupled with patent monopolies and the immense potential of the mRNA technology, makes both these entities King-like – rich, supreme and sometimes hypocritical.The tale of two kingsModernaStrikingly, the portrait that Moderna paints of itself is not one of a King but of a small, research-driven start-up in need of funding. Moderna’s patent infringement lawsuit is a revenue seeking activity since Moderna wants fair compensation but does not want to remove Comirnaty from the market.As claimed, fair compensation will allow it to invest in its leading mRNA platform. Moderna believes that this case will also ensure that next generation biotech startups don’t lose their ability to rely on the patent system.This David v. Goliath narrative is probably drawn up since Moderna has requested a jury trial. Some studies have shown that juries favour independent inventors / start-ups over bigger corporate defendants (e.g. Judge Kimberly Moore, Populism and Patents, NYU L.Rev).Moderna was set up in 2010 with its sole focus being mRNA technology. Moderna claims to be at the forefront of this technology having begun its research before the pandemic and before anyone had figured out how to make or use mRNA medicines successfully. And along the way it encountered several technical challenges which it successfully overcame.Moderna’s Spikevax is covered by eight patents, three of which have allegedly been infringed by Pfizer and BioNTech. The three patents cover novels ways through which Moderna stabilized the mRNA by modifying its chemical structure (to reduce immune response against mRNA itself); identified ways to optimise its mRNA platform; and developed new techniques for manufacturing on a large scale.These efforts include – replacing uridine in the mRNA molecule with 1-methylpseudouridine to reduce immune response against mRNA itself; and discovering that encoding a full-length coronavirus spike protein in a lipid nanoparticle formulation was highly effective at producing neutralizing antibodies to the coronavirus.Due to its focus on mRNA technology and research in this field, once the genomic sequence for SAR-CoV-2 was published, Moderna was able to produce its vaccine at a lightning-fast pace. Moderna had six mRNA candidates for infectious diseases in clinical trials by the time COVID-19 arrived.However, it must be kept in mind that Moderna was able to get the vaccine out so fast because of several other factors. As disclosed by KEI and The Intercept, the US government gave companies special authority to use another person’s technology, without permission, to produce Covid 19 vaccines. Moderna was one such company that was granted a compulsory license. Such relaxations were specifically aimed at speeding up the process of vaccine production. Easy for Moderna to now push for ‘licensing and not abrogating patents’. This issue is the center of controversy in two lawsuits filed against Moderna by Arbutus Biopharma Corp. and Alnylam Pharmaceuticals Inc. over the use of lipid nanoparticle technology in the mRNA vaccines.Its partnership with the NIH is also alluded to. However, patent ownership controversy with the NIH is a separate story (here and here).Pfizer and BioNTechUnlike Moderna, Pfizer and BioNTech started with as many as 20 vaccine candidates representing different mRNA constructs. Moderna claims that not all 20 infringed its patents but ultimately Pfizer and BioNTech decided to go ahead with the one that uses Moderna’s patented technology i.e. uses the same 1-methylpseudouridine chemical modification in a lipid nanoparticle formulation and contains mRNA encoding for the same full-length spike protein for SARS-CoV-2.It appears that BioNTech (another start-up founded by Dr. Sahin and Dr. Tureci) was focused on cancer treatments prior to the pandemic but was also looking into mRNA for cancer treatment.Further, Katalin Karikó whose scientific research has been acknowledged as foundational in RNA mediated immune activation research is associated with BioNTech. Together with Drew Weissman, she holds U.S. patents for the application of non-immunogenic, nucleoside-modified RNA.As reported, these patents have been licensed to both Moderna and BioNTech. BioNTech entered into a partnership with 173 year old Pfizer to commercialise its mRNA technology.Pfize and BioNTech also have patent infringement cases filed against them for their vaccine e.g. by CureVac, Alnylam Pharmaceuticals and Allele Biotechnology and Pharmaceuticals.The world their battlefieldWhile this patent battle is technically being fought in court rooms in Cambridge, MA and Düsseldorf, Germany, it could have worldwide implications.Moderna has pledged (again but this time it appears to be a pledge forever) never to “enforce patents for COVID-19 vaccines against companies manufacturing in or for the 92 low- and middle-income countries in the Gavi COVAX Advance Market Commitment (AMC), provided that the manufactured vaccines are solely for use in the AMC 92 countries.” This pledge becomes relevant for initiatives such as the WHO’s mRNA tech-transfer hub in South Africa. It appears that WHO asked Moderna and Pfizer and BioNTech to help teach researchers in low-and middle-income countries how to make their COVID-19 vaccines. However, neither of the companies responded so the WHO decided to go ahead anyway and replicated Moderna’s vaccine (relying on its older pledge). See here for implications on reneging on pledges in the patent context.Added to this, the fact remains that mRNA vaccine technology is a new era in vaccine science, one with immense potential even beyond Covid 19. Due to its effectiveness, potential for low-cost manufacturing, capacity for speedy development and safe administration, mRNA vaccines have been prophesied to be a promising alternative to conventional vaccine approaches. The facility to make mRNA can also be used for vaccines for different diseases making manufacturing flexible. See here for a brief overview of the science behind mRNA vaccines.The surest and easiest way for countries and companies to access this technology is to obtain a license from the technology owner. However, as is evident, ownership over this technology and its component parts is extremely fuzzy.When ownership is itself in dispute, the process of obtaining a license from either entity becomes a risky and expensive exercise.Some argue that neither Moderna nor BioNTech-Pfizer nor Curevac and others who are litigating this tech own the technology – it belongs to the world and is in public domain (here). Others argue that some of Moderna’s patent claims are over-broad and may be weakened due to prior art.Given the potential of this technology, it is hoped that this battle gets over sooner rather than later. Some suggest that a simplified inter partes review (before the USPTO rather than courts) is all that it would take which could result in a quick decision. However, given that this is a sport of kings, history shows that when billion-dollar biomedical inventions are involved, disputes drag on in courts for years.Thank you to Swaraj for his inputs!"

Clarification on Divisional Applications SpicyIP Tidbit: Advocate Faces Music for Concocting a Fake IPAB Order!",
    "data": "[This post has been co-authored with Swaraj and Nivrati Gupta. Nivrati is an IP lawyer based in Delhi and is a graduate of Institute of Law, Nirma University Ahmedabad. Long post ahead.]The Delhi High Court recently in Humans of Bombay v People of India granted an interim relief to ‘Humans of Bombay’ (HoB) by issuing a notice to ‘People of India’ (PoI) (both being social media pages) for alleged copyright infringement and ‘replication of HoB’s business model’ including the stories and thus creating an imitative platform. Though no injunction was granted against the HoB’s application for ad interim relief, the Court observed prima facie identical and similar photographs/images and “substantial imitation” by PoI, of HoB’s content. Despite all the commentary on the case, it seems to have largely escaped notice that some identical ‘photos’ shown in court, are actually screengrabs of videos that are substantially different from one another, both telling different stories, but which have a few overlapping (i.e. identical) video moments. (for instance, see here and here for the works which are presented as similar.) Prima facie, our best guess explanation for this would be that the person who actually shot the footage has sent different clippings (with some overlapping) to both platforms. Anyhow, before going further into that, let us first lay out the background a bit more clearly. HoB is a storytelling platform and claims operation since 2014 through its website, Instagram, and YouTube. PoI is another storytelling platform operating since 2019 (as per the linkedin page of its founder.) Both platforms share “feel good” stories about people fighting different adversities, and celebrating their achievements. The present suit is filed by HoB against PoI, alleging replication of a large number of images and videos, and replication of business models and stories shared by them. They further alleged that PoI was approaching similar subjects to create an imitative platform. In its order, the court has reproduced a comparison table submitted by HoB, that we have pasted below.We looked at one set of ‘images’ under dispute and interestingly, it seems like what, from the table replicated in the order first appears to be images, are actually videos/ reels where despite similar subjects, the shared story was expressed differently. For instance, one of the subjects has been portrayed by HoB as that of a dance teacher/ pole dancer who after facing personal adversities, decided to pursue her lifelong dream of becoming a dancer and how she was motivated by her partner to pick up pole dancing. On the other hand, PoI’s capture of her story focuses on overcoming her personal adversities, she did something that she was afraid of doing i.e. pursuing dance, and then further challenges she overcame after that, with her partner by her side. In both videos, there are clips/ snippets that are different and there are clips/ snippets which are similar and presumably seem to have been shot by the same person. [sidenote: we haven’t done a similar exercise for other sets, however, at least for this one set of claims, our observation seems relevant.]This opens up multiple questions concerning the ownership of the work, its expression, and whether there is any actual infringement or not? HoB has made many claims on infringement of their work and as per para 16 and 17 of the order, it seems like they are asserting ownership over images, videos, business model and exclusivity over approaching the same subject. Let’s look at these claims individually:- At the prima facie stage it’s unclear if copyright on these photographs and videos vests with HoB. As explained above, some of these videos express different “stories” despite being about the same subject with some overlap/ similar snippets. This raises an apprehension that the same person could have made these videos and submitted to different platforms for promotion. Looking at the HoB website, the careers page talks vaguely about a team “that’s interviewing people, clicking photos, managing finances, and making hires” but does not clearly state if all the photographs on their platform actually belong to them or if their page merely offers a platform for “storytelling.” While ownership cannot and should not be assumed, for the sake of proceeding with the argument, let’s say that the media put up by HoB are in fact owned by them, (perhaps as works for hire). The next question that comes up is that if there is any infringement by PoI by uploading contents about similar subjects? Here, applying the test prescribed by the Supreme Court in R.G. Anand v. Deluxe Films, the assessment of whether the two works are similar or not needs to be done in a holistic manner. Applying this test to the instance pointed above, it is clear that upon a holistic comparison, PoI’s expression is different from the expression of the “idea” by HoB. Whether this will be the case for the rest of the photographs or videos, will depend on an independent assessment of each work.The replication of the business model as being an infringement of copyright is a strange argument. First, because business models aren’t the subject matter of copyright, which is specifically limited to tangible expressions of creative “works”! So the question doesn’t even arise. And secondly, even “if” there was some way of protecting the business model (perhaps under some other ‘right’), surely HoB knows they are not the first one to use this business model of featuring stories of people’s life experiences, with photos. Regardless, the court order on the prima facie hearing of the matter does not appear to have made any reference to this question.Moving further, let’s say hypothetically if the claim of HoB is over the specific arrangement of work/photographs, followed by a story – would this have been a stronger argument for them? It is pertinent to cite the seminal discussion in R.G. Anand v. Deluxe Films again, which laid down the basic principles of copyrights by laying the idea-expression dichotomy (i.e., copyright exists not in an idea but only its expression). Therefore, any claim of copyright over the arrangement of scenes/ photos/ content would need to satisfy the originality standard and also prove that it is not a mere idea but an expression of an original and creative concept. Moreover, it would be a challenge to show that the arrangement in HoB’s stories, which involves photographs and accompanying anecdotes or captions, is inherently distinctive and not merely a combination of elements seen in other in countless other works depicting real-life experiences, including of course, Humans of New York (HoNY). In a query posed by the court regarding the jurisdiction of the Delhi High Court in this case, HoB responded that a number of subjects who were being interviewed by the Defendants are based out of Delhi. Though firstly, their name and early work suggest otherwise, their blog/ media handle currently does have people from Delhi as well as various other parts of the country. Upon looking at their website, one can see that the HoB operates from Mumbai and no reference of any sub-office situated in New Delhi. In light of this, it’s particularly interesting to see that the entity, located in Mumbai, is filing a suit in New Delhi instead of instituting the suit in the place of its office and where its founder resides. Legally, it may be straightforward enough for HoB to institute the suit in Delhi, but one can’t help but wonder if this is part of a legal strategy based upon an impression that the Delhi High Court is a better place to receive injunctions, than the Bombay High Court. There is of course no way of knowing if this was part of the actual reason for approaching the Delhi High Court. And the lack of court-related data anyway makes it difficult to say whether such an impression (if it did play a part) has any basis in reality or not. Nonetheless, it would be relevant to mention that in recent decades, the practice of forum shopping, where plaintiffs strategically select jurisdictions they believe are inclined to issue favorable rulings, has witnessed a surge. Such practice has also been taken note by the Supreme Court and Delhi High court in various instances. Discussion regarding territorial jurisdiction and recognition of forum shopping can be seen here, here, here, here and here.Needless to say, the reason that this case has garnered so much attention is not because the public is suddenly interested in copyright law, but because of the ‘human’ touch that so many, including us, have often been moved by, when reading the various “Humans of” stories over all these years, starting from HoNY onwards. The news of HoB suing PoI has also caught more attention because of ethical reasons the platform works for. The intention of HoB from their website seems to be to create a platform to “lend a voice to the voiceless” and “to tell stories, to connect strangers with the emotion of, You’re not alone”. But their act of bringing a suit against PoI who also seem to be working on a humane objective like them, shakes one’s confidence behind their expressions of altruism. And of course, most people know about the “roots” of the “Humans of” platforms, being HoNY. The arrangement of scenes/ photographs in a specific way followed by a story under the concept of “Humans of …” seem to have taken birth after the popularity of “Humans of New York” handle’. The expression of HoNY’s to “interview subjects in addition to photographing them” and to “include quotes and short stories from their lives” have gained them about 20 million followers from all over the world. On an online search, one can find umpteen pages working under the concept of “Humans of…”. To name a few, Humans of Amsterdam, Humans of Judaism, Humans of Pakistan, Humans of Kurdistan, Humans of Jabalpur, Humans of Kerala, We the Humans, People of Pride. Undoubtedly HoNY’s expression inspired people to open more such handles with a selfless motive of providing a glimpse of the heroes and warriors of daily lives on the internet. Coming to IP matters, while Brandon may not have had a copyright case on the “business model” for the same reasons HoB would not, it would have certainly been interesting if Brandon/HoNY had decided early on to enforce trademark or passing off claims against other similar platforms! Conversely, Brandon’s words in the past have shown that he enjoys that other such platforms are bringing the power of storytelling to so many places in the world. And indeed, in an interaction with Forbes the founder of HoB recorded her knowledge about HoNY’s existence and thought “…why something like this couldn’t exist in her own city.” Although, strangely, her statements saw a contrary stance in her TEDx talk where the founder mentioned the idea to be her own. (As a coincidental sidenote, TEDx talks are similar “business model replications” of the original TED talks, protected primarily through trademark licensing agreements) While on the legal front the court has issued notice to PoI, it is yet to be seen which way will the wind blow for the HoB. On a public relations front, the act of HoB considering the objective they work for seems to be uncalled for by many. The similarity or inspiration that the platform shares with HoNY certainly hasn’t helped its PR case either. This exacerbates further when one looks objectively at this situation considering the similarity this platform shares with HoNY. However, it seems that this may be a case for other organizations to watch and learn from. If HoB does own the copyright over the images/texts that were reproduced by PoI, then their legal claim may be fine, to the extent of copyright over those images. Nonetheless, the act itself, combined with the vague claims of rights over the business model, seems to have been perceived by many as being contrary to what they believed the platform(s) stood for. Whichever way this goes, it does teach a good lesson in understanding with more nuance, the role that IP rights can play in working ‘business models’. "

Learning from India’s Disastrous Experience in Protecting Itself against Biopiracy National Biodiversity Authority Imposing Upfront Monetary Payment as Benefit Sharing for Research Enabling the Use of People’s Biodiversity Registers within Environmental Impact Assessments",
    "data": "In 2018, an Office of Memorandum (Memo) was passed by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change directing the National Biodiversity Authority (NBA) to consider, on merit, the cases of entities/ persons, who were unaware of the provisions of the Biological Diversity Act and were using biological resources without approval. Thus, as explained by Adarsh here, this Memo enabled such entities to get an ex-post facto approval for past conduct. Emitting from this arrangement is the appeal in DCM Shriram v. National Biological Authority. Here, an appeal was filed before the National Green Tribunal against the NBA’s order which accepted the application and levied an upfront fee for past access of biological resources. The post will focus on the relevant issues that arise from the Order apart from the complexities from the Memorandum and the ABS Guidelines discussed in earlier posts by Prashant, Alphonsa and Adarsh. BackgroundDCM Shriram Ltd, (Appellant), a publicly listed company, was using biological resources mainly bitter gourd, watermelon and cotton for 14 years from 2004 to 2018 without seeking prior approval from the authorities. To comply with the provisions of the Act, the Appellant filed three separate applications to regularise its access to the biological resources for research purposes and received 2 Access and Benefit Sharing Agreements (one for research and another for commercial utilisation) for each application. Upon hearing the case, the NBA directed the Appellant to pay- (1) actual Access and Benefit Sharing (ABS) amount as fixed under the Act; (2) pay an upfront ABS amount as per the existing rates fixed by NBA for accessing biological resources irrespective of the outcome of the research; (3) directed to inform the areas from where biological resources were accessed and the activities for which they would use the ABS amount as per Section 27(2) of the Act. Furthermore, the benefit sharing rate which was fixed was the higher rate of 0.5% of the annual gross ex-factory sale of the product as provided under Regulation 4 of the Guidelines on Access to Biological Resources and Associated Knowledge and Benefit Sharing Regulations, 2014 (ABS Guidelines). Aggrieved by the Order, Appellant appealed to the National Green Tribunal (Tribunal). OrderIn the appeal, the Appellant claimed to be exempted from seeking prior approval because it was only accessing the biological resources for conventional breeding and thus should be exempted from the approval under Section 3 as per Regulation 17 of the ABS Guidelines. Rejecting the Appellant’s claim the Tribunal hinted towards non-maintainability of the appeal by stating that the appellant had filed for an approval and after obtaining an unfavourable order it moved the Tribunal without any “without prejudice” endorsements. Secondly on the claim of Appellant using bio-resources for conventional breeding, the Tribunal held that a seed company like the Appellant was using the resources with a commercial motive and since it conducted in-house trials and other R&D, the overall purpose would fall under research as per Section 2(m) of the Act. Reading Section 2(f) and Regulation 17 (d) of the ABS Guidelines, the Tribunal asserted that the exemption from obtaining authorization is only for conventional breeding and traditional practices to the extent that the accessed biological resources are used in agriculture, horticulture, poultry, dairy farming, animal husbandry or beekeeping in India. And since appellant is a company who produces seeds through conventional breeding methods with commercial intent, it cannot claim exemption. The Appellant also argued that conventional breeding contributes to increase in biodiversity and thus imposing prior approval on conventional breeding, done even for commercial gain, would go against the objective of the Act. The Tribunal disagreed with the above interpretation and after a long discussion on the purpose and objective of the Act, it held that the appellant cannot challenge the vires of the Act at this stage in an appeal after accepting the Act, filing the application and obtaining an adverse ruling by the NBA. Owing to the above reasons and finding merit behind how the rates for benefit sharing were determined, the Tribunal upheld the validity of the NBA order. AnalysisKey issues in the Order:In the initial pages of the Order (para 19), the Tribunal hinted that the appeal is non-maintainable since the Appellant had accessed the biological resources for an extensive period (14 years) without seeking prior approval. But later it went on to consider the claims made by the parties and passed an Order to the appeal. Ideally, the Tribunal should have considered doing more than passing a hint of non-maintainability of the appeal, perhaps making a decision on it!To comply with the law i.e. the Act and the ABS Guidelines, an entity/person has to enter into a benefit sharing agreement which acts as a grant of approval for access to the biological resources. The Appellant had entered into two such agreements, one for research purposes and the other for commercial utilisation. It is relevant to note that the Act defines ‘research’ and ‘commercial utilisation’ separately and treats them as distinct purposes. For the convenience of the readers, following are the definitions mentioned under Section 2 of the Act:….(m) “research” means study or systematic investigation of any biological resource or technological application, that uses biological systems, living organisms or derivatives thereof to make or modify products or processes for any use;……(f) “commercial utilisation” means end uses of biological resources for commercial utilisation such as drugs, industrial enzymes, food flavours, fragrance, cosmetics, emulsifiers, oleoresins, colours, extracts and genes used for improving crops and livestock through genetic intervention, but does not include conventional breeding or traditional practices in use in any agriculture, horticulture, poultry, dairy farming, animal husbandry or bee keeping;…The ABS Guidelines also have separate procedures to grant access and levy benefit sharing fee for research and commercial utilisation purposes. The Appellant claimed that it was accessing the biological resources purely for conventional breeding which is exempted from the meaning of commercial utilisation and therefore does not require prior approval. However, the Tribunal found that the Appellant mentioned research, plant breeding and in-house trials as purposes in its applications submitted under the Memo and therefore, held such purposes to fall under the umbrella of research, which limited to my understanding of the BDA issues, seems correct. But what is interesting is that the Tribunal, in paras 13 and 14 of the Order, held the purpose of access as “research leading to commercial utilisation” and “research activities with commercial motive”. As per my understanding, research has not been classified further into ‘research with commercial motive’ and ‘research with non-commercial motive’. Commercial utilisation as said before is a totally different purpose. Furthermore, as per Section 4 of the Act, the restriction on research vis a vis monetary consideration is with respect to transfer of research results to a non-citizen or a non-resident. The Tribunal’s use of such terminology to interpret the Provisions and determine the purpose of the Appellant is extremely confusing, more so, when it later on held that Appellant’s use of “conventional breeding would be slotted as research” in para 14 of the Order. Tribunal’s reasoning seems to be that Appellant’s research activity amounts to conventional breeding for commercial benefit but is not exempted from seeking prior approval as mentioned under Regulation 17(d) of ABS Guidelines and therefore, liable to pay an upfront fee. However, nowhere in the Act nor the ABS Guidelines have such a classification been given. The law presently distinguishes between research and conventional breeding and it begs the question if the Tribunal can take up such an interpretation. What is clear is that the law lacks clarity and the Tribunal lacks clarity of rationale! Normally, the Act requires only prior intimation from the Indian companies but in case an Indian company has “non-Indian participation in share capital or management” shall be required to seek prior approval. In the present case, the Tribunal had no deliberation on whether the Appellant has foreign management or not but found it liable to seek prior approval since it has a ‘global market’. ‘Global market’ is a broad term and could have several meanings. It is pertinent to note that the Tribunal did not specify the percentage of foreign shareholding or presence of any foreign management. Classifying the Appellant as an Indian company having foreign management/share capital on the basis of a presence of a global market is totally vague and unjustified. The duty of the Tribunal was to provide reasons for its conclusions and findings which it failed to do. Citing the disturbing ruling of Divya Pharmacy vs Union of India which found an Indian company to be liable to seek prior approval irrespective of the law as stated under Section 7, only increases the precedential value of an erroneous judgement!As per the recent Biological Diversity (Amendment) Act 2023 (2023 Amendment), an Indian company having foreign shareholdings means that the Indian company is controlled by a foreigner which is not the case here. Hence, the conclusion remains unreasonable. Finding support from the amendment and the clarificatory nature of Section 3, the Appellants moved to the Supreme Court which has put a stay on the Tribunal’s order. In the forthcoming development to the case one can hope for better clarity and understanding of application of Section 3 to Indian companies especially when NGT’s order is full of rhetoric, and meanders through seemingly unnecessary discussion.Thanks to Swaraj and Praharsh for their inputs."

Godabari Agro Machinery and Services India Pvt. Ltd. on 21 September, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The plaintiff alleged infringement of its suit patents in parts of combined harvester by the defendants. It alleged that the impugned products are imported by defendant no. 1 from China where they are manufactured by defendant no. 2 and 3. Considering the nature of the matter, the Delhi High Court appointed two academicians as experts to inspect the defendant’s machine/ impugned product. Defendant no. 3 also alleged that some of the corresponding suit patents have been invalidated in China, which the court asked them to place on the record in response to the application for an interim injunction.Shah Mayankkumar Bharatkumar vs Controller Of Patents And Designs … on 21 September, 2023 (Calcutta High Court)Aggrieved by the delay in disposing of the opposition, the plaintiff filed a revisional application.

The plaintiff argued that the defendant intentionally imitated their trademark “VBM”, causing market confusion. However, the defendant claimed their adoption of “VBM” was bonafide and its adoption was inspired by the holy trinity of “Vishnu Brahma and Mahesh.” Disregarding the defendant’s explanation as too facile to pass the legal muster and being unsupported by any corroborative documentary evidence, the Court concluded that the defendant’s actions were driven by bad faith and issued an injunction in favor of the plaintiff.Gnv Commodities Pvt Ltd vs Tykekart Technologies Pvt Ltd on 22 September, 2023 (Delhi High Court)The Delhi High Court allowed an appeal against the impugned order rejecting the request for interim injunction and remanded the matter back to the Trial Court for adjudication.

Assessing the previous order, the Delhi High Court clarified that the permission to sell pre-packaged products bearing the mark after procuring them from defendant no. 2 (as agreed in the settlement agreement) does not enable it to manufacture and sell products bearing the impugned marks. For the above reasons, the Court appointed a local commissioner to undertake an execution.

    "data": "In a “Jhakaas” (a slang for fantastic) news for the actor Anil Kapoor, Delhi High Court granted the actor an interim injunction against use/ misuse of his personality rights. While the development is being extensively discussed in the context of interaction between personality rights and deepfakes (see here, here, here and here), we are pleased to bring to you a guest post by Dr. (Prof.) Sunanda Bharti on the copyright aspect of the personality rights emitting from this order, reserving a separate post for later on other interesting issues like use/ misuse of personality rights via deepfakes and application of doctrine of first sale in the context of NFTs. Prof. Bharti is a Professor of Law at the Delhi University, and her previous posts can be accessed here.Dr. (Prof.) Sunanda BhartiThe recent interim order issued by the Delhi High Court in Anil Kapoor v. Simply Life India and Others CS(COMM) 652/2023 is full of curiosities for two reasons which I would comment upon in the following paragraphs, after introducing the context.Through the suit, Anil Kapoor, a celebrity actor of the Indian Film industry maintains that he has 1) Personality rights, including right to publicity; 2) Copyright in his dialogues and images, 3) Rights at common law like the right against passing off, dilution and unfair competition.I would like to focus my attention primarily to the copyright aspects of the personality rights so claimed. Personality rights are also known as image rights which aim to protect the commercial exploitation of myriad aspects of one’s psyche, identity and disposition. Meaning, if ‘X’ is a celebrity (say, a film star), his image rights are expected to create a safety net for him, allowing only him to control his image, name, and voice usage etc. Under Copyright Act, 1957 —most of these may come under the category of works in which copyright subsists. But, ‘safety’ against what? My submission is that it has to be safety against disparagement, dilution, advertising related passing off and offences of similar nature/gravity. It cannot be offered as an absolute right to control everything about one’s persona. Before bestowal, courts need to think, in appropriate cases, of rights of third parties, fair use covering mime, research/educational advancement, criticism and the like.Image rights are new to India, as to most of the world. Hence, their vindication is sporadic and operates on a sketchy and fragile ground. Two such fragilities are palpable in the interim order as well. To be specific and brief, the Plaintiff, Anil Kapoor maintains, amongst many other things, that some of the multiple defendants in the case have been selling his photographs (autographed or otherwise) without his consent. Brief research into the links/URL no 12 to 19 of infringing third parties mentioned in Annexure A of the interim order reveal that they are links to old-used postcards of the actor now being sold on eBay for a differential price. (See one example pasted below)The links, 12 to 19 lead to different old images of the actor as printed on physical old-school/vintage postcards. These defendants have been categorised in the suit as John Does.A postcard can be taken either as a literary work or an artistic work under sections 2(c) and 2(o) respectively of the Copyright Act, 1957. These vintage picture postcards, if original, are works in which copyright subsists (section 13 of the Copyright Act, 1957). It could vest in the printer/publisher of postcards (name mentioned on the back of the picture in postcards). In such a case, these postcards in the possession of a person ‘X’, who purchased/lawfully acquired these picture postcards in good faith, are just in the nature of books—one can own the product but not the copyright in the content. If this understanding holds, then at least one copyright aspect involved here is the Doctrine of First Sale (sections 14(a)(ii) and 14(c)(iii) of the Copyright Act, 1957). While it is accepted that one cannot commercialise the image of the actor (say by printing it on tee-shirts, cups, key chains, and other merch), because of his image rights being involved, it also holds true per the same doctrine, that even the owner of copyright in the postcard, once it has been sold to ‘X’, cannot control the further movement of the same. Simply put, resale of it, even if at a premium, cannot be stopped. A question arises—can the holder of image rights stop it; legally speaking?It is notable that the material part of the content in the concerned picture postcards (as revealed by links 12-19, mentioning used postcards), comprise of certain images of the concerned actor. These images are not being ‘reproduced’ by the seller—the latter is simply re-selling the product on eBay. On eBay, sellers list their items for sale or auction. The listings usually mention the item description such as ‘used’ or ‘good condition’ in this case, and also the payment and shipping options. Given this, it is a bit curious why and how the links appear under the head ‘infringing third parties’.In the bygone era before the advent of social media, picture postcards featuring beloved Indian screen actors were all the rage. Fans, starved for glimpses of their idols. They reveled in collecting and exchanging these postcards, much like stamp enthusiasts with their postage stamps. It would have been virtually impossible for anyone, including the actors themselves, to remain unaware of the widespread existence and popularity of these postcards.Assuming that the printer/publisher of the concerned postcards printed the same, long long ago, in violation of copyright. Is it just, on the principles of equity, to raise this belated issue now, particularly when there is no specific injury attached? This is a potent question that needs to be decided by the court here.It is common knowledge that equity favours the awake, not those who snooze and take a break!For the ‘flagged’ John Does, the suit appears to be barred by the Doctrine of Laches. Such postcards were expected to be routinely in possession of fans at least in bygone times, but the plaintiff, Anil Kapoor failed to take any action since.In Union of India v. Tarsem Singh (2008) 8 SCC 652para 5, the apex court, albeit in a different context, had the occasion to dwell upon the Doctrine of Laches.To reproduce [with inputs], ‘One of the exceptions to the said rule [laches]is cases relating to a continuing wrong. Where a claim is based on a continuing wrong, relief can be granted even if there is a long delay in seeking remedy, with reference to the date on which the continuing wrong commenced, if such continuing wrong creates a continuing source of injury. But there is an exception to the exception. If the grievance …affect[s] several others also, and if the reopening of the issue would affect the settled rights of third parties (like the fans who bought those postcards and are aiming to resell now), then the claim will not be entertained.’Should the above not apply to the claims made by the Plaintiff in the instant case?Further, in Cable News Network Lp, Lllp (Cnn) v. Cam News Network Limited MIPR 2008 (1) 113, 2008 (36) PTC 255 Del, para 24, the HC of Delhi states that, ‘mere passage of time cannot constitute laches, but if the passage of time can be shown to have lulled defendant into a false sense of security, and the defendant acts in reliance thereon, laches may, in the discretion of the trial court, be found.When there is a long delay in lodging a protest against an alleged infringement, like in the instant case, harm to the defendant could arise simply because the plaintiff did not act sooner. This delay could have happened because the plaintiff was aware of the infringement or did not think it to be harmful enough to his vocation. Should then the defendant be penalised for being entrapped into a deceptive sense of safety created by the plaintiff’s inaction?In my assessment, the answer should be in the negative. Links 12-17 of the alleged third-party infringers merely seem to be innocuous fans hoping to earn extra cash by selling on eBay the used postcards they once cherished. They seem to be protected by the Doctrine of First Sale or the Doctrine of Laches. (In fact, I would love to argue that these fans can even mint an NFT-Non-Fungible Token of the same. After all, it only means listing an NFT on a digital marketplace for sale! —but I would leave that for another post)Is there any image/ name tarnishment, passing off of/in respect of the actor here? Simply none.In India, the term ‘personality rights’ gained traction only in the past few years—thanks to litigation involving Gautam Gambhir, and Amitabh Bachchan. Anil Kapoor one being the latest. Celebrities of all kinds are in the business of making money through their persona. Being their bread and butter, it is understandable if aware persons of eminence get fixated to their ‘personality’ or ‘image’ rights.However, the scenario of courts getting plethoric and lavish in doling out remedies in favour of the celebrity plaintiffs is not comprehensible, for they are Courts of Law. The present interim order does not give sufficient legal reasons for its overarching contents. Something in the same vein has been maintained by the authors in a previous Spicy post in re Amitabh Bachchan HC order.As the field of law concerning the intersection of copyright and image rights is still in its early stages, with no established legal precedent, it becomes even more imperative that interim orders of this nature evolve beyond being vague and superficial.Though personality or image rights appear to be an unorthodox form of intellectual property, the answer can be in the affirmative here. One can always learn from Italy who is perhaps the only country whose law firmly assert that using someone’s images, pictures etc. for commercial purposes requires that person’s consent and this is without exception. However, it would be humane, equitable and fair to add that an applicant seeking specific damages for image rights infringement must prove resulting damage, injury, or loss from such infringement. Mentioned John Does do not seem to fit the bill."

    "data": "We are pleased to announce that registration for the free Certificate Course in Application of Intellectual Property Rights for Startups and Entrepreneurship is currently open. The course is supported by Texas A&M University School of Law and will be delivered in-person at the Centre for Technology and Law, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar on November 22 and 23. The instructors for the course are Prof. Srividhya Ragavan and Swaraj Paul Barooah. For further details please see their call for participation below. According to the Economic Survey Report 2022-23, start-ups in India, as recognised by the Department of Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT), have risen from a mere 452 in 2016 to an impressive 84,012 in 2022, a staggering 18,587% jump in a short span of 6 years! This exponential growth in entrepreneurial activities in India is being led by tech-based start-ups. As per a NASSCOM report, India added a whopping over 1,300 active tech start-ups in the year 2022, taking the total tally of such start-ups to approx. 26,000, accounting for 31% of the overall start-up ecosystem in India! This ever-rising rate of entrepreneurship in India is being fuelled by her gigantic population of 1.43 billion people, accounting for 17.76% of world’s overall human population, second to none in terms of quantum of human resources. India’s youthful population, which has a median age of 28.2 years, one of the lowest in the world, offers her a rare advantage of a demographic dividend, boosted by an unprecedented bulge in her working age population.Here lies the role and significance of start-ups in India, attested by the fact that in the year 2022 alone, the 84,012 start-ups recognised by DPIIT have created 9+ lakh jobs with an increase of 64% over last year! Entrepreneurs – technologically armed, legally aware, financially shrewd, managerially efficient, and enthused with a patriotic zeal to create dignified jobs for a rising India – can make a big impact on the Indian economy. The digital age in which we live has unleashed a new band of entrepreneurs who leverage technology and know-how of fundamental and computer sciences to generate novel and disruptive entrepreneurial ideas. These “techno-entrepreneurs” are not just building new enterprises with exponentially rising revenues but also creating employment opportunities for millions. At the core of these tech-start-ups lie entrepreneurial ideas that are deeply rooted in advancements in science and technology. Intellectual Property Rights (“IPR”) law empowers such techno-entrepreneurs to protect their ideas and inventions from misappropriation and encroachment by others, and thereby, enables them to unlock the true potential value of their intellectual property.Intellectual properties are the manifestation of digital revolution that fuels 21st century technologically-driven economies. These are intangible creations of human mind that promise a stable stream of revenue to their creators. These intellectual properties are “assets” that have a measurable economic value in terms of their intrinsic worth and are capable of commercial exploitation. As owners of their intellect, inventors of intellectual properties have a natural right to exclusively commercialise the products of their minds. This liberty to benefit from one’s intellectual creation gives rise to a bundle of rights related to intellectual property, including, Patents, Copyrights, Trademarks, Geographical Indications, among others.The 21st century India relies on inventions, innovation, creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of the human mind to create employment for her burgeoning youth population and IPR law ensures that the goal is gainfully achieved. Studying IPR law empowers Entrepreneurs to protect and promote their innovation, invention and creations. Understanding IPR law enables “legally aware entrepreneurs/techno-entrepreneurs” to navigate these complex transactions and negotiate favourably. Neglect of IPR law can lead to unintentional infringement, resulting in costly legal disputes. Nevertheless, awareness about dispute settlement strategies can minimise the economic and legal costs of ignoring IPR law.Designed primarily to cater to the entrepreneurial zeal of engineering and management students, this one and a half-day program provides an invaluable foundation in the principles, practices, and significance of IPR to entrepreneurship and start-up enthusiasts. Participants will delve into the significance of IPR for entrepreneurship, exploring the various forms of IPRs that are relevant for entrepreneurial ventures, while gaining practical insights into the strategies, processes, and legal aspects that underpin Patent, Copyright and Trademark protection and enforcement. The course is being supported by Texas A&M University School of Law.The participants of the course can expect the following learning outcomes at the conclusion of the course:The course will be delivered in-person at the Centre for Technology and Law, Dhirubhai Ambani Institute of Information and Communication Technology (DA-IICT), Gandhinagar, on November 22 and 23, 2023.

    "data": "[This post has been authored by SpicyIP intern Rohan Srivastava. Rohan is a Second Year student at National Law School Of India University and has a keen interest in IPR and Technology Law.]The recent increase in COVID-19 cases in India comes as a Deja Vu, reminiscent of the predicament India and the world were in 2 years ago. While the spike should not be a cause of concern owing to a proper vaccination run (also see here for the number of doses administered), elsewhere, experts and delegates are still engaged in negotiations over a possible extension of the TRIPS waiver to medical supplies and pharmaceuticals products. The TRIPS waiver, which became a hot topic for debates around multilateralism from October 2020, brought to the forefront the international community’s inaction and paralysis in the face of a global crisis of unprecedented scale. The fact that the negotiations recently extended the deadline for deciding on the waiver, almost a year after the medical emergency was subdued, is itself a testament to how time taking and inefficient the waiver fiasco has ended up being. This post will seek to look back at the controversy surrounding the waiver and reflect on it with the benefit of hindsight. In doing so, this post shall uncover the handicaps in seeking the TRIPS waiver, both internally in the WTO decision-making process and problems with the idea of a waiver as a way out of the crisis. This piece will then conclude with certain considerations that must be kept in mind for the future.The Pandemic was not the first time that the WTO’s inefficient decision-making process came to the forefront. (For example- Trade Law enthusiasts will recall the painstakingly long Doha Round of Negotiations, which were the 9th round of negotiations and the first since the WTO was established.) Part of the reason behind the WTO’s inefficient decision-making is its consensus-based model. Consensus, at WTO, means the lack of sustained opposition i.e. a decision is made when no member formally objects to it. (In the context of the TRIPS waiver, the consensus-based decision-making model can be seen in Article IX: 3 (1) of the Marrakesh agreement r/w Footnote 1.)Thus, decision-making at the WTO requires lobbying each and every member of the Organization in support, which often ends up being a zero-sum game for the members. While there is certainly merit in having this consensus-based approach, insofar as it is more democratic and allows due consideration to be given to all viewpoints, the pandemic has clearly exposed that the same rationale may be turned on its head during a medical health emergency. Already, there has been a lot of global north and global south contention over the availability of essential medicines at the time of crisis. For instance, the HIV/AIDS crisis and the surrounding access to medicines issue that started off in 2001 and fructified into an amendment only in 2017 (see here). The same was reflected in the context of TRIPS COVID-19 Vaccine waiver as well, where first a broad waiver was proposed by the member countries (see here and here) and after the subsequently revised proposals (see here), the existing waiver, which applies only on vaccines, was accepted. These instances show how the consensus-based approach at the WTO, which can be argued to protect the interests of the less influential countries, can also work against them when decision-making is required to be made in emergencies where time is of the essence. This is especially significant since the developing countries have for long been in majority in the WTO but still have not had their say, for the self-interests of a handful of developed nations (read here and here). What is even more ironic is that despite the strong resistance by the developed nations in the negotiation process which led to further delays in reaching a conclusive and timely waiver, the ministerial council’s final decision did not even concern the developed nations as they were not eligible members as per the document. What is to be kept in mind is that it was ultimately the developing countries that had to face the brunt of being deprived of their IP Protection. (Find more on this here.) Looking at the October 2020 draft, proponents claimed that a waiver is necessary to ensure proper access because the existing flexibilities in the TRIPS such as compulsory licensing etc. are not feasible in an emergency such as the pandemic. However, proponent countries themselves actively refused from utilising already existing flexibilities first to reach the above assertion. For instance, the Indian Supreme Court even questioned the Indian government’s reluctance to utilise compulsory licensing provisions in domestic law on precisely this point, and yet there was no action on this front. (Read more on this here) The lack of an efficient internal decision-making process at the WTO and wide disagreements over the desirability of a waiver raises the question of whether it is the appropriate recourse at times of crisis or if the global community would do better to envisage alternative mechanisms in the future. The opponents of the waiver, who were mostly the developed nations housing the major pharmaceutical manufacturers, argued that the October 2020 waiver will take away the incentive to innovate the cure for the pandemic. They instead argued that the members should utilize the flexibilities incorporated within the TRIPS in order to cater to the rising need for essential commodities. Even the final ministerial decision was an iteration of the opponent’s sentiment only, in so far as it did not technically waive off any IPR protections under the TRIPS but instead clarified the existing flexibilities. Looking at the TRIPS agreement, one can see that it is cognizant of the need to balance such social imperatives with the protection of IPR, and has incorporated relevant structural features. For instance, Article 7 provides that the ‘protection and enforcement of intellectual property rights shall be in a manner conducive to social and economic welfare’ while Article 8 states that Members ‘may, in formulating or amending their laws and regulations, adopt measures necessary to protect public health … provided that such measures are consistent with the provisions of the Agreement’. The TRIPS agreement makes it clear that Members are free to pursue legitimate public policy objectives. Furthermore, despite claims to the contrary, TRIPS flexibilities, including mandatory licensure, pharmaceutical transition measures, parallel importation, and research exceptions, have all been used and successfully demonstrated. For instance, a study by Ellen t’Hoen et al on the use of TRIPS flexibilities found that 89 countries used TRIPS flexibilities 176 times between 2001 and 2016, with over half of those uses (79.5%) involving Compulsory license, public noncommercial use, and LDC pharmaceutical transition measure. Thus, one would not be wrong to think that a lot of crucial time wasted in the negotiations at the time of the crisis could have been saved, had the proponents focussed more on aggressively pursuing the existing options or seeking clarification regarding the same for greater certainty, especially given that this was what was eventually agreed to instead of having a blanket waiver. It is undoubtedly true that a global crisis of such a magnitude would require multilateral cooperation and collective initiatives, the question however is what could be achieved by a patent waiver when most LDC countries lack the required infrastructure capabilities to actually engage in vaccine manufacture. Looking at a chart of key vaccine developing countries (here) one can see that there are only a handful of developing countries with vaccine manufacturing prowess. Assuming the broader waiver proposal was accepted, the opponents (housing the majority of vaccine developers) could still have refused to apply the same in their countries, (this intent is evident from the outcome waiver document that expressly exempts the developed countries from the ambit of its application). And thus, the only benefit that would have occurred out of the broad waiver would have been the flexibility to not be sued for non-consensual use of the IP involved in the production of the vaccines, by the manufacturers located in these developing- broad waiver proponent countries. However, it is pertinent to note, that if the ultimate benefit of the waiver would have been the freedom from being sued for non-consensual use of the underlying IP, then as argued above, TRIPS already caters to it under Article 73 (b)(iii), and thus making the whole exercise largely a rut. It is also interesting to note that the developed countries which came to the table in favour of the TRIPS waiver in the name of multilateral cooperation for assuring equitable access to vaccines, were at the same time also doing lip service to their commitments by signing bulky procurement orders with multiple vaccine manufacturers to keep their eggs in several baskets. These orders were also often in excess of the vaccine requirement of the particular country, at a time when vaccine availability across the world was uncertain. The TRIPS negotiation allowed vaccine nationalism to maintain face at the international fora as is also evident from the final ministerial decision which limited the applicability to the developing countries and LDCs. (Refer here) It thus becomes evident that a TRIPS waiver cannot be seen as a ready response that will act as a panacea to the woes of vaccine availability during times of crisis. With regards to the internal process in the WTO, the pandemic has made it clear that WTO cannot be expected to make ad-hoc decisions due to the consensus requirements given that differing considerations, such as the impact on innovation etc. are involved in such a decision. The only hope on the IPR front would be for the WTO to create structural safeguards that can aid in times of such crisis and clarify such flexibilities. Given that the utility of a waiver itself is also under question, the WTO also needs to focus more on ensuring the availability of vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and treatment options by continuing its efforts to identify and reduce barriers to trade, to ensure that states which do not have the institutional capacity to make use of the waiver are not left out. One instance of such a barrier is regulatory bottlenecks which impeded the speedy dispersal of vaccines globally. (Read more on this here and here) In addition to this, there have also been criticisms against the TRIPS framework for being unable to protect the interest of developing nations and encouraging the growth of technology in the LDCs. So far, TRIPS has only ensured greater IP protection to technology-generating countries and there has been no trickle-down or transfer of technology from the higher-income countries to the LDCs, despite having provisions urging the same. It is imperative that WHO, which is better suited for responding to a global health crisis, steps up to the game for ensuring equitable access to vaccines, pharmaceuticals, and other medical aid through multilateral cooperation. Much of the international cooperation in such efforts will also depend upon the fate of the global treaty for future pandemic emergencies under the WHO which is currently under negotiations. The main purpose of the initiative is to ensure early detection and prevention of future pandemics, including a stronger international health framework within the WHO that would attempt to ensure universal and equitable access to medical solutions. It is also pertinent to note that the treaty includes provisions for timely waiver of IP protection so that there is no tussle at the time of crisis and valuable time and lives are not wasted (Article 7.4). However, as if the international community refuses to learn, the negotiations are again facing institutional concerns and are being done in a non-transparent manner (See Talha Burki’s statement on this media coverage here). This can potentially undermine trust in the process and history might again repeat itself with another deadlock over the differences between the developed and developing nations and over the fate of countless lives.Multilateral cooperation at times of global emergencies like the pandemic is understandably hard to come by given the pressing needs each member state has internally. The COVID-19 pandemic cannot be seen as a one-off event and it is widely predicted that as man taps more with nature it is likely that there may be a rise in the frequency of pandemics. Thus, it would do well if the international community sees the entire TRIPS waiver fiasco as a lesson on how things pan out practically in times of crisis and is able to come up with more practical and efficient mechanisms which would allow all states to acquire an equitable supply of vaccines despite the socio-economic inequalities across the borders.

    "data": "It is critical for the government to be forward-thinking. The Biotechnology Industry Research Assistance Council, a government department, is reported to have provided INR 70 to 100 crores to Gennova Pharmaceuticals for its development of an mRNA vaccine for Covid. The mRNA technology is a versatile platform technology that has been heralded as a new era in vaccines. The platform used by Gennova (saRNA – self-amplifying RNA) overcomes storage / temperature issues that affected previous versions of mRNA vaccines. Unlike existing mRNA vaccines that need to be stored at very low temperatures, saRNA vaccines can be freeze-dried and stored at higher temperatures. Lower cost and freeze-drying would solve some major distribution problems.Significant public health benefits lie in the versatility of this platform. While currently used for Covid, trials are underway for its use to treat other diseases such as Zika, Zoster and Rabies. This platform technology has potential for use for several other infectious as well as non-infectious diseases including TB, malaria, dengue and possibly even cancer, auto-immune diseases, and diabetes. Given its versatility, it is not possible for one pharmaceutical company to explore the technology’s wide-ranging applications. True value can be unlocked only through widespread research, proper regulation and use. There is therefore a need to make the technology more accessible.Access to this technology is, however, at risk. The government has blanketly refused to disclose its collaboration agreement with Gennova. Prashant has challenged this refusal before the Delhi High Court. As per precedent decided in Navroz Mody v. Mumbai Port Trust, the government is obligated to disclose public-private partnership agreements.Locking up the collaboration agreement bodes badly for public health efforts. The public, scientists, researchers and other industry players, all of whom can contribute to effective use of this technology, are in the dark about intellectual property rights that surround it. Typically, collaboration agreements contain key details about the invention, scientific and manufacturing processes, intellectual property right ownership, research plans, collaborator rights, resource allocation etc. Therefore, the collaboration agreement may contain material information as to ownership of patents, trade secrets and other technology. And knowledge regarding ownership of intellectual property is the first step towards increasing its access.The government, through this collaboration agreement, may have in its hands very lucrative technological secrets. mRNA vaccines contain three main ingredients – mRNA, the lipids (that encase the mRNA) and sugars / stabilisers. The process of sequencing, making, mixing, purifying and combining each of these ingredients requires expert knowledge. Gennova that developed these mRNA-based vaccines, in collaboration with a US bio-tech company HDT, surely has the required expertise. Many of these processes can also be documented and drug regulatory approvals require their documentation. Through the collaboration agreement the government may also have access to these documents and consequently to the process of making mRNA vaccines. This is no small issue given the vast potential of this technology.While the collaboration agreement should definitely be disclosed, the government may have reason not to disclose trade secrets such as manufacturing processes to make and use the mRNA platform. ‘Trade secrets’ have a specific meaning under law. However, at this point it is unclear whether this information will qualify as trade secrets given the USD 950 million lawsuit against Gennova for trade secrecy theft pending in the US. To defend itself, it is possible that Gennova may argue that these processes do not qualify as ‘trade secrets’. In which case there will be no reason for the government to withhold this information from the public. Further, since the government funded Gennova’s efforts, it is significant for the public to understand the impact of this lawsuit on the government and government funds. All this will be known only if the collaboration agreement is disclosed. Separately, assuming that these are indeed trade secrets, instead of locking them up, the government should establish transparent processes to increase technology transfer. The government can do this by disseminating information to universities or private industries by facilitating technical cooperation. Given that the world at large is interested in the mRNA platform, these efforts will attract investments into India, increase industry uptake and increase innovation around this new technology. Mutually beneficial relationships with industry and researchers can be established through transparent and reasonable licensing agreements that can increase access to this technology. Instead of digging in its heels, the government should disclose the collaboration agreement and should pursue ways to increase access to technologies that can have significant public health benefits."
