    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Bhima Koregaon violence case: Supreme Court adjourns interim medical bail plea of Prof Shoma Sen to December 6",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state. The Commission had recently organised meetings in Guwahati, where they heard people’s grievances, he said, adding that they have asked the state government to remove road blockades, which were still there. He said 180 people have recently died, out of which, compensation was provided to 93 persons. The Commission had recommended to the Manipur government to allot funds for them to rebuild their houses. NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra. Calling child pornography a heinous crime against children, the NHRC Chairperson stressed on bringing a strict law against it. Talking about internet bullying and the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet, he said the Commission has issued an advisory in this regard.Justice Mishra said cells should be made in all states, adding that Internet mediators should regulate content available on websites. He said it was important to train people, including children, to tackle such crimes, adding that awareness should be raised through various mediums for prevention of such crimes.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "headline": "Bhima Koregaon violence case: Supreme Court adjourns interim medical bail plea of Prof Shoma Sen to December 6",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "data": "National Human Rights Commission Chairperson Justice Arun Mishra on Wednesday said the Commission had sufficient powers, which were being put to good use, in response to a question whether NHRC was a toothless tiger.Speaking at a symposium on ‘Challenges Before NHRC’ organised by the India Legal Research Foundation (ILRF) in conversation with APN News Editor-in-Chief Rajshri Rai, the NHRC Chairperson said various authorities across the country followed and implemented 90 per cent of directives issued by the Commission. He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds.

The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "data": "National Human Rights Commission Chairperson Justice Arun Mishra on Wednesday said the Commission had sufficient powers, which were being put to good use, in response to a question whether NHRC was a toothless tiger.Speaking at a symposium on ‘Challenges Before NHRC’ organised by the India Legal Research Foundation (ILRF) in conversation with APN News Editor-in-Chief Rajshri Rai, the NHRC Chairperson said various authorities across the country followed and implemented 90 per cent of directives issued by the Commission. He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state. The Commission had recently organised meetings in Guwahati, where they heard people’s grievances, he said, adding that they have asked the state government to remove road blockades, which were still there. He said 180 people have recently died, out of which, compensation was provided to 93 persons. The Commission had recommended to the Manipur government to allot funds for them to rebuild their houses. NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra. Calling child pornography a heinous crime against children, the NHRC Chairperson stressed on bringing a strict law against it. Talking about internet bullying and the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet, he said the Commission has issued an advisory in this regard.Justice Mishra said cells should be made in all states, adding that Internet mediators should regulate content available on websites. He said it was important to train people, including children, to tackle such crimes, adding that awareness should be raised through various mediums for prevention of such crimes.

A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra. Calling child pornography a heinous crime against children, the NHRC Chairperson stressed on bringing a strict law against it. Talking about internet bullying and the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet, he said the Commission has issued an advisory in this regard.Justice Mishra said cells should be made in all states, adding that Internet mediators should regulate content available on websites. He said it was important to train people, including children, to tackle such crimes, adding that awareness should be raised through various mediums for prevention of such crimes.

In the said affidavit-inopposition, it was mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 on the basis of a report dated 25.11.2016 received from the Respondent No. 2 (Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon) . It was further mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 through the RTGS but later on 27.12.2016, a Communication was received from the Respondent No. 2 stating the name of the Petitioner as the next of the kin of Late Loknath Saikia. It was further stated that since the amount of exgratia was already paid to the Respondent No. 4, the question of payment to another beneficiary did not arise.The Court also finds in a Communication dated 25.11.2016 issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon whereby the list of NOKs of the martyrs of Assam falling under Nagaon District was enclosed. The list upon being perused reveals that against the martyr , the name of the Respondent No. 4 was shown alongwith his address, mobile number and bank account details.In a Communication dated 27.12.2016 a month’s later issued by the same Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon to the Joint Secretary to the Govt.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra. Calling child pornography a heinous crime against children, the NHRC Chairperson stressed on bringing a strict law against it. Talking about internet bullying and the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet, he said the Commission has issued an advisory in this regard.Justice Mishra said cells should be made in all states, adding that Internet mediators should regulate content available on websites.

The Court also sought for the instructions as to whether the payment was made on the basis of the next of kin certificate produced by the Respondent No. 4 and if so, the said details may be mentioned in the affidavit to be filed by the District Commissioner, Nagaon.

    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur University",
    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "headline": "Bhima Koregaon violence case: Supreme Court adjourns interim medical bail plea of Prof Shoma Sen to December 6",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "headline": "NHRC Chairperson Justice Arun Mishra says Commission has sufficient powers, not a toothless tiger",
    "data": "National Human Rights Commission Chairperson Justice Arun Mishra on Wednesday said the Commission had sufficient powers, which were being put to good use, in response to a question whether NHRC was a toothless tiger.Speaking at a symposium on ‘Challenges Before NHRC’ organised by the India Legal Research Foundation (ILRF) in conversation with APN News Editor-in-Chief Rajshri Rai, the NHRC Chairperson said various authorities across the country followed and implemented 90 per cent of directives issued by the Commission. He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network.

    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state. The Commission had recently organised meetings in Guwahati, where they heard people’s grievances, he said, adding that they have asked the state government to remove road blockades, which were still there. He said 180 people have recently died, out of which, compensation was provided to 93 persons. The Commission had recommended to the Manipur government to allot funds for them to rebuild their houses.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership.

Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property.

    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds.

    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra. Calling child pornography a heinous crime against children, the NHRC Chairperson stressed on bringing a strict law against it. Talking about internet bullying and the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet, he said the Commission has issued an advisory in this regard.Justice Mishra said cells should be made in all states, adding that Internet mediators should regulate content available on websites. He said it was important to train people, including children, to tackle such crimes, adding that awareness should be raised through various mediums for prevention of such crimes.

    "data": "The state government of Gauhati has been directed by the Gauhati High Court to pay a compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs to the daughter of a man who was killed by the police when he was participating in the Assam movement on 30.11.1981.A single judge bench of Justice Devashis Baruah disposed of a Petition seeking a direction upon the concerned Respondent Authorities for payment of the ex-gratia compensation of Rs.5 lakhs under the Government of Assam to the martyrs family.The Petitioner is the daughter of Late Loknath Saikia who was killed by the police when he was participating in the Assam movement on 30.11.1981. The Petitioner on coming to learn about the said ex-gratia compensation scheme of the Government of Assam applied for the said grant of Rs. 5 lakhs but the same was refused on the ground that the said amount have been already disbursed to the Respondent No. 4 (brother of Petitioner’s father) . It is under such circumstances that the instant petition has been filed. The Petitioner in the said petition have enclosed the certificate issued by Additional Deputy Magistrate, Nagaon dated 13.08.2017 issued in pursuance to Rule 2(a) of the Assam Public Service (Preferential Appointment) Rules, 1999 certifying that her father was killed in connection with the participation in the Assam movement on the problems of foreigners .Pursuant to the filing of the petition, the Respondent No. 4 had filed an affidavit-in-opposition, wherein 6 he had duly admitted that he had received the said amount of Rs. 5 lakhs and further that he never made any claim for the said amount.

It was also mentioned in the said affidavit that out of the amount of Rs. 5 lakhs so received in the month of December, 2016, the Respondent No. 4 constructed a monument in memory of his brother in the courtyard of the Respondent’s house by spending an amount of Rs. 2 lakhs and further donated an amount of Rs. 1,50,000/- for the development of Temple on 01.02.2017. Further to that, an amount of Rs.10,000/- was donated for development of a temple in the month of February, 2017.The Petitioner filed an affidavit-in-reply to the affidavit-n-opposition denying the contents of the said affidavit-in-opposition and stating inter alia that the amount so paid and/or donated is nothing but absurd and without the knowledge of the Petitioner.The Bench noted that the affidavit-in-opposition was filed by the Respondent No. 1 (State Government) through the Deputy Secretary to the Government of Assam, Implementation of Assam Accord Department. In the said affidavit-inopposition, it was mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 on the basis of a report dated 25.11.2016 received from the Respondent No. 2 (Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon) . It was further mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 through the RTGS but later on 27.12.2016, a Communication was received from the Respondent No. 2 stating the name of the Petitioner as the next of the kin of Late Loknath Saikia. It was further stated that since the amount of exgratia was already paid to the Respondent No. 4, the question of payment to another beneficiary did not arise.The Court also finds in a Communication dated 25.11.2016 issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon whereby the list of NOKs of the martyrs of Assam falling under Nagaon District was enclosed. The list upon being perused reveals that against the martyr , the name of the Respondent No. 4 was shown alongwith his address, mobile number and bank account details.In a Communication dated 27.12.2016 a month’s later issued by the same Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon to the Joint Secretary to the Govt. Assam intimating the names of various next of kins of the martyrs of Assam agitation falling under Nagaon District whose ex-gratia sanction amount sanctioned/Momento have not been received by the next of kin concerned for the reasons shown against their names. The list enclosed upon being perused reveals that as regards the martyr , the name of the Petitioner was shown as a daughter along with his bank details and in the remarks column, it was mentioned as “NOK changed”.The Court had taken up the matter on 12.10.2023 and on that day the Court sought for certain instructions from the District Commissioner, Nagaon as to under what basis the Respondent No. 4 was paid the ex-gratia amount. The Court also sought for the instructions as to whether the payment was made on the basis of the next of kin certificate produced by the Respondent No. 4 and if so, the said details may be mentioned in the affidavit to be filed by the District Commissioner, Nagaon. This Court further enquired with the District Commissioner, Nagaon as to what steps the said authority would take if the amount of ex-gratia is paid to the wrong beneficiary.\\On 16.11.2023 , Government Advocate has placed before the Court the instructions as sought for vide the order dated 12.10.2023. From the said instructions, it reveals that the martyr was killed in the Assam Agitation 83 on 30.11.1981. It was further mentioned that the Circle Officer, Samaguri Revenue Circle has reported that the wife of the martyr was appointed in a Government job and she got married and used to reside at her second matrimonial home. It was further mentioned that there was no Communication between the wife of the Martyr and other family members of the Martyr. Further to that, it was also mentioned that in order to pay tribute to the martyrs who sacrificed their life during the Assam movement “Shraddhanjali Programme” was organized centrally by the Implementation of the Assam Accord Department, Government of Assam on 10.12.2016 at to honour the families of the martyrs and extend financial assistance to them.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters.

The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Delhi court grants interim relief to man in property dispute case, says possession considered ninth point of ownership",
    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.The court noted that the matter was received back as ‘non-starter’ from the Mediation Centre. It further noted that the cost imposed vide order dated September 18, 2023 was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff side. Regarding another application filed by the defendants under Order 8 Rule 1 A seeking to place additional documents on record, the Civil Judge allowed it on the grounds that issues have not been framed yet and the present matter was at the preliminary stage only. Advocate Gagan Gandhi, appearing for the plaintiff, submitted that they have no objection if the same was allowed since the additional document was an FIR against the plaintiff and in any way it would be a matter of record.The Tis Hazari Court noted that an affidavit of admission/denial has been filed on behalf of both the sides. Perusal of the said admission/denial transpired that no reasons have been assigned by either of the parties while denying the documents. The Civil Judge granted liberty to both the parties to file additional affidavits of admission/denials assigning the due cause while denying the concerned documents.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

The list upon being perused reveals that against the martyr , the name of the Respondent No. 4 was shown alongwith his address, mobile number and bank account details.In a Communication dated 27.12.2016 a month’s later issued by the same Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon to the Joint Secretary to the Govt. Assam intimating the names of various next of kins of the martyrs of Assam agitation falling under Nagaon District whose ex-gratia sanction amount sanctioned/Momento have not been received by the next of kin concerned for the reasons shown against their names. The list enclosed upon being perused reveals that as regards the martyr , the name of the Petitioner was shown as a daughter along with his bank details and in the remarks column, it was mentioned as “NOK changed”.The Court had taken up the matter on 12.10.2023 and on that day the Court sought for certain instructions from the District Commissioner, Nagaon as to under what basis the Respondent No. 4 was paid the ex-gratia amount. The Court also sought for the instructions as to whether the payment was made on the basis of the next of kin certificate produced by the Respondent No. 4 and if so, the said details may be mentioned in the affidavit to be filed by the District Commissioner, Nagaon. This Court further enquired with the District Commissioner, Nagaon as to what steps the said authority would take if the amount of ex-gratia is paid to the wrong beneficiary.\\On 16.11.2023 , Government Advocate has placed before the Court the instructions as sought for vide the order dated 12.10.2023. From the said instructions, it reveals that the martyr was killed in the Assam Agitation 83 on 30.11.1981. It was further mentioned that the Circle Officer, Samaguri Revenue Circle has reported that the wife of the martyr was appointed in a Government job and she got married and used to reside at her second matrimonial home. It was further mentioned that there was no Communication between the wife of the Martyr and other family members of the Martyr.

    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state. The Commission had recently organised meetings in Guwahati, where they heard people’s grievances, he said, adding that they have asked the state government to remove road blockades, which were still there. He said 180 people have recently died, out of which, compensation was provided to 93 persons. The Commission had recommended to the Manipur government to allot funds for them to rebuild their houses. NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Delhi court grants interim relief to man in property dispute case, says possession considered ninth point of ownership",
    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.The court noted that the matter was received back as ‘non-starter’ from the Mediation Centre. It further noted that the cost imposed vide order dated September 18, 2023 was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff side. Regarding another application filed by the defendants under Order 8 Rule 1 A seeking to place additional documents on record, the Civil Judge allowed it on the grounds that issues have not been framed yet and the present matter was at the preliminary stage only. Advocate Gagan Gandhi, appearing for the plaintiff, submitted that they have no objection if the same was allowed since the additional document was an FIR against the plaintiff and in any way it would be a matter of record.The Tis Hazari Court noted that an affidavit of admission/denial has been filed on behalf of both the sides. Perusal of the said admission/denial transpired that no reasons have been assigned by either of the parties while denying the documents. The Civil Judge granted liberty to both the parties to file additional affidavits of admission/denials assigning the due cause while denying the concerned documents.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

Further to that, an amount of Rs.10,000/- was donated for development of a temple in the month of February, 2017.The Petitioner filed an affidavit-in-reply to the affidavit-n-opposition denying the contents of the said affidavit-in-opposition and stating inter alia that the amount so paid and/or donated is nothing but absurd and without the knowledge of the Petitioner.The Bench noted that the affidavit-in-opposition was filed by the Respondent No. 1 (State Government) through the Deputy Secretary to the Government of Assam, Implementation of Assam Accord Department. In the said affidavit-inopposition, it was mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 on the basis of a report dated 25.11.2016 received from the Respondent No. 2 (Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon) . It was further mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 through the RTGS but later on 27.12.2016, a Communication was received from the Respondent No. 2 stating the name of the Petitioner as the next of the kin of Late Loknath Saikia. It was further stated that since the amount of exgratia was already paid to the Respondent No. 4, the question of payment to another beneficiary did not arise.The Court also finds in a Communication dated 25.11.2016 issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon whereby the list of NOKs of the martyrs of Assam falling under Nagaon District was enclosed. The list upon being perused reveals that against the martyr , the name of the Respondent No. 4 was shown alongwith his address, mobile number and bank account details.In a Communication dated 27.12.2016 a month’s later issued by the same Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon to the Joint Secretary to the Govt. Assam intimating the names of various next of kins of the martyrs of Assam agitation falling under Nagaon District whose ex-gratia sanction amount sanctioned/Momento have not been received by the next of kin concerned for the reasons shown against their names. The list enclosed upon being perused reveals that as regards the martyr , the name of the Petitioner was shown as a daughter along with his bank details and in the remarks column, it was mentioned as “NOK changed”.The Court had taken up the matter on 12.10.2023 and on that day the Court sought for certain instructions from the District Commissioner, Nagaon as to under what basis the Respondent No. 4 was paid the ex-gratia amount. The Court also sought for the instructions as to whether the payment was made on the basis of the next of kin certificate produced by the Respondent No. 4 and if so, the said details may be mentioned in the affidavit to be filed by the District Commissioner, Nagaon. This Court further enquired with the District Commissioner, Nagaon as to what steps the said authority would take if the amount of ex-gratia is paid to the wrong beneficiary.\\On 16.11.2023 , Government Advocate has placed before the Court the instructions as sought for vide the order dated 12.10.2023. From the said instructions, it reveals that the martyr was killed in the Assam Agitation 83 on 30.11.1981.

However, the entitlement in respect to the said amount was of the Petitioner who admittedly is the daughter of the Martyr.Under such circumstances, the Court opined that the Respondent Authorities cannot deprive the Petitioner of the grant of ex-gratia amount of Rs.5 lakhs on account of their fault of disbursing the said amount wrongfully to the Respondent No. 4.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.The court noted that the matter was received back as ‘non-starter’ from the Mediation Centre. It further noted that the cost imposed vide order dated September 18, 2023 was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff side. Regarding another application filed by the defendants under Order 8 Rule 1 A seeking to place additional documents on record, the Civil Judge allowed it on the grounds that issues have not been framed yet and the present matter was at the preliminary stage only. Advocate Gagan Gandhi, appearing for the plaintiff, submitted that they have no objection if the same was allowed since the additional document was an FIR against the plaintiff and in any way it would be a matter of record.The Tis Hazari Court noted that an affidavit of admission/denial has been filed on behalf of both the sides. Perusal of the said admission/denial transpired that no reasons have been assigned by either of the parties while denying the documents. The Civil Judge granted liberty to both the parties to file additional affidavits of admission/denials assigning the due cause while denying the concerned documents.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "headline": "Bhima Koregaon violence case: Supreme Court adjourns interim medical bail plea of Prof Shoma Sen to December 6",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "data": "National Human Rights Commission Chairperson Justice Arun Mishra on Wednesday said the Commission had sufficient powers, which were being put to good use, in response to a question whether NHRC was a toothless tiger.Speaking at a symposium on ‘Challenges Before NHRC’ organised by the India Legal Research Foundation (ILRF) in conversation with APN News Editor-in-Chief Rajshri Rai, the NHRC Chairperson said various authorities across the country followed and implemented 90 per cent of directives issued by the Commission. He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state. The Commission had recently organised meetings in Guwahati, where they heard people’s grievances, he said, adding that they have asked the state government to remove road blockades, which were still there. He said 180 people have recently died, out of which, compensation was provided to 93 persons. The Commission had recommended to the Manipur government to allot funds for them to rebuild their houses. NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra. Calling child pornography a heinous crime against children, the NHRC Chairperson stressed on bringing a strict law against it. Talking about internet bullying and the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet, he said the Commission has issued an advisory in this regard.Justice Mishra said cells should be made in all states, adding that Internet mediators should regulate content available on websites. He said it was important to train people, including children, to tackle such crimes, adding that awareness should be raised through various mediums for prevention of such crimes.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property.

It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network.

    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

In the said affidavit-inopposition, it was mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 on the basis of a report dated 25.11.2016 received from the Respondent No. 2 (Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon) . It was further mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 through the RTGS but later on 27.12.2016, a Communication was received from the Respondent No. 2 stating the name of the Petitioner as the next of the kin of Late Loknath Saikia.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "headline": "Bhima Koregaon violence case: Supreme Court adjourns interim medical bail plea of Prof Shoma Sen to December 6",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "data": "National Human Rights Commission Chairperson Justice Arun Mishra on Wednesday said the Commission had sufficient powers, which were being put to good use, in response to a question whether NHRC was a toothless tiger.Speaking at a symposium on ‘Challenges Before NHRC’ organised by the India Legal Research Foundation (ILRF) in conversation with APN News Editor-in-Chief Rajshri Rai, the NHRC Chairperson said various authorities across the country followed and implemented 90 per cent of directives issued by the Commission. He said there may be staff shortage at the state commissions but expressed hope they will be filled soon by the state governments concerned, he assured, adding India topped in implementing mechanisms to protect human rights.To a question related to the global alliance of human rights organisations deferring the accreditation of NHRC India in May 2023 due to lack of diversity in staff and political interference in appointments, the NHRC Chairperson said till 20 years, they had no problems. Justice Mishra pointed out that NHRC was one of the most powerful commissions in the world, which was getting its due recognition across the world. NHRC India was invited as an expert to speak in two programmes in Denmark and in Dubai, he noted.He said many countries did not have such commissions, adding that their officials were coming to India to learn complaint management.Regarding the rights of women in Manipur, Justice Mishra said the situation had still not normalised in the hill state. The Commission had recently organised meetings in Guwahati, where they heard people’s grievances, he said, adding that they have asked the state government to remove road blockades, which were still there. He said 180 people have recently died, out of which, compensation was provided to 93 persons. The Commission had recommended to the Manipur government to allot funds for them to rebuild their houses. NHRC had also recommended to the state government to provide employment, education and nutritious food to people living in relief camps, added Justice Mishra.

Talking about internet bullying and the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the Internet, he said the Commission has issued an advisory in this regard.Justice Mishra said cells should be made in all states, adding that Internet mediators should regulate content available on websites. He said it was important to train people, including children, to tackle such crimes, adding that awareness should be raised through various mediums for prevention of such crimes.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property.

It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network.

    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

In the said affidavit-inopposition, it was mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 on the basis of a report dated 25.11.2016 received from the Respondent No. 2 (Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon) . It was further mentioned that the payment was made to the Respondent No. 4 through the RTGS but later on 27.12.2016, a Communication was received from the Respondent No. 2 stating the name of the Petitioner as the next of the kin of Late Loknath Saikia. It was further stated that since the amount of exgratia was already paid to the Respondent No. 4, the question of payment to another beneficiary did not arise.The Court also finds in a Communication dated 25.11.2016 issued by the Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon whereby the list of NOKs of the martyrs of Assam falling under Nagaon District was enclosed. The list upon being perused reveals that against the martyr , the name of the Respondent No. 4 was shown alongwith his address, mobile number and bank account details.In a Communication dated 27.12.2016 a month’s later issued by the same Deputy Commissioner, Nagaon to the Joint Secretary to the Govt.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon.

Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child.

The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property.

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "headline": "Delhi court grants interim relief to man in property dispute case, says possession considered ninth point of ownership",
    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.The court noted that the matter was received back as ‘non-starter’ from the Mediation Centre. It further noted that the cost imposed vide order dated September 18, 2023 was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff side. Regarding another application filed by the defendants under Order 8 Rule 1 A seeking to place additional documents on record, the Civil Judge allowed it on the grounds that issues have not been framed yet and the present matter was at the preliminary stage only. Advocate Gagan Gandhi, appearing for the plaintiff, submitted that they have no objection if the same was allowed since the additional document was an FIR against the plaintiff and in any way it would be a matter of record.The Tis Hazari Court noted that an affidavit of admission/denial has been filed on behalf of both the sides. Perusal of the said admission/denial transpired that no reasons have been assigned by either of the parties while denying the documents. The Civil Judge granted liberty to both the parties to file additional affidavits of admission/denials assigning the due cause while denying the concerned documents.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "headline": "Delhi court grants interim relief to man in property dispute case, says possession considered ninth point of ownership",
    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.The court noted that the matter was received back as ‘non-starter’ from the Mediation Centre. It further noted that the cost imposed vide order dated September 18, 2023 was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff side. Regarding another application filed by the defendants under Order 8 Rule 1 A seeking to place additional documents on record, the Civil Judge allowed it on the grounds that issues have not been framed yet and the present matter was at the preliminary stage only. Advocate Gagan Gandhi, appearing for the plaintiff, submitted that they have no objection if the same was allowed since the additional document was an FIR against the plaintiff and in any way it would be a matter of record.The Tis Hazari Court noted that an affidavit of admission/denial has been filed on behalf of both the sides. Perusal of the said admission/denial transpired that no reasons have been assigned by either of the parties while denying the documents. The Civil Judge granted liberty to both the parties to file additional affidavits of admission/denials assigning the due cause while denying the concerned documents.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."

    "data": "Supreme Court quashes re-appointment of Gopinath Raveendran as Vice Chancellor of Kannur UniversityThe Supreme Court on Thursday quashed the re-appointment of Dr. Gopinath Raveendran as the Vice Chancellor of Kannur University on the grounds that the appointment was vitiated by undue interference from the Government of Kerala.The Bench of Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, Justice J.B. Pardiwala and Justice Manoj Misra observed that though the notification of appointment was issued by the Chancellor in November 2021, the same was vitiated by ‘unwarranted interference’ by the state government.Setting aside the February 2022 verdict of the Kerala High Court, the Apex Court observed that the Chancellor (Kerala Governor) ‘abdicated or surrendered’ the statutory powers for re-appointing the Vice Chancellor, rendering the entire decision making process ‘invalid’.Taking cognisance of a press release issued by the Kerala Raj Bhavan, which stated that the process of re-appointment was initiated by the Chief Minister and the Higher Education Minister of Kerala, the Bench noted that the process of re-appointment need not be similar to the fresh appointment of a Vice Chancellor. It added that re-appointment was permissible in a tenure post.Pronouncing the verdict on behalf of the Bench, Justice Pardiwala said that only the Chancellor could appoint the Vice Chancellor and not even the Pro Chancellor could intervene in the process. He said the upper age limit of 60 years as stipulated in Section 10(9) of the Kannur University Act was not applicable even in the case of reappointment for four years.Setting aside the Kerala High Court order, the Apex Court said it was not concerned with the suitability of the candidate as suitability was up to the appointment authority. The decision-making process vitiated the re-appointment of Vice Chancellor. Such a power of decision was amenable to judicial review, added the top court of the country. In February 2022, a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court had approved the re-appointment of the Vice Chancellor, upholding the December 2021 judgement of the single-judge Bench.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Thursday adjourned to December 6, the interim medical bail petition of women rights activist and academic Prof Shoma Sen, who was arrested for her alleged involvement in the Bhima Koregaon violence case.Earlier on July 17, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bode and Justice Sanjay Kumar directed Sen to file an additional affidavit on her deteriorating health within two weeks.Sen was charged under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, along with 14 other activists and academics. She has remained behind bars since June 6, 2018, lodged at the Byculla jail in Mumbai.Earlier in January this year, the Bombay High Court refused to entertain the plea challenging the order passed by the Additional Sessions Judge of Pune rejecting her bail application and asked her to approach a special court under the National Investigation Agency (NIA) Act, 2008 for bail.This was done by the court keeping in mind that the investigation was transferred to the NIA in the case.The petition by Sen before the Supreme Court highlighted a substantial question of law for determination whether the High Court was correct in its refusal to examine the trial court’s order on the ground that during the pendency of Sen’s application before the High Court, the investigation was transferred to the NIA.On May 4, the Bench of Justice Aniruddha Bose and Justice Sudhanshu Dhulia had issued notices to the NIA and the Maharashtra government in the bail plea of Shoma Sen.The NIA was represented by Additional Solicitor General (ASG) S.V. Raju, who submitted that the High Court has directed the matter to be heard again by the trial court and contended that the trial court will finish hearing the matter soon.Appearing for Sen, Senior Advocate Anand Grover argued that the bail plea seeks to challenge the High Court order. He averred that with the delay of one year in hearing matters, bail applications have been pending in the High Court for three years. He urged the Bench to allow him to argue the matter.Grover sought to file an additional affidavit highlighting Sen’s deteriorating health. The Bench allowed Grover to file the additional affidavit within a period of two weeks. It also directed the respondents to file the reply affidavit within the same period.

    "headline": "Delhi court grants interim relief to man in property dispute case, says possession considered ninth point of ownership",
    "data": "A Delhi court has granted interim relief to a plaintiff in a property matter on the grounds that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. The order was passed recently by Disha Singh, Civil Judge, West, Tis Hazari Court on an application filed by plaintiff Mangal Singh under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 of Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). The court further restrained Defendant No. 1 Raj Kumar from forcibly entering, creating any third party interest and trying to dispossess the plaintiff from the property located in Pandav Nagar, Delhi.The court noted that in the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.Advocate Aanchal Buddhiraja, appearing for the defendants, including defendant no 1 Raj Kumar, submitted that they have no objection if the application was allowed and a status quo was maintained over the suit property. However, the court noted after perusal of the application that the said application has been filed seeking interim relief against the defendant, thereby restraining the defendant from creating any third party interest in the suit property and dispossessing the plaintiff from the suit property till the final disposal of the suit.It said it was an admitted position between the parties that the plaintiff was in the possession of the suit property. The present suit has been filed seeking the relief of declaration of ownership, permanent and mandatory injunction against the defendant. It said prima facie perusal of the material available on record filed by the plaintiff transpired that the plaintiff has filed certain relevant documents in the form of gift deed dated March 19, 2010, GPA in favour of the plaintiff dated September 14, 2009, certain police complaints. The plaintiff sought mandatory injunction to the effect that the defendants may be directed to hand over the chain of title documents of the suit property being the owner.The provision under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC provided relief of interim injunction to preserve the suit property and prevent multiplicity of the proceedings between the parties, restraining the defendants from doing any acts by taking law in their hands, which may render the suit infructuous and further to protect the interest of the party whose legal rights were being infringed, noted the court. It said at the stage of deciding an interim application, this Court was required to consider the existence of prima facie case, preventing irreparable loss to the party aggrieved and in whose favour the balance of convenience of equity and justice stands tilted.In the present matter, the very lis was with respect to seeking declaration of ownership on the strength of certain documents filed and certain documents, which are within the possession of the defendants. Further, the plaintiff was in possession of the suit property and it was a settled law that possession was considered as the ninth point of ownership. Without getting into the merits of the case, the Civil Judge said she was of the opinion that the plaintiff has triable issues against the defendant and the balance of convenience required that in the interim, the peaceful possession of the plaintiff was protected so that the suit was not rendered infructuous. Further, the scale of balance of convenience was tilted in favour of the plaintiff, so much so that if the interim relief was not granted to the plaintiff, the same may cause irreparable loss and extreme hardship, in case the defendant side dispossessed the plaintiff or created any third party interest in the suit property.The Civil Judge, while allowing the application filed by the plaintiff under Order 39 Rule 1 & 2 CPC, listed the matter for February 19, 2024 for admission/denial and framing of issues.The court noted that the matter was received back as ‘non-starter’ from the Mediation Centre. It further noted that the cost imposed vide order dated September 18, 2023 was paid by the defendant to the plaintiff side. Regarding another application filed by the defendants under Order 8 Rule 1 A seeking to place additional documents on record, the Civil Judge allowed it on the grounds that issues have not been framed yet and the present matter was at the preliminary stage only. Advocate Gagan Gandhi, appearing for the plaintiff, submitted that they have no objection if the same was allowed since the additional document was an FIR against the plaintiff and in any way it would be a matter of record.The Tis Hazari Court noted that an affidavit of admission/denial has been filed on behalf of both the sides. Perusal of the said admission/denial transpired that no reasons have been assigned by either of the parties while denying the documents. The Civil Judge granted liberty to both the parties to file additional affidavits of admission/denials assigning the due cause while denying the concerned documents.

    "headline": "Southern Fury",
    "data": "Following strong opposition from southern states, the country’s top medical education regulator, the National Medical Commission (NMC), has gone back on its decision to restrict the number of MBBS seats to 100 per 10 lakh population in every state. The new regulation, which was notified on August 16, had barred all five southern states from increasing their medical seats for the next academic session (2024-25).According to media reports, at least 13 states and UTs, including all five southern states of Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Karnataka and Kerala, have more than 100 seats per 10 lakh population. The new NMC norm would have directly affected them. The Under Graduate Medical Education Board had issued Guidelines under Regulation 10 of the Establishment of New Medical Institutions, Starting of New Medical Courses, Increase of Seats for Existing Courses & Assessment and Rating Regulations 2023 and Regulation l9 of the Graduate Medical Education Regulations 2023.According to the notification, “these regulations are to prescribe for a medical college and Medical Institution approved for admissions of MBBS students annually, the minimum requirements of accommodation in the college and its associated teaching hospitals, staff (teaching and technical) and equipment in the college departments and hospitals”. The regulations were meant to be applicable to medical colleges being established from 2024-25 onwards. Some of its provisions were:(1) Applications for establishing new undergraduate medical education colleges shall be allowed only for 50/100/150 seats.(2) Only colleges meeting these requirements shall be eligible for continuing their admission of permitted/recognised number of MBBS students from 2024-2025.(3) Colleges seeking an increased number of seats cannot exceed a total of 150 MBBS.(4) Colleges seeking an increase in seats shall have admitted batches fulfilling all the criteria for the preceding academic year and also shall be fulfilling all the requirements for increase in seat capacity.(5) With the exception that colleges who have applied for the academic year 2023-24 for increased seats, but failed to get it, can ask for the same number (totalling 200 or 250) that was in their previous application.(6) After 2023-24, a letter of permission for starting a new medical college shall be issued only for an annual intake capacity of 50/100/150 seats, provided that it follows the ratio of 100 MBBS seats for 10 lakh population in that state/UT.Every hospital seeking permission to start a medical college after the publication of this amended regulation shall comprise the medical college, attached teaching hospital/(s) and hostels for the students and interns, with or without the residential area for faculty and other staff. The medical college, hostels for students/interns and the teaching hospital/institution shall be either in a unitary campus or a maximum of two campuses. Each unitary campus shall have adequate constructed area on the land, as per the prevalent building norms, belonging to the college management or if on lease, at least for a period of 30 years on lease.If there are two plots/campuses, then the college shall be in a single plot. The distance between the plots of the college and hospital shall have a travel time of a maximum of 30 minutes. The hospital shall have at least 220 beds. There should be adequate accommodation for the principal/dean, college council, academic and examination sections, accounts and other administrative offices (as per the need), the medical education unit and the server room for the computer network. The college council shall comprise the head of departments as members and the principal/dean as chairperson.The council shall meet at least four times in a year to draw up the details of curriculum and training programmes, enforcement of discipline and other academic matters. There shall be a central library (preferably air-conditioned) with good lighting and adequate space for stocking of books and journals.However, on August 23, the NMC put on hold its notification. The new guidelines, the National Medical Commission Registered Medical Practitioner (Professional Conduct) Regulations, 2023, had made it mandatory for doctors to only prescribe generic drugs. The NMC in its latest notification further said that Registered Medical Practitioners (RMP) will have to follow the rules and regulations notified in the Indian Medical Council (Professional Conduct, Etiquette and Ethics) Regulations, 2002.On August 2, the NMC had passed the following guidelines:The NMC’s regulations have been opposed by doctors ever since it was notified. The doctors said that the quality of generic drugs in India is poor and prescribing them may put the patients at risk. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Faking It",
    "data": "Recently, Rajasthan Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot said that nearly 56% of criminal cases against women in his state were concluded as fake during the probe. While commenting on the services of the state police, the chief minister also said that nobody had the right to tarnish Rajasthan’s image in relation to safety of girls and women.Alleging that Opposition parties had spread rumours about rapes occurring frequently across Rajasthan and that crime rates had increased too, Gehlot asked his critics to refer to the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB). He said that while the NCRB showed that Rajasthan topped the list in instances of rape, it also listed a “rise in crime” and an “increase in registration of cases by police”. He said criticism should be based on facts and correct data.Last month, the Special Crime Branch of Goa Police uncovered an inter-state racket involving girls from economically weak backgrounds who were being allured to file false rape cases. Under the pretext of providing escort services, the girls used to contact clients and if they failed to pay, they threatened them with rape. Against some targets, they even managed to get rape FIRs registered.There are numerous cases of men being falsely accused of rape all over India. In November this year, the Kerala High Court acquitted a father who was in jail for a year and a half for molesting his minor daughter. The FIR was registered on his wife’s complaint, but was found to be false. In another case, the Kerala High Court directed the police to take expeditious legal action against a woman for making a false rape complaint against a junior health inspector after having consensual sex with him.In October this year, a sessions court in Dewas district of Madhya Pradesh convicted a 45-year-old woman for a fake rape complaint and fabricating evidence. The court pronounced her guilty of framing her 33-year-old nephew-in-law in order to seize the property. The punishment was ten years’ rigorous imprisonment.In June 2023, a Delhi woman and her male friend, who runs an NGO, were arrested on charges of extorting money from at least 12 men after threatening to implicate them in fake rape cases after honey-trapping them on dating apps.In May 2023, a Delhi court directed the police to file an FIR against a woman who filed a false rape case against her father-in-law. The court came down heavily on her for making a false claim. It all started on October 24, 2019, four years after the incident, when the woman posted a photo of Sarvjeet Singh on Facebook, alleging that he had sexually harassed her. The court dismissed the charges and Singh was held innocent. The woman didn’t appear in court for the hearings despite repeated summons. The post went viral on social media garnering widespread attention.In March this year, a 22-year-old woman was arrested for falsely accusing two men of gangraping her and extorting Rs 2 lakh from them for withdrawing her complaint. The woman worked as a web designer with a Noida-based private media Management Company.In 2021, while declining to quash a rape case compromised by the complainant and accused persons, the Delhi High Court said that false claims and allegations of molestation and rape need to be dealt with an iron hand due to the serious nature of the offences. Justice Subramonium Prasad also said that the false allegations of rape have the potential to destroy the life and career of the accused.Vishnu Tiwari, a UP man, was arrested on September 16, 2000, for rape and atrocities under the SC/ST Act. However, in January 2021, he was pronounced innocent by the Allahabad High Court. Then there was the case of a 24-year-Mumbai resident who spent over two years in jail for allegedly repeatedly raping his 16-year-old sister. He was later acquitted by a POCSO court in Dindoshi after the minor said that she had lodged the FIR against him in anger and was tutored by her boyfriend. The girl said that she was upset that her brother was always reprimanding her for going out with her boyfriend and for trying to convince her that he may cheat her.With so many false rape cases flooding courts, in 2021, a PIL was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the Union of India to reconsider the misuse of laws under Sections 354A-354D, 506, 509, 376, 498A of the IPC and to make gender-neutral laws as these laws were made more than 150 years back. Many were contrary to Articles 14, 19 and 21 of the Constitution.According to the petition, the laws discussed in the PIL were made in 1860, 1956, and 1983—an era when women did not really have much of a say in anything. But laws should be dynamic and keep pace with the evolving social milieu. They should be amended from time to time to keep up with the changing times.In the PIL, the petitioners highlighted the case of a Lucknow girl who was seen slapping a cab driver in a brutal manner just to gain publicity. Similarly, two sisters in Rohtak had beaten three boys with belts accusing them of harassing them. But it was just a ploy to gain popularity and when the truth came out, the boys were all acquitted by the court on March 3, 2017, but their life, honour and dignity were ruined in the eyes of society.In the same year, a plea was filed in the Supreme Court seeking directions to the centre to frame guidelines for payment of compensation to victims of wrongful prosecution and to implement the recommendations of Law Commission Report No 277 on miscarriage of justice. The petitioner highlighted laws of various countries which comprehensively dealt with miscarriage of justice and provided compensation to the victims of wrongful conviction. He said that the UK had incorporated the obligation of Article 14(6) of ICCPR into its domestic legislation—Criminal Justice Act 1988—under Part XI subtitled “Miscarriages of Justice”. Sections 133, 133A and 133B provide compensation to a person who has suffered punishment due to wrongful conviction. Section 88 of the UK Police Act, 1996, deals with “Liability for wrongful acts of constables” and vicarious liability of the State for tortuous acts of the police.The Supreme Court bench of Justices BR Gavai and JB Pardiwala said that while rape causes the greatest distress and humiliation to a victim, a false allegation can cause equal distress, humiliation and damage to the accused and he must be protected against such implication. —By Shivam Sharma and India Legal Bureau Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "Innocent No More",
    "data": "By Dr Swati Jindal GargIt has been assessed that juvenile crime is not naturally born in a boy, but is largely due either to the spirit of adventure that is in him, to his own stupidity, or to his lack of discipline, according to the nature of the individual. This nature is built on several premises which include the experiences that were faced by the juvenile while growing up, the support system that he had and also to a large extent, the kind of person who mentored him. While it is true that juveniles are influenced by their family and environment, but in the end, it is they who chose to commit a crime out of variety of options. Luckily for society, not everyone resorts to crime because of their predicaments. There are many reasons like family environment, mental disorder, social disorganization, etc., because of which a teenager commits a crime and when he/she repeatedly commits a crime they become juvenile delinquents.Juvenile delinquency, which is also more popularly known as criminal activity by children below the age of 18 years, is a topic of much discussion and incidents like the latest one involving the murder by a 16-year-old boy makes one recall many other heinous crimes that have been committed in the past by other juveniles. The Nirbhaya gangrape case that shook the nation in December 2012 tops the list.The latest “Crime in India” report published by the National Crime Records Bureau for 2018 states that a total of 31,591 crimes committed by juveniles were reported in that year. Maharashtra alone accounted for 19% of these cases. Not far behind, Madhya Pradesh accounted for 16.6% of the crimes. Incidentally Madhya Pradesh reported the greatest number of such cases in 2017. Delhi with 8.6% of the cases was third in the list. The top 10 states together accounted for 81.7% of the cases in 2018.The study also shows that a majority of the crimes committed by juveniles were offences affecting human body and property. This included hurt and grievous hurt (47%), rape (13%) and assault on women (12%), among many others.Studies have shown that the most common reason behind juveniles committing crimes is their education followed by the kind of parenting that they get. According to Healy and Bronner, the major causes for juvenile crimes are “bad company, adolescent instability and impulses, early sex experience, mental conflicts, extreme social suggestibility, love of adventure, motion picture, school dissatisfaction, poor recreation, street life, vocational dissatisfaction, sudden impulse, and physical conditions of various kinds”. However, in India, it is poverty and the impact of the media, particularly social media, that encourages youths to engage in illegal activity.The 2018 data reveals that almost 45% of the juveniles involved in these cases were educated between matriculation and higher secondary while about 28% had education up to primary level and 9% of them were illiterate. The studies also show that 99.3% of the juveniles involved in these cases were boys and around three-quarters of them were aged between 16 and 18 years. Shockingly, a total of 382 juveniles or about 1% of all were below 12 years of age. The past 15 years have witnessed an increase by about 65% in the number of crimes committed by juveniles, with the year 2016 topping the list. Thereafter, the number has decreased by 6% each year. Over a period of years, various studies have also identified various symptoms that define a child offender. These are:Apart from the Nirbhaya case, there have been many other shocking cases of juvenile crimes in India that have come to light and the fact remains that most of them remain undiscovered or even unreported.In the year 2013, a gang of five minors had dramatically escaped from a city juvenile home amid riots and burning, and murdered a jeweller’s wife and decamped with 50 kg of silver jewellery and Rs 10 lakh in cash. In 2015, a shocking incident of two youths accused of rape after kidnapping an infant in Nangloi had come to light. Then, there was the December 2015 case wherein three borderline juvenile gunmen opened fire in a chamber at the Karkardooma Court complex in New Delhi, killing a police officer. This was followed by another case in 2016 wherein two juveniles allegedly shot an Uber driver in the Mundka area and fled with the car after dumping the body.The law as it stands today states that the maximum sentence for juvenile offenders is three years and this sentence is applicable to both serious and minor offences. In case of an adult, the highest penalty that may be imposed is seven years in jail, life in prison, or death sentence. But all these heinous crimes raise several mind boggling questions—how is someone so young capable of murder? How can a young child cut off another child’s arms and legs? And how and why is it that he won’t go to prison at all?Taking note of this discrepancy, it was argued in the Nirbhaya rape case that the accused’s age should not be used as a shield in the light of the heinousness of the cruelty he perpetrated on the victim. In this case, the accused was found to have physically tortured the woman with an iron rod, hurled obscenities at her and caused internal ruptures in her body. In the final decision, the juvenile was left free after completing his assigned term of imprisonment by the court. A PIL was then filed in the Delhi High Court, demanding amendments to the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2000, to deal with “juveniles who have reached the age of 16 and commit significant crimes, have well-developed minds and do not require society’s care and protection. Rather, society requires care and protection against them”. Considering the increasing number of crimes that are being committed by juveniles against women, including sexual harassment, rape, acid attacks and violent killings, Section 18(3) of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 came into play which says that if the juvenile is found to have committed a heinous crime and is over the age of 16, a juvenile board—comprising a metropolitan magistrate or a judicial magistrate and two social workers—will have the discretion to decide whether the offender should be tried by courts of law like adults, or whether the offender should be tried as a juvenile. As per the law: “The board shall conduct a preliminary assessment with regard to his mental and physical capacity to commit such offence, ability to understand the consequences of the offence and the circumstances in which he allegedly committed the offence… for such an assessment, the board may take the assistance of experienced psychologists or psycho-social workers or other experts.”However, a major loophole in this is that the boards could very well be pressured by the media trial that follows most of such cases and allow themselves to be influenced in determining which 17-year-old is child-like and which is adult-like. As a result, sending such delinquents aged between 16 and 18 years to adult prisons for seven years or more will likely ensure that there is little chance of their reformation.There is no doubt that the purpose of juvenile law is to provide a structure where troubled kids can reform themselves and mature into better citizens. Even though the Indian legislature is working hard to improve the situation in India when it comes to juvenile crime and the laws that govern it, a lot still remains to be done. Although records show that juvenile crime has decreased in recent years, there are still several issues that must be addressed.The government is taking steps to provide adequate education, good entertainment and proper homes for children and it cannot be denied that the journey towards addressing the actual root cause of juvenile delinquency has just begun. Juvenile crime prevention not only requires, but also necessitates active collaboration between all the key stakeholders—governmental agencies, educational institutions, law enforcement agencies, courts, social workers and non-profit groups. —The writer is an Advocate-on-Record practicing in the Supreme Court, Delhi High Court and all district courts and tribunals in Delhi Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "A Sahara-sized mess",
    "data": "By Sujit BharWith the death of Subrata Roy, the Sahara India group supremo, on November 14 in a Mumbai hospital after prolonged illness, the refund status of the thousands of crores duped from investors by several companies in the group has created a complete mess.While the Sahara-Sebi Refund Account (SSRA) now boasts of a Rs 25,163 crore corpus (as of March 31), it is being said that in the 11 years since the refund account was created, hardly any claimants had come forward. It is also being said that the government is thinking of moving all unclaimed funds—an amount that could touch Rs 20,000 crore—to the Consolidated Fund of India (CFI).What is to happen to the money if it is moved to the CFI from the SSRA is another matter, but at this point one needs to know the status of this entire shadowy scenario.It has been said that over a period of 30 years, there had been an inflow of around Rs 1 lakh crore from 7-8 crore investors into the coffers of different Sahara group companies, and majorly through two companies—Sahara India Real Estate Corporation and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation. The shadiest part of all is that these investors have never been identified in a single place. The collection carried out by Sahara as a non-banking finance corporation on different schemes, had never seen any oversight from the Union finance ministry, or the Securities and Exchange Board of India or the Reserve Bank of India or the Serious Fraud Investigation Office. It was also not investigated by the Ministry of Cooperation (which was formed in July 2021), whose mi­nister is Amit Shah, also the Home Minister.It has to be noted that the Rs 25,000-odd crore in the fund is actually the total of the Rs 15,000-odd crore that Sahara had deposited (against a demand of Rs 25,000 crore), plus interest accrued. Sahara was asked to deposit Rs 25,000 crore, against which the company managed to deposit Rs 15,000-odd core. The court called up Roy and, as a result of a contempt proceeding, Roy had to spend time in jail.Later, the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies received a transfer of Rs 5,000 crore from SSRA, intended to be used for paying genuine depositors’ legal debts. To expedite the refund process, Amit Shah set up a special portal for Sahara depositors.That sounded pretty hollow in the face of what had happened during the 11 years that the total fund was available from the SSRA. In those 11 years, SSRA was able to identify and pay 17,526 applicants involving 48,326 accounts, but the payout was of only Rs 138 crore.It is said that either depositors failed to produce the right documents, or their applications were found faulty, or they did not even know the existence of this fund. Sahara had collected this massive amount through micro investments from farmers, rickshaw pullers, small-time workers, people who were mostly illiterate and had no idea of the scale of the Ponzi scheme. It would be too much to expect proper paperwork from these people, mostly from rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar.Three things follow. The first is that the Central Registrar of Cooperative Societies portal, which now holds Rs 5,000 crore for disbursal, needs on-portal submissions and Amit Shah made it clear that pre-requisites, such as Aadhaar card, PAN and bank account (all linked) are must. This seems a prescription for another failure and it is unlikely that all of Rs 5,000 crore will be properly disbursed. Also, it has to be remembered that many of the depositors had paid a maximum of Rs 1,000 in deposits. In wanting to avail of that amount (and, probably, the small interest accrued therein) the applicants will have to pay for creating a proper Aadhaar, for resurrecting their defunct bank accounts, for linking them and much more.The second is the problem of the remaining Rs 20,000 crore. If the government takes that amount over to the Consolidated Fund of India, what would it be used for? Would it be used to wipe out a small portion of the large budget deficit? Would it be used in developmental programmes? Could it surreptitiously make its way into another opaque fund, providing a boost to the ruling party before the 2024 general elections? Or, could it even be simply lost in accounting?The third problem is bigger. It is not clear who the investors were, because no consolidated list has been kept. But it is somewhat sure that at least Rs 1 lakh crore of deposits had been taken in by different Sahara group companies. In that context, we are probably dealing with a small percentage of the deposits, even accepting that Sahara did pay back many of its investors of its own accord. What happens to the rest of the money?The biggest problem has been the accounts and of the overseeing authorities who have never cared to go out and try and collect all data.That leaves millions of investors out in the cold, never to see a single paisa of their investments come back. That also leaves the entire country’s slack financial system, in a state of limbo.It is small comfort to the small investors that Madhabi Puri Buch, chairperson, SEBI, has said that the Sahara matter will continue for the capital markets regulator even after the death of Roy. That, obviously, aligns with a special court’s refusal to dismiss the case against Sahara India Real Estate and other criminal matters being investigated by SEBI, just because Roy is now dead.In the end, as things stand, India’s regulatory muscle and intent are being seen in poor light. That does not augur well for the country. Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment. "

    "headline": "Triple Talaq: Supreme Court to hear petitions challenging Muslim Women Act in March 2024",
    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday listed a batch of petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, which criminalised ‘triple talaq,’ for hearing in March 2024. Earlier on April 26 this year, the Central government had apprised the Apex Court that despite its 2017 verdict declaring the practice of triple talaq as unconstitutional, reports showed that it was still being practised in different parts of the country. Filing an affidavit in response to the petitions challenging the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta said the verdict in Shayara Bano case did not lead to any decrease in the instances of triple talaq, since it very much existed in different parts of the country.The SG stressed on the need for state intervention to help victims of such divorces, stating that despite the Constitution Bench judgment in Shayara Bano case and assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. The SG apprised the Apex Court that Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act 2019 was introduced to protect the rights of married Muslim women being divorced by way of triple talaq by criminalising the Act with imprisonment up to three years.He said despite the Constitution Bench’s judgment in Shayara Bano case, setting aside the practice of talaq-e-bidat, and the assurance of the All India Muslim Personal Law Board, there have been reports of divorce by way of talaq-e-bidat from different parts of the country. He noted that the Apex Court judgement of 2017, wherein it set aside talaq-e-bidat, has not worked as any deterrent in bringing down the number of divorces by this practice among certain Muslims. In order to give effect to the order of this Court and to redress the grievance of victims, the Union government introduced the 2019 Act, said the SG.He further said that even though the All India Muslim Personal Board had agreed to prescribe the guidelines introduced in the Shayara Bano case to control the practice of Triple Talaq, media reports showed that the practice continued unabated.On August 22, 2017, in the Shayara Bano vs Union of India and Ors case, the Apex Court had declared ‘talaq-e-bidat’ or any other similar form of talaq having the effect of instantaneous and irrevocable divorce pronounced by a Muslim husband as unconstitutional.On July 31, 2019, Parliament passed the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Act, 2019, criminalising the pronouncement of divorce in such a manner and prescribing a punishment of up to three years imprisonment for the same.A bunch of petitions had challenged the constitutional validity of this Act before the Supreme Court, alleging that it was violative of Articles 14,15,21 and 25 of the Constitution.The affidavit said that despite the victims of Triple Talaq approaching police for redressal of their grievance, the latter was helpless as no punitive action could be taken against husbands indulging in the practice, even though it had been declared unconstitutional by the Apex Court. It further said that before this Act was passed, the only recourse available to Muslim women was the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, which was ineffective against the instantaneous and irrevocable practice of talaq. This created a need for a standalone legislation penalising the practice, it added.The SG questioned the maintainability of the petitions on the ground they challenged the validity of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Marriage) Bill 2019, which has now become an Act, thus making the matter infructuous.He said the Court’s power was limited to assessing the constitutionality of the legislation and that it had no power to go into the ‘wisdom of measure’. The affidavit by the Union of India also said that the court cannot interfere with a legislation that has made punishable an act that the Court has already declared to be violative of Article 14 of the Constitution.The SG said the Act protected the rights of married Muslim women, who were being divorced by triple talaq. It further helped in ensuring the larger constitutional goals of gender justice and gender equality of married Muslim women.The Act helped in subserving the fundamental rights of non-discrimination as also their empowerment, it added.(Case title: Amir Rashadi Madani vs Union of India) Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Skill development scam case: Andhra Pradesh moves Supreme Court against regular bail to TDP chief Chandrababu Naidu",
    "data": "The government of Andhra Pradesh has filed a petition in the Supreme Court against the Andhra Pradesh High Court order granting regular bail to Telugu Desam Party (TDP) chief and former Chief Minister N Chandrababu Naidu in the Skill Development Programme scam case. The state government contended in the plea that the High Court had delved deep into facts of the case and rendered findings which were not only factually incorrect, but were also likely to prejudice the trial against Naidu.It added that the practice of detailed elaboration of evidence in bail orders has been repeatedly deprecated by this Court.As per the Andhra Pradesh government, while professing not to conduct a ‘mini-trial,’ the High Court ended up conducting a ‘trial of allegations,’ the veracity of the contentions, the reliability of the documents placed by the Prosecution Agency and the evidence-worthiness of the same while seeking to rule on the plausibility of allegations at the stage of grant of bail.On November 20, the single-judge Bench of Justice T Mallikarjun Rao had granted bail to Naidu on the grounds that there was no prima facie evidence to prove that the misappropriated amount in the scam case worth Rs 371 crore was diverted to the bank accounts of TDP.The High Court noted that the petitioner was arrested on September 9, 2023 and had remained in judicial custody till being granted interim bail on health grounds on October 31, 2023, following the court’s orders.Earlier on October 31, the High Court had granted interim bail to Naidu for four weeks on medical grounds in the Andhra Pradesh State Skill Development Corporation (APSSDC) scam case.The single-judge Bench of Justice T. Mallikarjuna Rao granted interim bail to the TDP chief till November 28 for his treatment including cataract surgery.The High Court directed Naidu to submit a surety of Rs one lakh and not to influence anyone related to the case. He was further told to surrender on November 29.The single-judge Bench further listed the regular bail petition of the 73-year-old TDP leader for hearing on November 10.Naidu was arrested by the State Criminal Investigation Department (CID) on September 9 in connection with the Rs 300 crore APSSDC scam case. It was alleged that Naidu, in connivance with others, caused a loss of Rs 300 crore to the state exchequer in the name of setting up a skill development centre.He is currently lodged in the Rajamahendravaram (Rajahmundry) central prison.On October 30, the State CID registered another case under the Prevention of Corruption (PC) Act against Naidu in connection with illegal permissions given to liquor companies in the state when he was the Chief Minister. He has been named as accused number three in the case. The State CID apprised the Vijayawada ACB Court about this latest case on October 30. This is the fourth case registered against Naidu since he was arrested by CID on September 9.Earlier on October 9, the High Court had refused to grant bail to the former chief minister in connection with three different cases registered against him regarding corruption and riots.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy dismissed the regular bail petitions filed by Naidu in connection with the Angallu violence case and the Inner Ring Road alignment change case, along with the anticipatory bail plea in the AP Fibernet Grid case.It was alleged that the master plan of Amaravati capital city, alignment of the inner ring road and the seed capital were manipulated during Naidu’s regime, in order to provide undue enrichment to several companies.On September 11, the State CID had filed a Prisoner Transit (PT) warrant petition against Naidu in the Amaravati Inner Ring Road. It filed another PT warrant petition against Chandrababu Naidu in the FiberNet scam.The investigating agency had accused Naidu of exerting pressure on officials to favour a certain company that was awarded the FiberNet contract, despite its alleged lack of necessary qualifications. As per the State CID, the work order for the first phase of AP FiberNet Project worth Rs 321 crore was allotted to Tera Software in violation of rules and by manipulating the tender process. The project was aimed at providing optical fibre connectivity to villages and towns across the state.The High Court had earlier granted anticipatory bail to Naidu on October 13 in connection with the Angallu violence case. As per the case, incidents of stone pelting, arson and rioting took place during a political rally taken out by the TDP chief at Angallu village in Annamayya district on August 4.The single-judge Bench of Justice K. Suresh Reddy had reserved its verdict on October 12 after hearing arguments from both sides in the Angallu violence case. Mudivedu police had registered a case against Naidu following the incident. The State CID had opposed Naidu’s bail plea on the grounds that his remarks were responsible for the violence in Angallu village.Despite getting anticipatory bail in the Angallu violence case, Naidu continued to remain in judicial custody in connection with other cases.A team of specialist doctors visited the Rajamahendravaram central prison on October 12 to examine Naidu’s health after he complained of skin allergy.

    "headline": "Pick and Choose",
    "data": "By Justice Kamaljit Singh GarewalThe Indian Constitution allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. This very simple and uncomplicated power has been provided in Article 222 of the Constitution. From 1950-1976, there was not a single case of transfer of a High Court judge. Suddenly, during the Emergency, transfer of judges began. The general public perception then was that it was a part government policy to get more commitment from judges to support its socialist policies. If you were suitably socialist, you may stay at home. If you were independent-minded, you packed your bags.Within a period of two years, 16 High Court judges were transferred from one High Court to another using the power of transfer. Three judges who had been appointed from the judicial service as additional judges were not confirmed. They had to revert to their previous posting as district judges.Nevertheless, large scale transfer of High Court judges was unprecedented. For 26 years, no transfer had been effected. Then suddenly, someone discovered the president’s power to transfer judges, and 16 were sent packing. The government tried to justify these transfers on the plea of national integrity (whatever that means) and removal of narrow parochial tendencies (a vague, undefined concept). Judges being gentlemen, quietly went to the new places feeling rotten inside. As the phraseology of Article 222 stood, neither was the consent of the judge necessary, nor the opinion of the chief justice binding on the government. It was a pure executive act, a shameless invasion on the independence of the judiciary.On November 21, The Indian Express published an article headlined, “Don’t Pick & Choose Judges, SC tells Centre”. It must be extremely painful for the government to be told that when dealing with judges’ appointments and transfers, it cannot “pick and choose”, but simply do what the Supreme Court has decided according to the Memorandum of Procedure. It was reported: “In Punjab, two senior most candidates have not been appointed. This is the problem which arises when selective appointments take place, people lose their seniority. Why will people be ready to become judges?” asked Justice Sanjay Kishan Kaul, who is a member of the apex court Collegium.The same news item also reported on the delay in transferring Gujarat judges. On transfers, Justice Kaul said: “Last time also, I said (it) doesn’t send a good signal. If you pick and choose transfers out of the ones recommended by the Collegium, ultimately they are going to work in one court or the other. It’s not a question of choice of the judges to be appointed. Last time also, I emphasised don’t do selective transfers. It creates its own dynamics, and that is what has happened. One from Allahabad, one from Delhi, and some from Gujarat, six transfers are pending. This is something not acceptable….As per my information, you have issued transfer orders for five judges. For the rest, you have not issued; four of them are from Gujarat,” he added.And on disturbing the seniority of judges in Gauhati, the paper reported: Senior Advocate Dushyant Dave, appearing for a petitioner, said that in Gauhati HC, the Collegium refused to administer oath to the judge whose name was recommended while another senior’s name was withheld. “Ultimately, the government cleared (it), and the Collegium under the Acting Chief Justice gave oath,” he said. Justice Kaul recorded the court’s “appreciation” of what happened in Gauhati HC and also commended the government “that it took cognizance of it and did something”.Strange indeed are the ways of the law minister bordering on defiance. A list of five names is sent to his ministry for appointment as judges, but only three are appointed. In another instance, a list of names is sent for transfer, but only some judges are transferred while others are not. The law minister seems to say, it’s my way or the highway. Under the Memorandum of Procedure (MoP), pick and choose for appointment and transfer of judges has already been done. The government cannot pick and choose again from those picked and chosen. This in a country of 1.4 billion people which prides itself as a democracy governed by the Rule of Law.The Memorandum of Procedure (MoP) regarding appointment and transfer of judges has laid down elaborate steps which must be followed meticulously. Appointment of judges is by the president under Article 217 of the Constitution. The names are sent up by the chief justice after consulting his two senior most colleagues regarding the suitability of the names proposed. The proposal is then sent to the chief minister and the governor with the full set of papers. The governor then forwards the papers to the Union law minister, within six weeks of receiving the proposal. The minister considers the recommendations in the light of such reports as may be available to the government in respect of the names under consideration. The complete set of material is then forwarded to the chief justice of India who consults his two senior most colleagues and forms his opinion with regard to the person to be recommended for appointment to the High Court. After consultations, the chief justice of India sends his recommendation to the law minister, who then puts it to the prime minister, who would then advise the president and the notification issued.Transfer of judges from one High Court to another is also by the president under Article 222. The proposal is initiated by the chief justice of India whose opinion is determinative. Transfers are made in public interest for promoting better administration of justice throughout the country. The chief justice is expected to take into account the views of the chief justice of the High Court from which the judge is being transferred and the chief justice of the High Court to which the judge is being transferred. The views of one or more Supreme Court judges, who are in a position to offer their views, are also considered. The views of the chief justice of India and four senior most judges should be expressed in writing. The personal factors relating to the concerned judge, including the chief justice (of a High Court), and his response to the proposal, including his preference of places, should invariably be taken into account by the chief justice of India and the first four puisne judges of the Supreme Court before arriving at a conclusion on the proposal.The proposal for transfer of the judge, including the chief justice of a High Court should be referred to the Government of India along with the views of all those consulted in this regard. After the recommendation of a transfer is received from the chief justice of India, the law minister sends the recommendation along with relevant papers to the prime minister who will then advise the president as to the transfer of the judge concerned. After the president approves the transfer, the Justice Department issues the necessary notifications in the Gazette of India.During the emergency, Justice Sankalchand Himatlal Sheth of the Gujarat High Court was transferred to Andhra Pradesh without his consent. He joined the place of transfer, but filed a writ petition in the High Court. The matter came ultimately before the Supreme Court as Union of India vs Sankalchand and another and was decided on September 19, 1977, by a five judge bench consisting of Chief Justice YV Chandrachud, Justice PN Bhagwati, Justice Krishna Iyer, Justice Untwalia and Justice Fazl Ali, by a majority of 3:2 (J. Bhagwati and J.Untwalia were in the minority).The Supreme Court realised that while the Constitution promoted the democratic value of independence of the judiciary, the executive could use the power of transfer of High Court judges to undermine judicial independence. But as regards the interpretation of Article 222, the Court was divided 3:2. The minority took the view that to preserve judicial integrity and independence, the word “transfer” in Article 222 should be interpreted to mean only “consensual transfer”, i.e., transfer of the judge with his consent and not otherwise because transfer constitutes a stigma on the judge and is very inconvenient to him. On the other hand, the majority took a more literal view of Article 222 and held that this Article did not require the consent of the judge to his transfer from one to another High Court. As a safeguard against misuse of power by the executive, the majority ruled that “consultation’’ with the chief justice as envisaged by Article 222 had to be “full and effective consultation” and not a mere formality. The opinion given by the chief justice would be entitled to the greatest weight and any departure from it would have to be justified by the government on strong and cogent grounds.Again, the question of transfer of High Court judges was raised in S.P. Gupta vs. Union of India (AIR 1982 SC 149). Bhagwati, J., reiterated the minority view in Sankalchand that a judge could not be transferred without his consent. In any case, he said that the transfer of a judge could be exercised only in public interest and that transfer by way of punishment could never be in public interest. He emphasised that “whenever transfer of a Judge is effected for a reason bearing upon the conduct or behaviour of the Judge, it would be by way of punishment”. Transfer being a serious matter, the burden of sustaining the validity of the transfer order must rest on the government. In the instant case, Bhagwati, J., ruled that the transfer of the chief justice of the Patna High Court to Madras High Court was bad because: (1) there was no full and effective consultation between the central government and the chief justice of India before the decision was taken to transfer him.(2) transfer was made by way of punishment and not in public interest.Fazl Ali and Desai, JJ., joined Bhagwati, J., in holding the transfer to be bad. These judges, however, did not agree with Bhagwati, J. in his view that under Article 222, for transfer, the consent of the judge would be necessary. On the other hand, the majority view was that the transfer of the chief justice was valid. The consent of the judge was not necessary for purposes of his transfer. Still the power of transfer vested in the central government was not absolute, but subject to two conditions: (i) public interest.(ii) effective consultation with the chief justice of India. An order of transfer would become a justiciable issue and be liable to be quashed if—(a) it was not in public interest; (b) it was passed without full and effective consultation; (c) if the opinion of the chief justice was brushed aside or ignored without cogent reasons. This is excerpted from page 408 of M.P. Jain’s Indian Constitutional Law Sixth Edition 2010 edited by Justice Ruma Pal & Samaraditya Pal, Senior Advocate. Of course, now things have drastically changed. Transfers are very common and there is a well laid down procedure which seems to be just and fair to the judiciary and individual judges, but its constitutionality is doubtful.Article 222 allows the president to transfer a judge from one High Court to another. There was no such power with the King-Emperor under the Government of India Act, 1935, which was federal in nature. Therefore, the power to transfer was a new provision introduced in the Constitution. Whether this is a good practice which improves the administration of justice is an important question. It must be looked at holistically. High Courts are a part of the state judiciary. They are each Courts of Record. They exercise superintendence and control over a vast network of trial courts in the state. It’s easy to see that our judiciary is essentially federal in character. Therefore, transfers of judges impinge on judicial federalism, separation of powers in the state(s), and are violative of the basic features doctrine. The concept of transfers is unheard of anywhere else. One never hears of a judge from Texas being transferred to California or a judge from England getting transferred to Scotland. In India, you can’t transfer the Speaker of Tamil Nadu (head of the state legislature) to Rajasthan. In the same way, it doesn’t make sense to transfer the chief justice of Allahabad (head of the state judiciary) to Bombay. Transfers also create many hurdles stemming from lack of knowledge of language, ignorance of local laws and practices, sharing the bench with total strangers and unfamiliarity with the Bar. May be at some future date, the transfer policy will be undone. But for the coming years, it is here to stay.—The writer is former judge, Punjab and Haryana High Court, Chandigarh and former judge, United Nations Appeals Tribunal, New York Save my name, email, and website in this browser for the next time I comment.

    "headline": "Addicted to Credit Rating",
    "data": "By Sujit BharCredit rating (scoring) is a very unhappy and unfair way of measuring the worth of a person, even his or her financial worth. Credit histories, as they are created, are tailored on pre-fixed matrices and it is a one-size-fits-all approach that banks like a lot, because that allows them to treat humans as commodity. Credit rating a human being is possibly one of the most degrading and dehumanising practices of the modern world.In our so-called modern societies, in the cities of India, you need to have been a well-behaved boy to avail of that good credit candy from Santa Claus banks. What you are, your education, your service to society, your goodness of heart, all boils down to your credit score that CIBIL decides without your knowledge and certainly without your permission. Privacy can wait.Before going ahead, we need to know what CIBIL is. CIBIL stands for Credit Information Bureau India Limited. If that sounds pretty official and somewhat government-ish, it is not. It is a credit information company engaged in the maintenance of records of all credit-related activities of individuals and organisations.This company, Transunion CIBIL Limited, is a non-government company, incorporated on Aug 21, 2000. It is a public unlisted company and is classified as a company limited by shares.And what is TransUnion? While Trans­Union CIBIL Limited is a credit information company operating in India, maintaining credit files on 600 million individuals and 32 million businesses, it has partnered with an MNC giant, TransUnion, which is one of four credit bureaus operating in India and is part of TransUnion, an American multinational group.It is not clear how much classified information that TransUnion CIBIL gathers from within the borders of India is shared with TransUnion. Think of the complete opacity and the arrogance with which this credit rating company operates.For a credit rating company to gain any rating itself, the banks and other financial institutions have to fall in line. And they do, with alacrity. Then they try to spread the theory of rating across the landscape, even to farmers and that too, with a government scheme. Remember, your banking history, your transactions, your loans, your financial history in short, is quietly shared by the banks and other financial institutions with this private credit rating company. Do you remember ever giving your bank the permission to share these details? I guess, not.Such an attempt was recently thwarted by the Kerala High Court. The Court clearly stated: “By no stretch can the farmers, who effectively sell grains to the government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) Scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank.” The Court added that farmers availing of the PRS scheme were not borrowers, and whatever the effect of this scheme on the farmer’s finances, it should never affect the credit ratings of the farmer.The Court was forced to issue the clarification on being informed of a farmer’s suicide after he failed to secure payments for paddy procurement and also because of treatment meted out to him by a bank.This clarification was issued by Justice Devan Ramachandran. The judge said: “I reiterate that by no stretch can farmers, who effectively sell grains to the Government under the Paddy Receipt Sheet (PRS) scheme, can ever be construed to be borrowers by any bank, because it is only since the government requires time to make payment against it, that they are forced to avail such facility. Normally, therefore, it cannot affect their credit rating either.”The Court said in its November 15 order: “The judgment of this Court is explicitly clear in its tenor that a farmer under the ‘PRS Scheme’ cannot be construed as a borrower in any manner whatsoever—whether the loan has been availed prior to its issue or after—the fact remains that there appears to be a doubt whether the consortium of bankers are still construing them so, thus creating an impact on their credit rating.”The Court did not stop at that. It also emphasised that banks cannot require farmers to execute security documents or impose borrower-like conditions to secure payments.Desperate farmers had approached the Court, claiming that despite the Court’s earlier ruling on the issue, they were still being treated as borrowers by banks, affecting their credit ratings. Farmers, therefore, cannot go to the banks again for loans that they desperately need for fresh cropping.Harassed by banks, one farmer has committed suicide.Advocate Santosh Peter, the standing counsel for the Kerala State Civil Supplies Corporation (Supplyco), replied that these apprehensions were unfounded since under the “PRS Scheme, the borrower is the ‘Supplyco’” and not the farmers. This was, obviously a technical escape route, but the Court was not to be taken for a ride. The Court has asked Supplyco to inform the banks that they cannot treat farmers as such and that a farmers’ credit rating cannot be impacted by PRS loans.According to an IMF paper, “One of the earliest takeaways from the global financial crisis was the importance of access to information for effectively functioning financial markets. And, in that regard, credit ratings can serve an incredibly useful role in global and domestic financial markets—in theory.“In practice, credit ratings have inadvertently contributed to financial instability—in financial markets during the recent global crisis and more recently with regard to sovereign debt. To be fair, the problem does not lie entirely with the ratings themselves, but with overreliance on ratings by both borrowers and creditors.”The report quotes a background paper for the Fall 2010 Global Financial Stability Report which said that “regulators should reduce their reliance on credit ratings. Markets need to end their addiction to credit ratings.”The solution is that credit ratings “should be seen as one of several tools to measure credit risk, and not as the sole and dominant one.”There is where the one-size-fits-all approach fails to achieve its purpose and results in fatalities, such as the farmer’s suicide.This ruling of the Court should set a precedent that financial institutions should adhere to.

    "headline": "“Foreign Tie-ups Will Make NLUD a Leading Law University”",
    "data": "Prof (Dr) GS Bajpai, the new V-C of National Law University (NLU), Delhi, has plans to make the institute a leading law university by promoting empirical research and national and international collaboration. He spoke to Sanjay Raman Sinha on his priorities and visionSanjay Raman Sinha (SRS): You have been appointed Vice-Chancellor of the prestigious National Law University Delhi. What is your vision for the institute?Prof GS Bajpai (PB): NLU, Delhi, has an illustrious legacy in terms of quality research, publications and international collaborations. My focus will be to promote empirical research, diversify areas of research and encourage national and international collaboration. Regarding the curriculum, I want to make it more inter-disciplinary and in tune with the guiding principles of the National Education Policy 2020. Altering the legal pedagogy and improving the engagements with all stakeholders is another priority.SRS: What are the initial initiatives you plan for the betterment of NLU Delhi?PB: In the short-term, priority areas include better resource allocation within the university, rationalisation, better utilisation of funds, updating the curriculum and bringing new projects in cutting-edge areas. In the long-term, my aim would be to strengthen the position of NLU Delhi as a leading law university by focusing on research and publications and developing new-age pedagogy and a community-and-industry-linked curriculum.SRS: How are NLUs different from other law schools?PB: I cannot comment on other NLUs, but I can say that in NLU Delhi, students get a different experience as compared to students in other law schools. Being situated in Delhi, the seat of the Supreme Court and High Court, gives it a unique edge. Delhi also has the top Tier-I law firms and is home to many legal luminaries. Thus, NLU Delhi students have rich exposure. Moreover, our pedagogy, curriculum, and research ethos are very competitive and challenging. This makes our law programmes one of the best in the country.SRS: How satisfied are you with the existing curriculum? What changes can be made?PB: NLU Delhi can boast of a curriculum that is not only academically rigorous and challenging, but meant to broaden the intellectual and critical horizons of the students. We lay emphasis not just on classroom learning, but learning that happens outside the class. We make sure that our students are exposed to subjects and theories from other disciplines that are critical in developing a broader understanding of the law. Thus, we have several seminar courses which expose students to non-traditional subject choices like Energy Laws & Policy; Law, Society and the Queer; Feminist Political Theory; White Collar Crimes in India–Law; and Analysis, Healthcare and Life Sciences. Going forward, our aim is to draft our curriculum on global standards. We also want to increase the focus on clinical education. While we already have clinical courses running on campus, their structural and systemic growth will be our focus.SRS: NLUs are held to be elitist, especially due to the high fee structure. What can be done for deserving but financially weak students?PB: I am aware of this impression that has been created. However, it is not accurate. One of the objectives of NLU Delhi is to make legal education accessible and we have been consistently striving towards that end. We have students from all financial backgrounds and from socially disadvantaged regions and geographies. NLU Delhi stands firm on its commitment to ensure that it remains a free and open space where opportunity is equally distributed among students, irrespective of where they come from. We have scholarships for meritorious students and we also provide full fee-waiver on a case-to-case basis. We believe that no deserving candidate should have to withdraw admission on account of lack of resources.SRS: NLUD is known for its research ethos. You also have a strong research background. What work is going on and what more needs to be done?PB: NLU Delhi has played a pioneering role in research. Our autonomous faculty-led research centres have done commendable work on socially relevant issues such as death penalty (under Project 39A), climate change, cyber law, Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) (under CIIPC), regulatory studies, Artificial Intelligence, tech and data protection. Our aim will be to incorporate newer areas and make its corpus of publications more diverse. Also, we want to increase collaboration with foreign universities, think tanks and civil society groups so that we can create a much larger impact.SRS: With globalisation, law studies have become challenging. NLUD has some tie-ups with international universities. What needs to be done to keep the studies in tune with international law?PB: NLU Delhi has tie-ups with some leading global universities such as SOAS University of London, University of Melbourne and University of Antwerp among others. These associations foster better exchange of ideas and culture, lead to research and curriculum development and provide exposure to our students and faculty."

    "headline": "CJI Chandrachud talks of camaraderie among lawyers, says Constitution tells us we can either survive or perish together",
    "data": "Chief Justice of India D.Y. Chandrachud on Thursday said that the Constitution taught the citizens a very important lesson, that people can either survive or perish together.Inaugurating the Constitution Day celebrations organised by the Supreme Court, the CJI said that in this cycle of existence, no one can stand alone and that everyone was bound to be together.He shared that one of his colleagues was recently diagnosed with dengue and needed blood transfusion. The blood donated earlier by the members of the judiciary was given to the person, so that he could return to normalcy. The CJI said that more than 2000 court employees had launched a blood donation this morning.He revealed that on Wednesday, he was dealing with a fraud case. The CJI said that fraud cases tend to increase during elections, after which they settle down. As elections come closer, the Court becomes a sight for political engagement, he added. In this case, Solicitor General Tushar Mehta and Senior Advocate Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi were arguing for their respective clients. The CJI said he told his colleagues to dictate the judgement right there for transparency. He saw the SG going across to talk with Dr. Singhvi. For a moment, the CJI said, he thought they were joking about him. He said it gave away the essential nature of the legal profession. It was a profession of diversity, in terms of gender, caste and region.Lawyers may have different ways of dressing, food preferences, religions, ideologies and identities, but all of them were essentially one, which was also reflected through their attire. Their attire was black & white and sober, a symbol of the tradition that they shared, he added. The CJI said that it was for the members of the judiciary to ensure that they truly made their chambers inclusive. They should encourage people with different ideas and different thoughts and also encourage young lawyers to join judicial service, he added. It was important to learn to discharge one’s duties to the cause of justice, which ranked much higher than success or failure in individual cases. He told the lawyers that they don’t have to merely protect the judges, but hold them to account as well. He said one hallmark of SCBA was that all judges of the bar came from different parts of the country for a better livelihood, but also to make the lives of citizens better. Lawyers have this one big responsibility. The ability to change the lives of Indian citizens. The ability not to be tied down by one dogma or doctrine. They take a long time to build but only moments to sacrifice. So seniors have to pass on these messages to younger members of the bar. He said he shared stories with his clerks to convey what he learnt from his own life.Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal attended the event as Guest of Honour. Attorney General of India R. Venkataramani, President of the Supreme Court Bar Association Dr. Adish C. Aggarwala and Vice-President of SCBA Sukumar Pattjoshi, among others, were present on the occasion.

    "data": "The Constitution of India frames the rights, principles, procedures, restrictions and duties of the government as well as the people of India. Speaking to lawyers across the country at an event organised by Asia Pacific Lawyers Group, senior Supreme Court advocate and a prominent bar leader Ashok Bhan wished the citizens of India all over the globe a happy Samvidhan Diwas.He said this day is a reminder to us that while Constitution gives rights to the citizens, frames principles, procedures, restrictions and duties for the government, at the same time it casts duties on citizens to follow the rule of law.To safeguard democracy, Bhan said people must have a keen sense of independence, self-respect, their unity and oneness, and should insist upon choosing as their representatives only such persons who are honest, grounded, good, truthful and with firm faith in Constitutionalism.Bhan said two independent countries came into being on the sub-continent on August 14 and 15, 1947. India has been a successful democracy and Constitutionalism has stood the test of being in active practise through institutions. The Indian judiciary has evolved as the apex custodian of protection of Human Rights and a check and balance for any colourable usage of executive powers. The Constitution declares India a sovereign, socialist, secular, democratic republic, assuring its citizens’ justice, equality, and liberty and endeavors to promote fraternity. The Indian Constitution stood the test of time as India has been a successful democracy, unlike many other countries which had become independent at the same time.Bhan said Constitution Day is observed every year in India. The day is also known as Samvidhan Diwas or National Law Day. Constitution Day is celebrated to commemorate the day when the Constitution of India was adopted.The National Law Day highlights the significance of the Indian Constitution in governing the country. Indians share Constitutional Day and Samvidhan Diwas wishes.Since 2015 when the Government of India issued a gazette notification, this day is being celebrated as National Law Day. The year also marked the 125th birth anniversary of Dr Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, the chief architect of the Constitution of India.He further says, the National Law Day commemorates the pledge of Purna Swaraj, passed in the Lahore session of the Congress in 1930.

    "headline": "Gauhati High Court directs Director for Secondary Education Assam to give a due consideration to specially abled child",
    "data": "The Gauhati High Court directed the Director of Secondary Education, Assam to give a due consideration to the representation of the petitioner by further providing that in doing so, the Director shall take note of the legal right of the specially abled child of the petitioner under the law of disability and do the needful and in doing so, the Director shall not consider the representation to be a regulation representation of an employee seeking transfer and posting at a given particular place.The petitioner was initially serving as Planning Assistant in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. By the order of the Director of Secondary Education, Assam dated 22.07.2022, the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer and upon promotion was posted in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Golaghat. It is stated that on 22.07.2022 when the petitioner was promoted to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, no vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer was available at Nagaon and accordingly for exigencies of service, the petitioner was required to be posted at Golaghat.A Single Bench of Justice Achintya Malla Bujor Barua noted that the petitioner is also the father of a specially abled child who is presently stated to be aged about 16 years. A certificate of the Director of Health Services, Nagaon, is available on record wherein the son of the petitioner had been certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).As per the certificate of disability, the Court noted that the son of the petitioner is a specially abled child who requires special care and attention of the petitioner as the father. Upon promotion to the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Golaghat, the son of the petitioner was inconvenienced to the extent that the ‘care giver father’ had to be separated from him because of his service conditions.In this circumstance, the respondents by taking a sympathetic view had allowed the petitioner to be attached to the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon. It is stated that in the meantime, one post of Planning and Statistical Officer in the office of the Inspector of Schools, Nagaon had fallen vacant and in the circumstance, the petitioner has made a representation dated 29.05.2023 making a prayer that he may be transferred and adjusted in the vacant post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. It is also stated that at present, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer, Nagaon is vacant and no one is occupying the post. Although the petitioner had raised certain other assertions in the representation that his wife is also suffering from certain medical ailments and requires surgery, for the purpose of determining the present writ petition we are not required to go into such assertions. However, the Court noted that the petitioner is the father and caregiver of a specially abled child who is certified to be suffering from 50% permanent disability due to intellectual disability (moderate).The right of a specially abled child to have the comfort of a caregiver father had been recognized by the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in the their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014, wherein it had been provided that there has been a demand that a Government employee who is the caregiver of the disabled child may not have to suffer due to displacement by means of routine transfer/rotational transfers etc. and considering the matter in its entirety, the Government of India in the Ministry of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions in their office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 provided that in a case where a Government employee would be a caregiver of a specially abled/disabled child, such employee should not be subjected to any displacement in course of his employment which may have a bearing on the systematic rehabilitation of the specially abled/disabled child. The said office memorandum dated 06.06.2014 is stated to have been also adopted by the Government of Assam.In the instant case, the Bench noted that the specially abled child of the petitioner is presently aged about 16 years and he has been provided the systemic rehabilitation under the facilities available at Nagaon inasmuch as, prior to the promotion and transfer the petitioner was all along posted at Nagaon.A conclusion would be arrived at that the specially abled child of the petitioner has a legal right under the law of disability to have the benefit of his caregiver father to be with him without any resultant displacement due to his service conditions. In other words, to provide a place of posting to the petitioner at Nagaon, we are of the view that it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have his caregiver father near him at Nagaon so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered ,the Bench observed.“We are clarifying it to the aspect that this is not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, but on the other hand, it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him so that his systematic rehabilitation process is not hampered. From such point of view, there is a requirement under the law of the respondents to give a due consideration to the representation dated 29.05.2023 of the petitioner Padma Kanta Borah requesting that he be given a place of posting as the Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon. “As it is a legal right of the specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him and not a legal right of the Government employee to have a place of posting of his choice to be near the specially abled child, the representation of the petitioner has to be considered not from the point of view of the principles that may be applicable while deciding the claim of a Government employee for a place of posting or transfer, but on the principles of the legal right of a specially abled child to have the caregiver father near him , the Bench further observed.The Bench noted that even the respondents or any other Government employee may not be inconvenienced if the petitioner is given a place of posting at Nagaon inasmuch as, the post of Planning and Statistical Officer at Nagaon is presently vacant, where in any view of the matter for administrative exigency the departmental authorities would transfer and post some employee at Nagaon.

    "headline": "Mediation was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of British: Chief Justice NV Ramana",
    "data": "Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute, resolution and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.New Delhi, Jul 23 (ILNS) Mediation was a practice that was commonly followed in India prior to the arrival of the British, and their Court system. Not only did the British establish the framework for the modern Indian judicial system, but they were also instrumental in the creation of myth that dispute resolution, and justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments, Chief Justice of India NV Ramana said.Speaking at the inauguration of the eight-day International Virtual Mediation Summer School, 2021 organised by Nivaaran-Mediators of Supreme Court of India on Thursday, the Chief Justice said mediation is one of the most important conflict resolution mechanisms currently, which will only continue to grow in relevance in the coming future.“It is time to dispel the myths and notions that justice requires black coats and gowns and elaborate arguments. The reality is that most of the litigants in India suffer from many social and economic constraints. What they need is a quick, inexpensive and convenient method of dispute resolution. Mediation is one such mechanism available to parties to a dispute. Apart from the fact that it is cost-effective, time saving and convenient to parties, there is another facet of mediation that marks it out as perhaps a better alternative for parties. Traditional litigation often leaves one of the parties to the proceedings dissatisfied with the result, which is why parties sometimes appeal decisions all the way to the Supreme Court. This often compounds the problem of judicial delays. This is an outcome of the “winner-takes-all” attitude that has come to affect the system, said Justice Ramana.The CJI emphasized the role of training It must also be remembered, being a successful lawyer does not guarantee similar success in mediation. These two distinct roles require distinct characteristics. A mediator needs to be perceptive to the emotions of both the parties, as well as the underlying issues. Even, with the most stubborn parties, the mediator must guide parties with great optimism and patience to find a workable settlement. Mediation, as a tool of grievance redressal which is cheaper, faster and simpler, can ensure just and fair outcomes, he said.Mediation signifies a shift from an adversarial attitude or position and creates an atmosphere that focusses on better outcomes for all parties. It enables parties to contemplate a continued relationship after the end of the resolution process.The CJI said that the Supreme Court has played an active effort to improve mediation in India and has played a crucial role in bringing mediation into the mainstream. Various judicial pronouncements by the Supreme Court of India have, among other things, resulted in the creation and spread of Court annexed mediation in the country.Apart from this, the Supreme Court Mediation and Conciliation Project Committee, which was set up in 2005, has been integral when it comes to the training of Mediators in India. The first batch of mediators was trained nearly a decade ago and a fresh batch was trained in May 2019Addressing the law students who participated in the 10 day Summer School for the training of skills of Mediation, the CJI said, I believe that education is one of the most important tools to not only empower people, but to effect change in the society. To this extent, organizing an event such as the present one where eminent mediators, lawyers, judges and jurists have the opportunity to speak their thoughts on various topics and impart information and knowledge to foster new understanding among students and practitioners is invaluable.The future belongs to mediation. Law students and young lawyers need to learn the requisite skills and be at the forefront of creating the space for the establishment of Mediation, and Mediators, as a separate profession. The Court system needs full time, qualified mediators with necessary skills to convince parties to arrive at an amicable settlement.The role of law schools and law school curriculum should also not be underplayed. While the Bar Council of India mandates a course on Alternate Dispute Resolution, more focus should be placed by law schools in the country on clinical education, with a focus on Mediation.Justice Ramana said, I had flagged some issues during the India-Singapore Mediation Summit regarding the difficulties that mediators face during conflict resolution. The first issue related to the role of a Mediator- which is now shifting to a more active, engaged role as opposed to the facilitative role which was earlier envisaged, and how a Mediator must act in such situations. The second, relates to what a Mediator must do, or how “neutral” a Mediator must be, in the face of a patently unjust settlement reached between parties in unequal bargaining positions. Such issues require a Mediator to be well trained and equipped to understand and be prepared to react to any situation that arises before him. This can only happen if there is a well-designed training programme for Mediators in place with a focus on situation recognition and the appropriate response. The Supreme Court Mediation and ProjectCommittee has already created a model Training Programme wherein 40 hours of training and participation and successful completion of a certain number of mediation is mandated for accreditation as a qualified mediator. However, it is necessary for the training programme to be constantly updated and modified, to keep up with the best practices in the rest of the world. We should also be innovative and think of how new technologies, The CJI said.Others present at the function were Justice Vasheist Kokaram,Judge Court of Appeal, Trinidad & Tobago, Mr Brian Speers, President Commonwealth Lawyers Association. Senior Advocate and mediator Rajiv Dutta gave the welcome address. Mediator Asha Gopalan Nair and Senior Advocate Suruchi Aggarwal conducted the one and a half hour long program on Virtual Platform.The 8 Day Summer School will have eminent speakers and trainers including District Judges Sudhir Jain, Sunil Aggarwal and Eminent lawyers from, Delhi, Chennai, Bangalore and other places."
