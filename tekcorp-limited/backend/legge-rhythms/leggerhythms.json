Social construction and bonding being more grounded in our country, the institution of marriage holds much more noteworthy significance here. Living together without marriage is viewed as untouchable and is exceptionally uncommon. Be that as it may, as of late, things are changing quickly and couples have begun living together in a single-family even without being hitched. Such a relationship might be brief or may continue for a significant timeframe. If the dwelling together continues for a delayed period, it is named a live-in relationship.The live-in relationship can be defined as Continuous living together for a huge timeframe, between accomplices who are not hitched to one another in a legitimately satisfactory manner and are sharing a typical family.LEGALITY OF LIVE-IN RELATIONSHIPSA live-in relationship between consenting adults is not considered illegal under Indian law. In the case of Lata Singh v. State of U.P(2006),.[i]it was held that a live-in relationship between two consenting grown-ups of the other gender, however, saw as improper, doesn’t add up to any offense under the law.In another important case,KhushboovsKanaimmal&Anr;the Supreme Court noticed “However the idea of live-in relationship is considered unethical by the general public, yet is not unlawful according to the law. Living together is a right to life and along these lines, it can’t be held illicitly.”[ii]In the event that live-in relationships continue for an extendedperiod and a few present themselves to society as spouse wives, they get perceived as being lawfully hitched.As early as 1978, in Badri Prasad Vs Deputy Director Consolidation,the perception was made that “If man and woman who lives as a couple in the public arena are constrained to demonstrate, after 50 years of wedlock by onlooker proof that they were truly hitched fifty years sooner, hardly any will succeed. A solid assumption emerges for wedlock where the accomplices have lived together for a long spell like a couple. Albeit the assumption is rebuttable, a significant weight lies on him who tries to deny the relationship of its lawful origin. Law inclines for authenticity and frowns upon bastardy.”[iii]The same observation was made in SPS BalasubramanianVsSuruttayan,in which it was seen that where a man and a woman live together as a couple for quite a while, the assumption under the law would be agreeable to their being lawfully hitched to one another except if demonstrated unexpectedly and children conceived out of such live-in relationship would be qualified for inheritance in the property of the guardians.[iv] In the event that such a relationship is just for sexual reasons, neither of the accomplices can guarantee the advantages of a lawful marriage.In “IndraSarmavs VKV Sarma,”the Supreme Court was of the view that all live-in relationships are not relationships in the idea of marriage. In this specific case, it was tracked down that the appealing party, having been completely mindful of the way that the respondent was a hitched individual, couldn’t have gone into a live-in relationship in the idea of marriage, since it has no inherent or fundamental attribute of a marriage, yet a relationship other than in the idea of marriage.[v]The Court additionally mentioned the following objective facts for this situation.Before 2018, homegrown dwelling together of a wedded or unmarried man with a wedded woman established a criminal offense of “adultery,” yet for the man just, under Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC).But this section was annulled by the Supreme Court of India in the case of Joseph Shine vs Union of India in September 2018, as the Court came to the conclusion that it was violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India. The segment treated people inconsistent as just the man and not the woman who is dependent upon arraignment for infidelity. Besides, it was just the spouse of the concerned woman who could indict the one who was involved in the demonstration and the woman can’t arraign her better half for adultery.[vi]However adultery is presently not a criminal offense, the issue of living together with any wedded man or woman might involve common issues constituting a ground of separation, wherein case it would be sexually unbiased.ACTS RELATED “Palimony” is a combined type of world “pal” and “alimony.” Though the specific suit was ineffective, the courts tracked down that “without an express understanding, courts might look to an assortment of different solutions for partition property fairly.” It was seen that in case there is a living together arrangement for the couple before moving in together, the Court might think about an award of palimony. In India, the requirement for such alleviation was felt by the Malimath Committee on Criminal Justice which suggested revision in the definition of “spouse” in Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr. P.C.) to include ladies who were living with the man as his better half for a sensibly extensive period of time.[vii]Section 2(f) of Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (PDV Act, 2005) defines a homegrown relationship as “a relationship between two people who live or have lived together, any time of time, in a common family, when they are connected by consanguinity, marriage, or through a relationship in the idea of marriage, reception or are relatives living all together with family.” According to this definition, live-in relationships which are in the idea of marriage, that is, the couples are living for an extensive time period and present themselves as husband and spouse go under the ambit of the PDV Act, 2005. Consequently, the woman in a live-in relationship can take security under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 and can guarantee maintenance moreover (D. Velusamyvs D. Patchaiammal).[viii]The question of application of the PDV Act, 2005 to the live-in relationships came into the consideration of the Supreme Court in the case of “LalitaToppovsthe State of Jharkhand.”It was held that the person in question, that is, the alienated spouse or the live-in accomplice would be entitled to help under the Act in a common family.[ix]While referring to this report in Ajay Bhardwaj vs Jyotsna, the court awarded alimony under the PDV Act, 2005 to a woman in a live-in relationship[x].In any case, just the woman can guarantee maintenance under the PDV Act, 2005. Help under the PDV Act, 2005 isn’t accessible to men in live-in relationships. In this association, it is pertinent to refer to that for the case of Khushboo versus Kanniamalthe Court saw that “a live-in relationship is invariably initiated and propagated by men.Rights of Children Born Out of Live-In RelationshipIn Tulsa vsDurghatiya,[xi]the Supreme Court, while granting the right of property to a child, seeing that children brought into the world from the live-in relationship would not be treated as illegitimate if their folks could have lived under one rooftop and lived together for a significantly extensive period to be perceived as a couple and it should not be a “stroll in and leave” relationship. Area 16 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 and Section 26 of the Special Marriage Act, present authenticity to children conceived out of the void and voidable relationships by providing that children conceived out of marriage, which is invalid and void or where a declaration of nullity is allowed in regard of voidable marriage, will be legitimate or considered to be legitimate, individually.Yet, according to Subsection (3) of similar segments of the Act, the right of inheritance of such children is restricted to the property of the guardians as it were. Consequently, such children don’t have the coparcenary rights in the property of the Hindu unified family (HUF) if their folks did not legitimately marry one another. Accordingly, the arrangements of these segments of the Act have been applied to give a right of inheritance to the children conceived out of live-in relationships in oneself obtained property of the guardians. However, on the off chance that their folks are not lawfully hitched to one another, they can’t guarantee the coparcenary rights in the property of the HUF of their dad. Claiming maintenance under Section 125 of the Cr. P.C is well within the privileges of ward children conceived out of the live-in relationships, as the actual segment explicitly refers to “both legitimate and illegitimate kid.” In the question of deciding for guardianship, the mother is viewed as the normal gatekeeper for such children.CONCLUSIONLive-in relationships give couples a more noteworthy chance to know one another better along with the opportunity to cut off the friendship according to their desire. However, they need to confront numerous social and lawful obstacles. The Supreme Court has given guidelines for regulating such relationships and for protecting the privileges of ladies involved in the relationship and kids conceived out of it, which has been depicted previously. Social qualities and standards have changed for the new age. The live-in relationship might be alright in certain conditions yet the significance of the institution of marriage for maintaining the social request can’t be denied.This article is edited by Dhruv Kapoor, FIMT, affiliated to GGSIPU.[i]Lata Singh vs State of U.P. & Another (AIR 2006 SC 2522) .

Along these lines, a live-in relationship of a wedded man with a woman or of a wedded woman with a man can’t be perceived as in the “nature of marriage” as it is explicitly denied by law. Nonetheless, children conceived out of such a relationship, however not viewed as legitimate, would include every one of the rights inside the boundaries as portrayed beneath.Grant of Alimony and Application of the Prevention of Domestic Violence Act, 2005"

GNCTD: UNFAIR TO EXPECT CHILDREN ORPHANED DUE TO COVID TO PROCURE DOCUMENTS FOR AVAILING BENEFITS UNDER WELFARE SCHEMES: DELHI HCPROVISIONS UNDER WHICH INDIA CAN EVACUATE ITS CITIZENSAN INSIGHT INTO THE LIVES OF WOMEN BEHIND SECTION 377 JUDGMENTK.M. Nanavati Case: Three Shots That Shocked The Nation",
    "data": "This article is written by A.Siva Sangari from VIT ChennaiFACTS AND ISSUES BEFORE THE COURT:The court is concerned about the case of a family, having 7 children and due to covid; they lost both their parents this year.Kaur noted that the children, two of whom were older and one of the children was male and the other was women, it was difficult to meet their demands and that the Delhi government’s social security policy had not been implemented. Though the children were properly provided, with all the basic requirements and school textbooks by the child welfare committee, they still need a lot of care and support and are unlikely to be able to come to the committee repeatedly to meet their daily needs, requirements, and medication. Kaur went on to say that the brothers were given a one-time grant of ₹ 10,000 and offered a small job that one of them had to accept to meet their daily needs as no relative would take care of them.However, Attorney General Rahul Mehra from the Delhi Government has presented before the Court that the implementation of the ex-gratia compensation scheme of Rs.50000 is consuming a lot of time because there is so much of verification process and so many confirmatory details that are necessary to be done and due to this, the period lead to further delays in the payment of compensation under the welfare plan.Before moving to the court’s rulings, we should possess a necessary understanding of the motto of the juvenile justice act, 2015.INTRODUCTION OF JJ ACT-2015:The horrific incident of the “Nirbhaya Delhi Gang Rape Case”, on December 16, 2012, shocked the whole nation and many negotiations were started between legal and social organizations. The main reason and issue for the debate was the involvement of the suspects, who had only six months left to reach the age of 18. The defendant’s involvement in the heinous rape case forced Indian law to introduce a new law which is why the Indian Parliament introduced a new law known as Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection), 2015 and which came into force on January 15, 2016.MAIN FEATURES OF THIS ACT:OBJECTIVES OF THIS ACT:COURT’S RULINGS:The Delhi High Court on Monday ruled that it would not be appropriate for children, who lost one or both of their parents, as a result of Covid-19 to obtain documents to receive benefits under various social welfare programs established by the Delhi Government. Taking note of the issues regarding the verification process for such applications, Justice Vipin Sanghi and Judge Jasmeet Singh also directed the Secretary-General of the Delhi Government to submit a status report on the process of dealing with social programs under the Juvenile Justice Act. And the bench also expects the Secretary-General to dismiss these issues after holding a meeting with the relevant stakeholders including the Secretary-General of the Department of Women and Children and the Department of Social Development.Given the alleged incident, the Court said: “Since schemes have been set up to provide benefits to children, the government’s approach should be to act appropriately rather than to make such claims in the normal way.” Earlier, the Court issued several guidelines to the GNCTD to ensure compliance with the provisions of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 in the idea of protecting affected children. It is noted that the Delhi Government has not opened the truth by coming up with adequate measures to protect the rights of children and that there has been a complete overhaul of the Delhi Government departments.This article is edited by Dhruv Kapoor, FIMT, affiliated to GGSIPU, DelhiREFERENCES:A change in the name from JUVENILE TO CHILD in conflict with law is actually due to this amendmentThe amendment also describes children who are orphaned, devoted, and abandoned.And it makes mandatory that all child care centres must be registered.This act also provides the official CARA status.This act is the most important in the aspect of dividing the concept of children in conflict with the law and children in need of care and attentionThis practice greatly allows children between the ages of 16-18 to be prosecuted as adults if they are found guilty of serious misconduct.In each district, a juvenile justice board will be formed and a social welfare committee will be constituted.JJB’s task is to conduct an initial investigation to determine whether the offender should be referred for rehabilitation or trial as an adult.A child in need of institutional care and protection will be determined by the CWC.Under the previous Act, anyone who is a minor, regardless of how much crime he or she has committed, can only be sentenced to three years’ imprisonment. The case should not be tried in an adult court or sent to an adult prison or given a fine of more than three years. However, this changed with the 2015 amendment. All children under the age of 18 will be treated equally except for a single normal walk that is, in the event of a serious crime. Anyone who is 16 – 18 years old and accused of committing a serious crime can be tried as an adult. In this regard, the Juvenile Justice Board will look at the child’s physical and mental abilities, its ability to understand the consequences of crime, etc., and determine whether the child can be treated as an adult.The Central Adoption Resource Agency will set rules and regulations for the adoption of orphaned children. Intermittent adoption is allowed where no Indian adoptive parents are present within 30 days of the adoption of the child.The adoptive parents must be financially and physically sound. An unmarried or divorced person can take a child. An unmarried man cannot take a baby girl. Children with disabilities will be given priority to adoption.Children in need of care and protection may be allowed to be placed in a child care facility as per CWC instructions. The choice of adoption family is based on the family’s ability, purpose, strength, and previous childcare experience.It lays down a basic goal of administering justice to a child or child in actionThis act makes this action more sensitive to developmental needs in contrast to the justice system that works for older persons.It has risen the uniform age of boys and girls.It is present to ensure that the case is dismissed within four months thus guaranteeing the basic right to a speedy trial included under Articles 21 of the Indian constitution.It creates a new specialized police force with a sense of humanity and conscience by assisting and training police officers.Increasing juvenile access through JJB and CWC.To reduce stigma and compliance with the child’s developmental needs, it was advised to divide the act into two parts: a) Children in conflict with the law b) Children in need of care and protection.https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/delhi-high-court-says-asking-covid-orphaned-children-for-documents-for-benefits-under-welfare-schemes-unfair-180114https://indiankanoon.org/doc/92624381/"

    "headline": "UTTARAKHAND HIGH COURT TO EXAMINE PRISONERS’ RIGHT TO PROCREATEBreaking Stereotype: Right to Equality is for AllSC TO REFER PLEA OF A WOMAN TO ABORT HER 23-WEEK PREGNANCY TO A MEDICAL BOARDAn overview on Ranjit Thakur v Union of India",
    "data": "This Article is written by S. KarpagamIntroduction:Prison is the oldest penal colony known to mankind. The Penal Laws of each country provide for the punishment of persons for the removal of any act described as a crime in that country. Everyone enjoys certain rights because of their status i.e. human rights. In India, the extension of these human rights is provided to all citizens in the form of Fundamental Rights. These basic rights are granted to all citizens (certain rights and non-citizens) including prisoners. Judge Krishna Aiyer in the case of Charles Sobraj v. The Superintendent, Central Jail, Tihar has suggested that “Arrest does not constitute a waiver of basic rights even though, by actual re-examination, the Courts will refuse to accept the full complement of Part III by a free citizen”. Therefore, prisoners will only be deprived of the rights associated with punishment such as the right to travel, etc. And they are free to enjoy all other basic rights. When it comes to prisoners’ rights, ‘The Right to Life and Freedom’ is at an all-time high.A Bench of Chief Justice R.S. Cauhan and Justice Alok Kumar Verma were listening to an application by an inmate’s wife who was seeking temporary bail for the couple to start a family. His application was marked with Public Interest Litigation (PIL) by prison rules which were heard by the Court. The Court ordered the attorney JS Virk, Amicus Curiae, and the applicant’s attorney, Advocate Shaifali Singh, to inform the Court of the relevant policies in the area.Facts:The prisoner in question was sentenced to 20 years in prison, where he spent seven years. His wife argued that they had only been married for three months and that her husband had been arrested, so they could not start a family.Right to procreate:The right to procreate a convicted person falls under the right to life and liberty guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, read a Supreme Court decision on Tuesday, but adds that the state may deny the same to certain categories of prisoners because it is not a complete right. However, it should be regulated in accordance with a policy established by the State which may deny the same in the category or category of prisoners as the above-mentioned right is not a full right and under the interests of the State.Evolution of conjugal rights for prisoners by Cases:In the case of Francis Coralie Mulin and the Director, Delhi, the Court held that prisoners have the right to enjoy all the basic rights available to anyone who is free, except those deprived of the reason for their imprisonment. That marriage rights for prisoners were a right granted to prisoners was a matter that was brought before the Court. The answer to this question has changed over the years in a few cases.Jasvir Singh and anr v. State of Punjab and othersIn this case, the petitioners were a couple, guilty of kidnapping and killing a 16-year-old boy for ransom. The couple was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court and their appeal was rejected by the Supreme Court. However, the Apex Court has commuted the woman’s sentence to life imprisonment. Applicants prayed for the enforcement of their social and reproductive rights while incarcerated. They also pleaded that the Court should direct the prison authorities to allow them to live together for reproductive purposes. They also demanded that artificial insemination be an alternative. The main issue involved in this case is whether the ‘right to life’ found among the prisoners includes ‘the right to a joint visit’ and ‘the right to reproduce’. The Punjab and Haryana High Courts have ruled that the birthright is also available to prisoners. This right may be invoked in the case of prosecutions genuinely arising from non-political crimes or from acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations. The Court held that only the rights associated with detention will not be granted to prisoners and that as there is no connection between marital rights and imprisonment, prisoners have the right to enjoy those rights, subject to reasonable limits. The Court eventually found that Article 21 found among prisoners included their right to conjugal visit or to implant artificial insemination. And the Court ruled that the exercise of these rights would be in accordance with the Constitution.Law enforcement officers slowly entered the stadium and helped to improve the conditions of the prisoners. It adheres to the principles of Article 21 in all its stages of operation. It is said that while marital rights promote the right to life for the dignity of prisoners, it is difficult to exercise such rights in India where prisons remain overcrowded and without basic services available to prisoners. In the case of Meharaj v State of Tamil Nadu and the Ors, the trial court rejected the applicant’s application because the letter of the law governing the suspension of the sentences did not explicitly mention the marital rights of prisoners. The argument against union rights is that if such rights were granted, cells could become centers of prostitution. Also, having sexual intercourse between a couple and engaging in sexual intercourse in a cell would be a violation of their privacy.Observation of the court:The high court said it would re-examine the rights of the child born in such a state and tag the court’s application that we heard about prison rules. The court noted that such a child would be “deprived of a father” and expressed his intention to examine the rights of the prisoner’s wife. The child seems to have the right to live with the imprisoned father. The question, however, is, can we allow a child to be brought into the world whose upbringing will be difficult because the mother is a single parent… What about the psychological impact on a child who is asked to live without a father figure? Therefore, the Chief Justice said that the rights of the child need to be violated even if the child is not pregnant and has not been born.Conclusion:The family center is very much focused on Indian emotions. One of the most important issues raised by supporters is that by granting assembly rights, family ties do not end and remain strong. To maintain a proper detention system, it is important to grant marriage rights to prisoners because it helps to rehabilitate prisoners in line with the Indian code of punishment. The judiciary has played a role model in raising awareness of prisoners’ association rights. The landmark judgment of Jasvir Singh v State of Punjab CWP-4075-2019 has introduced a new aspect of ‘reproductive right’ and ‘right to visit a meeting’ and the right to health. This decision has taken a step forward in the recognition of the rights of prisoners. As they take the lead in the rights of prisoners in the international community, Indian courts are increasingly changing the living conditions of prisoners. The current legal framework that regulates prisoners has no provision for granting marital rights and such remands must be addressed immediately. Examining the benefits and restrictions on the granting of marital rights to prisoners, we conclude that those rights are desideratum.The case will come up for hearing again on August 31. The court has also directed an amicus curiae and another advocate to advise it on international legal practices on the issue, in places like the US, Canada, Australia and England.Citations:[Raghav Ohri], [Prisoners have Right to Procreate, says Punjab & Haryana High Court], [economic times], [2021][ Sagun Suryam], [ Uttarakhand High Court to examine prisoners’ right to procreate], [Bar and Bench], [2021][Shivangi Prakash], [Uttarakhand HC to examine Prisoner’s Right to Procreate], [Law insider], [2021]"

    "data": "This article is written by Vaasu Agrawal.The emblem of justice denotes that law is blind in itself. Law, though, is of utmost importance and utility for society to ensure the well-being of mankind. But, as it appears to us, it has come under the grip of a hard-core powerful people who actually control the law per se, repetitively, the law is blind in itself, and thus this so-called powerful section considers itself to be above rule of law. These self-acclaimed godmen or conmen escape the consequence of trespassing the law very easily and thus it appears as if the law is just enforceable against the less powerful section of society. Such sort of hegemony results in drastic wrecks on the dignity of law especially in the eyes of common people. This article deals with the issue that how justice is a puppet of some people and how numerous times it is being misused and propelled against innocents and they got the title of “Convicted” from being accused within no time. Miscarriage of justice is not just confined to the financial status of people, it has several other dimensions too, such as gender and political status. It has been many a time when a man got convicted for a crime that he never committed just on the pretext of a false complaint by a woman.As mentioned earlier, the consequences of a miscarriage of justice, especially criminal justice, are so drastic as it creates a sense of insecurity and disobedience in society. Dispensing justice is probably one of the toughest tasks. The apex court holds jurisdiction over the entire country and its verdict is non-challengeable and non-appealable. Thence the judiciary’s guardian i.e., The Supreme Court guarantees everybody’s right to justice and these miscarriages defeat this very aim of the judiciary.Justice is very vulnerable and can be very easily triggered by many factors. Hasty decisions taken by the court many times, in order to clear out pending cases and plea bargaining in cases of personal grudges between the victim and accused, as the alleged accused could be threatened by the victim of false accusations which makes the accused accept the false allegations charged upon him/her. There are a lot of instances of Judicial Misconduct, or Corrupt Judges who are often bribed by either of the powerful party so as to dispose of the proceedings. This is just a sheer mockery of justice and has horrendous consequences on society per se.With the advent of electronic media, though the delivery of news has become extremely fast but on the other hand, biased media houses tend to do an extra-judicial trial of an accused and portray him/her in such a way that the accused in most of the instances, is deemed to be a convict. Sunanda Pushkar’s case is one of the prominent examples of this stance, wherein Congress MP Shashi Tharoor seeks an injunction against Republic TV Editor, Arnab Goswami for broadcasting details of the death of Sunanda Pushkar. Added to that, Jasleen Kaur and Sarabjit Singh case is also one of the most highlighted benchmarks as Sarabjit Singh, the accused was harshly tried by media and how his entire life got messed up just because of false accusations by a girl. Moreover, corruption adorns such failures at the grass-root level. People having links and personal relations with politicians and highly powerful spokesmen, threaten the other party extra judicially. To sum up, there are a bulk of varied factors behind the setback to justice.It is true that in a democracy, the judiciary cannot guarantee a person for justice. When an innocent is held as a convict for a crime, it becomes quite hectic and difficult for him to lead life in a way that he used to have before being convicted by the court. In such circumstances, where it is duly proven that an innocent was convicted for a crime which he never committed, it becomes the responsibility of the state to ensure that his living conditions get restored and provide incentives for the person and his kins.When the rights of a person are violated and he/she consistently seeks justice, the person becomes mentally sick and feels harassed not only by the other party but also by the system itself. Nirbhaya Rape case (Mukesh and Anr. Vs State for NCT of Delhi &Ors[2]) is a well-known case in this regard where the victim’s family got justice after 7 years of crime committed when court-ordered death penalty of all the convicts. However, this highlights that there exists a number of loopholes in the judicial system as not all rape cases got the support and sympathy as Nirbhaya’s case.Though, over the years steps have been taken by the state in this regard and addressed by the courts as well. With respect to the financial burden, free legal aid is provided to the parties, not only for the prosecution but for the respondent as well. Lok Adalats which don’t have any extra court fee and are meant for speedier proceedings also work for dispensing justice.Curative PetitionIt was in the case of Rupa Ashok Hurra V. Ashok Hurra and Anr. [3]where the Supreme Court adopted a curative petition for the first time in order to prevent the occurrence of a miscarriage of justice. The court, in this case, has ruled that that curative petition can only be filed if the petitioner in the case can prove that there has been a contravention with the principles of natural justice. Along with this the burden of proving that the court was ignorant of the presence of curative petition while passing the verdict rests on the petition as well.Although curative petitions are taken under concern in exceptional cases being observed in open court hearings, it is one of the instruments of eliminating miscarriage of justice from occurring along with providing restrictions on the abuse of the power of the courts. The suffered party has a legal right to file an appeal to the court for reviewing its judgment for the second time in a row which must be made by following the rules as has been laid down by the court.Judicial ReviewIt is unarguably true that miscarriage of justice does not always occur through the verdicts of the courts, but can also result from the influence of the legislature and the executive pillars of the government. Several instances have occurred which proves that the influence of the executive and the statutes framed by the legislatures can put the judiciary in a dilemma as to what verdict is to be declared. Going by the safe side, the courts often fail to follow the path of justice and subsequently, leads to miscarriage of justice. In order to negate the same, the power of judicial review is provided to the judiciary so that the Constitutional validity of any statute may be checked and approved by the lordships.Curated by Kavana Rao, Symbiosis Law School, NoidaReferences https://blog.ipleaders.in/recent-instances-miscarriage-justice/https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/nine-stories-where-trial-media-wreaked-havoc-peoples-lives-133547https://prsindia.org/policy/report-summaries/wrongful-prosecution-miscarriage-justice-legal-remedies#:~:text=Miscarriage%20of%20justice%20refers%20to,which%20ended%20in%20his%20acquittal .https://www.scconline.com/blog/post/2018/09/08/wrongful-prosecution-miscarriage-of-justice-legal-remedies-law-commission-of-india-report-no-277/[1] Justice here implies righteousness.[2] Mukesh &Anr. v.

    "data": "This article is submitted by Rajat Pratap Singh of Amity University, NoidaINTRODUCTIONSince the outburst of the Covid-19 virus, the world has not been ordinary. Everything is either stopped or started working slowly. There has not been a single person who has not been affected by the virus. He has been harmed in some other way, either emotionally, mentally, or physically. There have been monetary losses as well.In the same way, marriages in the country are also affected. Many of us had to cancel our marriages or get the dates changed. There are many precautionary measures as well which we need to take during the ceremony. A recent judgment by the Supreme Court upholds the High Court’s decision that under the Special Marriage Act, 1954, marriages can be done through video conferencing.ISSUE WITH ONLINE MARRIAGESThe Delhi Government hasinformed the Delhi High Court that it cannot allow the registration of marriagesthrough video conferencing as the software required for the said purpose does not grant permission for the same. Marriage registration software is designed in the same way as the Aadhar application software, and the person who must get their pictures clicked should be present at that moment.The case was highlighted when the NRI married couple living in the US applied for exemption from the process. This was because they could not come face-to-face due to the travelling restrictions in the world due to the covid-19. The advocate said that the couple has applied for a green card and must submit their marriage registration certificate. For this reason, the couple has asked to appear through video conferencing mode. Justice Rekha Palli said that if it is legally permitted, then the software needs to be changed, and if not, she or the court cannot do anything in the matter. Later, after the judgement of the Supreme Court allowing online marriages through The Special Marriage Act, 1954, she allowed it.CASE There was a recent case where the couple got married according to the Hindu rites and rituals. They have applied for marriage registration under the Special Marriage Act, 1954. Both the respondents were living abroad, and it was tough for them to travel during Covid times. They raised the matter before the single bench of the Punjab and Haryana High Court. They gave the decision against them. Later they went to the division bench of the same court. The High Court termed the online marriage valid this time. Special Leave Petition was filed in the Supreme Court.The primary objection was that the High Court had considerably failed to consider and appreciate the necessary conditions laid down inSections 15 and 16 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 that makes it mandatory the physical presence of the involved parties before the issuance of a marriage certificate. It was also argued that the High Court did not give any valid reasons over the matter as to why the State’s submissions and, more importantly, the judicial precedents, in this matter, do not apply to the present case. The Respondents, in response, relied upon the Supreme Court’s judgement in the case of State of Maharashtra vs Dr Praful B. Desai (2003). They also argued that the laws could not be interpreted and imposed so that it creates inconvenience for the parties. The Supreme Court had listened to the matter very closely.The Supreme Court then held the Division Bench’s observations, and in this one, it was the correct decision.Then the Supreme Court accordingly dismissed the appeal petition as well. The Bench of Justices, which included Indira Banerjee and V. Ramasubramanian, stated that the law must march along with the innovation in the technology.Since the act was passed before any significant technological evolution, it can be reviewed now, and there should be necessary changes according to the situation. The Supreme Court stated that with the evolution in technology, there is the need to evaluate the laws and make some amendments. In these circumstances, the letters of the law cannot be interpreted rigidly. The court observed it. Further, the apex court also opined that the registration department is there to facilitate the parties to the marriage and not to create obstruction or hurdles.CONCLUSIONWe, humans, are going through hard times, and there is a need for we should step up and help each other in every possible way. The law is there for doing justice and making people’s lives more manageable and not more complex. In these trying times, we should make ways to make lives easier, and for that to happen, we have to take few necessary steps. The amendments in the law will be beneficial for the future as well. With the increase in technology with each passing year, we should make customary laws and increase our growth. The laws made way back in the 1950s would not be able to manage our lives presently. They need to be changed. With the change in the marriage law, there is no need to be physically available, and everything can be done through a webcam. It will save time and all the hardships that the couple has to undergo while travelling. It is very hard for couples living abroad to come to India just for the registration of marriage. With all sorts of travelling restrictions around the globe due to the pandemic, it further increases the struggle.REFERENCESThis Article has been curated by Manasvi Madhumohan of Symbiosis Law School, Punehttps://www.lawyersclubindia.com/https://www.livelaw.in/"

And the whole information was converted into writing. After completing the required formalities, the team was formed to judge the person who, according to a secret informant, was carrying narcotics.While the group was waiting near Gate number 1 of the metro station, a man was seen to be wearing the yellow sweatshirt whose description was similar to that of the secret details with a black shoulder bag.The person wearing a yellow T-shirt was given a small packet to someone wearing a black jacket and the black jacket person give a sum of money to the person wearing the yellow sweatshirt. On that point, both were caught by the NCB team again they were asked who they were, private information as well the purpose of the visit. During the initial inquiry, it was revealed by Madan Lama, that he is a Nepali citizen and the second person identified himself as HareshRawal and the applicant admitted that he had charas in his wallet and used to sell the same to his customers. HareshRawal acknowledged that he had come to buy charas and that he had transferred Rs.9, 500 / – to the applicant and the applicant handed over the package containing charas. And then the petitioner applied for bail.RULES APPLICABLE:Special Powers of High court or Court of Session regarding bail- Section 439 of the code states that any orders passed under section 436 of the code shall be appealable.Section 8 deals with the prohibition of certain activities.No one –With an exception that the medical or Scientific purposes in the manner and extent provided for by the provisions of this Act or the laws or regulations made under it.Section 20 (b) of the NDPS Act states that if a person manufactures, owns, sells, buys, distributes, imports, exports or uses cannabis and the amount involved is less than the maximum commercial but greater than the minimum amount, then the person will be punished with severe imprisonment for a period of up to ten years and a fine of up to one lakh rupees.Any person who consents to, or participates in, a criminal offense, is liable to punishment under this Chapter, whether or not the offense is committed as a result of this delay or in the case of such criminal conspiracy, and in addition to anything contained in section 116 of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860), may be punished by the penalty imposed on the case.A person is acting in or is part of, a criminal conspiracy to commit, in terms of this section, an Indian, who is acting in or participating in a criminal conspiracy to commit any act outside the territory of or outside India-(a) Maybe an offense if committed within India; or(b) Under local laws, is a drug-related or psychotropic drug that has all the legal requirements required to make that case the same or similar to the legal requirements required to make it a criminal offense under this Chapter, if committed within India.COURT’S RULINGS AND OBSERVATIONS:The petitioner has no roots in society because he is a Nepali citizen and can be considereda potential flight hazard.

    "data": "This Article is Written RASHI SHARMA, 3rd YEAR student, SCHOOL OF LAW, AJEENKYA D.Y PATIL UNIVERSITY, PUNEINTRODUCTIONThe Hindu code bills were a few laws passed during the 1950s that planned to classify and change Hindu individual law in India. Following India’s freedom in 1947, the Indian National Congress government drove by Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru with the assistance of Dr. B. R. Ambedkar finished this codification and change, and interaction began by the British Raj. As indicated by the British approach of non-obstruction, individual law change ought to have emerged from interest from the Hindu people group. The Hindu code bills were few laws passed during the 1950s that intended to systematize and change Hindu individual law in India. There was huge resistance from different moderate Hindu government officials, associations, and lovers; they saw themselves unjustifiably singled out as the sole strict local area whose laws were to be improved. Nonetheless, the Nehru organization considered such to be as important to bind together the Hindu people group, which is a perfect world, would be an initial move towards bringing together the country. They prevailed with regards to passing four Hindu code bills in 1955–56: the Hindu Marriage Act, Hindu Succession Act, Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act, and Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act. They keep on being dubious to the current day among ladies, strict, and patriot gatherings.[i]HISTORYAs Derrett says in his book on Hindu law, “We view the Hindus to be as different in race, brain research, territory, work, and lifestyle as an assortment of people that may be assembled from the closures of the earth.” The Dharmaśāstra—the literary expert on the issue of marriage, reception, the joint family, minorities, progression, strict gifts, and position advantages—has frequently been viewed as the private law of the Hindus. In any case, whatever is known and deciphered about this Hindu law is a mix of rules, and frequently conflicting and inconsistent with each other, which is deficient inconsistency.Hindu law’s substance and construction have at last been made due because of its organization by British appointed authorities who concentrated on Hindu strict lawful writings, while at the same time conjuring English system, law, and English law to fill any holes. Suppositions frequently contrast with respect to the degree of the error between the current law and the public’s requirements, however, most concur that a considerable irregularity exists.In 1921, the British Government had effectively ventured to such an extreme as to invite singular Members’ endeavors at piecemeal codification, a restricted however huge change in arrangement. As indicated by Levy, that year, “two Hindu lawmakers, one a legal advisor in the Central Legislative Assembly (the lower house), the other a prominent researcher of Sanskrit in the Central Council of States (the upper House), started goals looking for Government support for a Hindu Code of family law.” In the following twenty years, numerous fragmentary measures were instituted, altering the Hindu law of marriage, legacy, and joint family property. Overall, the authorized bills conveyed further an unobtrusive pattern toward expanding property alienability, lessening the legitimate significance of standing, endorsing strict heterodoxy and transformation, and, most essentially, advancing the situation of ladies. Nonetheless, it was the death of the Hindu Women’s Rights to Property Act (Deshmukh Act) in 1937, which had given the widow a child’s offer in the property that was perhaps the most generous strides towards the Hindu Code Bill.[ii]PURPOSE SUPPORT & OPPOSITIONDuring the discussions over the Hindu code bills in the General Assembly, enormous sections of the Hindu populace dissented and held assemblies against the bills. Various associations were framed to campaign for the loss of the bills and enormous measures of writing were dispersed all through the Hindu populace. Even with such vocal resistance, Nehru needed to legitimize the entry of the Hindu code bills. Prior, he had expressed that as per the arrangement of non-obstruction, he was embraced codification in consistence with an interest from the Hindu people group. At the point when obviously by far most of Hindus didn’t uphold the Bills, he demanded that however they were a minority, the individuals who upheld the Bills were current and reformist thus held imperative load in the Hindu people group, in significance if not in numbers. He likewise contended that because the bill’s allies were reformists, the individuals who contradicted would ultimately change their position when faced with the real factors of innovation.Advocates included all kinds of people inside and outside of Parliament having a place with different ideological groups. Critical help for the bills came from Congress’ ladies’ wing (All-India Women’s Conference) and a few other ladies’ associations. Allies generally looked to persuade the public that the bills didn’t wander a long way from traditional Hindu individual law. Basically, those in Parliament who went against the bills were men, to a great extent from Nehru’s own Congress party. They accepted that the code bills would establish change that wandered excessively far from the traditional Hindu social request and was excessively extremist. They contended that practices, for example, separate were by no means supported by Hinduism. “To a Hindu, the marriage is sacred and as such constant. “They additionally felt that should rise to property rights be given to ladies, the Mitākṣarā idea of a joint family would disintegrate, as would the establishment of Hindu society. They additionally demanded that if girls and spouses were given a legacy, more struggles would emerge inside families. Their principal contention, nonetheless, was that the bills needed public help. Consequently, they were an immediate inconsistency to the strategy of non-impedance and would mean the government was intruding in close-to-home law. They suggested that these were bills engendered by a little minority of Hindus onto the greater part who didn’t need them.[iv] CURRENT SCENARIOThe use of the Hindu Code Bills has been dubious in figuring out who is to be known as a Hindu and who is qualified to be absolved from specific principles of Hindu law. They are additionally still argumentative among numerous networks, including ladies, patriots, and strict gatherings. At the hour of their creation, many depicted them as a genuine deviation from Hindu legitimate point of reference.Women’s activists, like Nivedita Menon, contend that since the individual laws cover matters of marriage, legacy, and guardianship of kids, and since all close to home laws oppress ladies, the strain inside the laws is a logical inconsistency between the privileges of ladies as individual residents and those of strict networks as aggregate units of the majority rules system. In her 1998 article “State, Gender, Community: Citizenship in Contemporary India”, she calls for more help and inception for change inside every close-to-home law and more enactment in regions that are not covered by common or individual laws, like aggressive behavior at home. She additionally contends for a sex equivalent structure of rights that covers “the general population” space of work (maternity benefits, equivalent wages) and is accessible to all Indian residents, subsequently keeping away from a head-to-head conflict with networks and mutual legislative issues.[v]This article is edited by Dhruv Kapoor, FIMT, affiliated to GGSIPU, Delhi[i]https://www.jstor.org/stable/2752804[ii]https://www.epw.in/system/files/pdf/1949_1/52/the_hindu_code_bill.pdf[iii]https://dalithistorymonth.medium.com/the-hindu-code-bill-babasaheb-ambedkar-and-his-contribution-to-womens-rights-in-india-82387c53758[iv]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_code_bills[v]https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindu_code_bills Nehru’s basic role in establishing the Hindu code bills was to bring together the Hindu people group. So, it appeared well and good to characterize Hinduism in the broadest conceivable sense. By lawful value, Nehru planned to “delete qualifications inside the Hindu people group and make Hindu social unity… The coordination of Hindus into a homogeneous society should best be possible by establishing a comprehensive code which envelops inside its crease each group, station, and strict category.”The discussions over Article 44 in the Constitution uncovered that many accepted shifted laws and lawful divisions made or possibly were intelligent of social divisions. Nehru and his allies demanded that the Hindu people group, which contained 80% of the Indian populace, first should have been joined before any moves were made to bring together the remainder of India. In this way, the codification of Hindu individual law turned into a representative start making a course for setting up the Indian public character. Nehru additionally felt that since he was Hindu, it was his right to arrange explicitly Hindu law, rather than Muslim or Jewish law.Those in Parliament who upheld the bills additionally considered them to be an indispensable move towards the modernization of Hindu society, as they would depict common laws from strict law. Many additionally proclaimed the bills’ chance to execute more noteworthy rights for ladies, which were set up to be vital, for India’s turn of events.[iii]"

    "headline": "False confession and the way of dealing with them in different countriesWHETHER SUPREME COURT CAN INTERFERE IN THE PERSONAL LAWS?NEET (UG)- 2019 Wrong Answer Key: SC agrees to hear the plea of  students.THE EVER-LOOMING DARKNESS OF LAW OF SEDITION",
    "data": "This article is written by S.Karpagam.Introduction:Confession primarily refers to the acceptance of any truth by the offender in such the simplest way that the same can be applied to him or her in criminal cases against him or her. If the confession of any wrongdoing is performed by an innocent person, it’s called a Confession of Lies. To better perceive the topic, lets first understand the meaning of the word “confession”. In criminal law, the word Confession is outlined as an individual who confesses to a crime. There aren’t any debts that constitute confession. Judge Sir Leslie Stephen explained for the first time during an outline of the evidence Act, “pleading guilty means an individual who could be accused of a crime confesses or interferes with the crime he or she has committed.” Consent is taken into account as a part of acceptance as a result of it’s outlined within the commission section. Sections 24 to 30 of the Indian Testimony Act embody confession of sins. Confession is a confession; however, each word is terribly totally different from each other. There are often several reasons why a person will incorrectly admit guilt. Common reasons include intimidation by investigating officers, the utilization of inappropriate strategies by the police during the investigation and much more. Defendants’ confession is often considered one of the foremost necessary pieces of evidence in relation to a criminal case and therefore, it’s necessary to make sure that such evidence remains free from all offenses.False confession:False confession occurs when a person admits guilt when he is not the perpetrator. The use of intimidation or coercion to obtain a statement may result in a false confession. They can also be the product of a defendant’s mental disability. Acceptance of falsehood may sound impossible, but it does happen all the time and can cause many problems during a criminal trial. False confession can occur when a person admits a crime in order to draw the attention of the court to the person who actually committed the crime. For example, a person may confess to a crime to save a friend, family member, or relative under investigation. False admission can be used to evade severe punishment, such as when a person admits a minor offense he did not commit. If the confession is found to be false, the judge will no doubt remove the same assertion from the record, and it will no longer be accepted in court. In addition, a person who makes a false confession may face additional fines for lying in court. This is known as lying.Types of false confession:There are many kinds of false confession. Here are the few of them:Voluntary confession:This confession is made on the basis of the confession of the confessor’s mind and conscience, or on the basis of some external pressure or coercion brought on the confessor, but not on any official / investigator in authority. Sometimes voluntary false confession is motivated by psychological problems, for example, a person may make a statement because of the great need for punishment or is unable to distinguish between reality and fantasy. A person may make a voluntary false confession to protect and defend the real suspect, to provide for the participation in a different crime or, to commit an act of retaliation against another person. Judges and lawyers often have little faith in these types of confessions.In one case in the United States, “John Mark Karr pleaded guilty to the murder of six-year-old JonBenét Ramsey. Karr was deeply concerned about every aspect of his murder, and was deported to Thailand on the basis of his confession of sins ten years after his death. However, his account contradicts the specification of the case, and his DNA was not the same as that found on the scene. His wife and brother said he was at home in another state at the time of the murder and had never visited Colorado. Prosecutors have never charged him with this crime because his confession was false. ”Persuaded false Confession:Investigating techniques can cause a person to question his or her memory, leading him or her to believe that he or she has committed a crime that he or she did not commit. This is usually achieved in three stages:Complaint Confession:If officials use coercion, intimidation, or coercion, and the suspects strive to escape a harsh investigation, they may admit their guilt or not. Students can imagine that if they plead guilty, they will be released or run away from a harsh sentence. This is related to the enforcement error mentioned above. Confession is often easily postponed by confessors after the end of questioning. The interrogation in the prison area is excessive, disturbing, unpleasant and disturbing. The questioner’s conduct can be a source of frustration. His suspicious tactics are usually intended to create anxiety by undermining the suspect’s self-esteem, preventing him from seeking his innocence, and making him feel useless and trapped. Inquiries can last several hours, such as a false confession, weakening the suspect’s resistance, causing fatigue, and increasing aggression.Dealing of False confession in different countries:India:Various types are used by the court to deal with obtaining false confessions. The set of laws commonly used for this purpose is known as the law of confession. If a person is found to be giving false confession the following actions may be taken against them-Contempt of court :If such an unreasonable confession made by the accused causes or often causes disruption in the proceedings of the courts and leads to non-cooperation with the opposition party. The judge has absolute power to hold confession of sins.Criminal offenses can be suppressed:Any person who makes a false confession can be found guilty of additional crime depending on when and where the statement was made and to whom. A person who is guilty of a sin is liable toLying:“Lying is defined as the act of lying under oath. To lie means to lie in a court of law. The Indian Penal Code, 1860 defines the ‘fraud’ in Chapter IX of “false evidence and civil rights offenses” under Section 191. The penalty for perjury is defined under Section 193 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 as seven years’ imprisonment. ”Lying to the police:“Section 182 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860” – “False information, for the purpose of making a public servant use his or her legal powers to harm another person. Any person who provides any public service with any information that he or she knows or believes to be untrue, intends to create, or is likely to cause, is a public servant—To act or omit anything that such public servant should not do or leave if the actual facts about the information provided are known to him or her, orTo use the official power of a public servant to injure or offend any person shall be liable to imprisonment for any term of up to six months, or to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars, or to both. ”It could even lead to a hefty fine or even a prison sentence for obstruction of justice.Canada:In Canada the type of interrogation technique is known as the ‘Reid Technique’ named after John Reid, a former Chicago police officer. This approach involves three stages – factual analysis, discussion and interrogation. At first the suspects were simply seen knowing the signs of lying or telling the truth. In the event that the interviewee at any time discovers that the suspect is lying, the interrogation is conducted in the manner in which they think he or she is guilty, this may include the disruption of any denial made by the suspect and refusal to believe his or her account. The interrogator may use false statements or make false statements, may falsely claim that the suspect failed to check the fake detector or that his DNA was found at the scene, for example. For fear of being caught, the judge may consider consent as the best option. The investigative standards for the interviews of suspects and witnesses were revised in the 2011 Report’s Recommendations. This report focuses on following three points-In addition to the above recommendations various Canadian cities have their own ideas regarding video recording of conversations. As there is no law in Canada that requires recording a video during an interview of the suspects. One of the leading cases in this regard was R v Sinclair.United States of America:False confession is no longer the same as in any other country. Their business covers the whole world, including the United States. In countries like the United States, leadership technology is used to interview suspects. Saul Kassin, a psychologist at the John Jay Criminal Justice School in New York, is one of the world’s foremost experts in questioning and has played a key role in defining the concept of false confession and brought in a number of prosecutors. Police opened their eyes and asked new questions and signs of investigation. This was first found in the case of Huwe Burton, who spent 20 years on parole after a thorough police investigation. The lawyer made every effort to prove his innocence after his transfer to prison, but attorney Burton asked Dr. Carson to explain the meaning of this false confession without the need for support. Burton’s 30-year sentence. This mistaken notion of confession was considered in the United States.Brazil:One of the most widely accepted practices in Brazil is police brutality against suspects who may be poor or criminal suspects. Police brutality can be seen in that. The suspects turned to so much mistreatment and insanity that false confession was their way out of self-defence.China:In countries like China, the chances of false confessions are increasing due to the prolonged detention of suspects and the use of highly mandatory investigative techniques. However, the best step the world has taken is video chat.Australia, Denmark, New Zealand, Sweden, Norway:One common denominator among all these countries is that in order to avoid false confessions they have resorted to ‘interview with investigators’ which aims to gather more information from the accused instead of confessing sins without resorting to counterfeit and coercive methods.Conclusion:Punishment should not be for retaliation, but for reducing crime and converting criminals. The worst crime a person can commit is to impose on an innocent person something that will cause him or her to pay damages. Investigators, officers, detectives while identifying and arranging innocent people themselves also fell into the abyss of filth and negligence. The real criminal still lies in the open, committing his crimes, while the weak, morally upright person and the righteous one die in prison, both literally and figuratively. In the global context, it seems that developed countries have well-established legal frameworks and guidelines for preventing false positives, but much remains to be done in the case of developing or developed countries.Citation:This article has been edited by Anamika Singh.Voluntary false confessionPersuaded false confessionComplaint false confessionThe investigator uses lengthy, tense, and punitive questions to make the defendant doubt his or her innocence.Investigators give the defendant reasons for the case and how it may have been committed without his or her recollection. Excessive personality, blackout, post-traumatic stress disorder, or compressed memory can all be suggested as reasons for human behaviour.After pleading guilty to any wrongdoing, the perpetrator may give false evidence to support the crime because he or she sincerely believes that he or she did it.Conversations conducted under police control should be videotaped especially if the suspects are involved in serious cases of violence and not only the final statement should be in writing but the whole conversation.The criteria for investigation should also be that they increase the credibility of the outcome of the investigation process.Appropriate strategies should be used in the negotiation process and should also be investigated as to why some people admit to crimes they did not commit.[Aniket Vashisth], [False confessions and the way of dealing with them in different countries], [lawtimesjournal], [2020][Wikipedia], [False confession], [Wikipedia], [2021][Amelia Hritz, Michal Blau, and Sara Tomezsko], [False confession], [cornel.edu]"

    "headline": "‘Every Indian Has To Use His Liberties To Constantly Question The Actions Of Those In Power’ By Justice Ravindra Bhat.Marital Rape under Indian LawThe History Of Sedition And Its Relevance In Today’s worldHow Effective Are Tribal Laws in India?",
    "data": "This article is written by Eugenia Enyonam Datsomor.IntroductionLiberty is the state of being free in society from oppressive4 restrictions imposed by authority on one’s way of life, behavior, or political views. Liberty is being independent and having freedom. It is also the right to a privilege.Article 21 of the Indian Constitution is a fundamental right that declares that no person shall be deprived of his or her life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law. This is to say that even the constitution allows liberty to citizens.According to Justice RavindraBhat, we gained our freedom at a great cost. Every Indian, therefore, has to use his liberties to constantly question the actions of those in power because democracy gives no tickets to free meals. It is for us to assert and guard liberty and not be complacent about any encroachment. ‘Connecting Governed, Governing and Governance (G3)’ was the theme during the first anniversary celebrations of the forum and the topic being spoken about was ‘Role of Judiciary in Governance’Key things mentionedThat is the judgment made by the nine judges in Indira Sawhney in 1992 which mentioned the use of it, ‘as an elaborate discourse on the need to balance the right to equality with the aspirations of those who are in the most marginalized sections of the society and for whom the rule of reservation was brought in’. This is to say that till date not every society or group of people is equal in terms of literacy, finances, and many others. Due to this, the rule of reservation seeks to be of aid to such people who deserve it in society. Per Justice, he stated that ‘Reservation, at leastwithregard to scheduled tribes and most backward classes, is essential and we cannot put a time-limit on it. Speaking personally, I would say it is not possible that we should do away with it as long as society is unequal and people are socially and emotionally backward! So long as the society is unwilling to castoff the shackles of caste, these quotas are needed because they underline empowerment!’.Writer’s OpinionThe judiciary is a very important aspect of every country as the judiciary performs a very key role of upholding as well as interpreting the law. Democracy as we practice will not be complete without the judiciary. However, it will also not be complete if the people do not question certain things done in the country. It is therefore the responsibility of each citizen to add up to the progress of the country by doing what they can to ensure peace and that the right thing is done. A democratic and developed country cannot be attained through just an individual but rather can be achieved when everyone puts in an effort to make it work. This article is edited by DhruvKapoor, FIMT, affiliated to GGSIPU.Justice Ravindra added that ‘Today, when the world is reeling under the impact of the Covid Pandemic, with painful and traumatic consequences disrupting lives and livelihoods, leaving behind despair, destruction and impoverishment, it is more important for people to cherish liberties and constantly question, through every legitimate channel, the moves and policies which undermine the democratic government and displace the liberties that the constitution guarantees.He further noted that democracy cannot be a hundred percent guidance to the country since it has its own imperfections but rather the involvement of the people by questioning what goes on will also go a long way to help the country. He conveyed this through the statement he made that, ‘Those nations who reposed their trust in a democratic way of governance must be prepared for imperfections. But its people have to exercise their freedom to question those governing them unremittingly and unfailingly, and through this dialogue, realize their aspirations. It may be a fundamental right, right to get your ration card or to change your date of birth, if you don’t get justice internally you have to go to the court- there is no other way. The rule of law through democracy is a continuing work in progress where people’s scrutiny is paramount andcourts are part of the dialogue. There is a thin line that divides the rule of law from the rule by law-one is democracy and the rulers are the people, and the second one is ruled by a monarchy, a dictator, or tyrant. The courts are the last stop to ensure continuity of the rule of law when all else fails!’.Justice also said that the ability of citizens to talk and question what goes on does not only protect other people but themselves as well.He also mentioned that the courts are supposed to play a very significant role in government which is why the constitutional framers gave the court the advisory role in matters on the validity of the laws and policies which the Parliament or executive wish to bring forward. He added that courts face the charge of activism when they deal with controversial issues and he opined that in this context one must remember that the courts are placed in a system of checks and balances and that characterizing courts or judges as ‘activist’, ‘strict constructionist’ or ‘conservationist is limiting.Justice also commended the Supreme Court for their ability to speak multiple times with regard to several issues. He said that ‘These are very important on governance because unless you know what you can speak and what you cannot speak, it is very easy for the state to criminalize any content.Another aspect he touched on was the issue of reservation –He also praised the Election Commission for being an arbiter of free and fair elections as they played a vital role in maintaining peace and fairness during elections. As compared to the rigging elections years back.He also highlighted some precedents that were well-handled by the court as he said that precedents form a very important part of judging current issues. Thus, the judicial interventions when there were gaps of policies with no laws. He gave an example as the Vishaka case was through these guidelines for the prevention of sexual harassment at the workplace were laid down. He also gave other examples such as LaxmikantPandey’s case, and many others.Justice concludes by mentioning that the court performs a gatekeeping function and has the responsibility to value and uphold the constitution and other laws of India. He as well mentioned that he is proud to be hailing from Kasaragod and Kerala."

    "headline": "Domestic Violence Cannot Be Used as a Ploy by Son to Claim Father’s Property On The Strength Of Wife’s Right of Residence: Delhi HCSupreme Court Judge in TroubleDOES CONCEPTION OF PREGNANCY POST TUBECTOMY COME UNDER THE ACT OF MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE?ENFORCEABILITY OF DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICY",
    "data": "This article is written by Eugenia EnyonamDatsomor.IntroductionDomestic violence refers to an abuse in a domestic home such as marriage or cohabitation. Thus, it is committed by someone in the victim’s domestic circle. This includes partners, ex-partners, immediate family members, other relatives and family friends. It can be in the form of physical, sexual or psychological abuse.Recently, a case was brought before the court where the son wanted to take possession of the father’s property on grounds of domestic violence. Subsequently, the father filed a suit against his son and daughter-in-law seeking a decree of Permanent injunction against them thereby restraining them from disposingof the suit property.Per the Court“While the DV Act is social welfare legislation granting protection to women who are victims of domestic violence, every dispute amongst family members cannot be converted into a dispute under the DV Act. The same ought not to be allowed to happen, as it may cause unintended misuse of the provision of the said Act creating turmoil within families, especially when there is no matrimonial dispute whatsoever between husband and the wife, that is son and daughter in law, the court observed at the outset.Subsequently, the appeal was dismissed by the court, and it was made known that the holdings of the trial court and the first appellate court need no intrusion.Writer’s opinionIt can be observed that based on this current judgement by the court on this case that a child cannot possess the property of the parent on basis of domestic violence. Actions such as these taken will be considered void. Thus, this present case law backs the new principle which has been stated. This article is edited by Dhruv Kapoor, FIMT, affiliated to GGSIPU.It was held on Tuesday by the Delhi High Court, that the provision of Domestic violence could not be used as a ploy by a son for his father’s residence and that of his wife.Justice Pratibha Sing observed thus,the provisions of the DV Act cannot be used as a ploy by the son, to either claim a right in his father’s property or continue to retain possession of the father’s property on the strength of his wife’s right of residence.A civil dispute relating to ownership of property cannot be converted, in this manner, into a case under the DV Act, as the same would amount to be an abuse of the beneficial provisions of the DV Act, by stretching it over and beyond its purpose and ambit”.A suit seeking a decree of a permanent injunction by the father was filed against his son and daughter in law thus impeding them from casting off the suit property. He held that being the owner of the property, a permanent injunction was needed because of constant arguments between the defendant’s being his son and daughter in law.The defendant’s also held that the said property was obtained from a joint family fund and retrieved from the former property to which he was a stakeholder under the application Order 12 Rule 6 of CPC.A decree was passed by the trial court in favour of the plaintiff and it was made known that the defendants were merely licensees. It was confirmed by the first appellate court. This was further challenged by way of a second appeal in court by the defendant.Evaluating the case and relying on a plethora of judgement on the issue, it was held by the court that the father was not in a financially stable condition and needed legal aid to be able to follow through before the trial court to which it was further stated “These pleas are much generalised, and appear to be pleas which are taken to highlight the domestic problem within the family members rather than to set up a case under the DV Act. Admittedly, there are no complaints that have been preferred against the father in law and therefore no case filed or pending under the DV Act, or any other legislation at the instance of the daughter in law, the court observed.”At a later date, it was made notice that allegations levelled against the brother/ dear in the written document, would not lead to a shared household, where the right of residence would have to be obtained by the daughter in law."

    "headline": "Can A Non-Member of  A State Legislature Be Elected As A Minister Or Chief Minister?PLAY THE DEVIL’S ADVOCATE: CAREER IN CORPORATE LAWFIRs TO BE UPLOADED WITHIN 24 HOURS: SUPREME COURTLawyers response to the BCI resolution over CAA",
    "data": "This article is written by Aditi Bhushan from KIIT School of Law A unique event happened in the election of 2021 to the Legislative Assembly of West Bengal which was conducted between from 27th of March to 29th of April for 292 constituencies when a number of parties participated however the main focus was on the tussle between Mamata Banerjee led All India Trinamool Congress and Modi- Shah led BJP. The result which came out put the citizens in an ethical dilemma. Out of 292 constituencies AITC secured 219 constituencies, however the party president Mamata Banerjee lost from her constituency i.e Nandigram to Suvendu Adhikari of the BJP and could not become MLA. This situation led to multiple questions: Whether Mamata Banerjee will be sworn in as the Chief Minister or not? Does a non-member of the legislative assembly be appointed as CM? If yes then what is the time period for a non-member of the Legislature to be permitted to become the Chief Minister? Is it true that appointing a Chief Minister who is not a member of the House will not be contrary to democratic ideals and the national interest? Whether a non-member who fails be elected during the six-month term following his or her appointment as a Minister?Answering the very first of whether Mamata Banerjee can be sworn as CM is YES. Even after losing from her constituency and not being a MLA, she can be appointed as CM under article 164(4) of Indian Constitution. Article 164 (4) of the Indian Constitution states that a Minister who is not a member of the State Legislature for six consecutive months’ ceases to be a Minister at the end of that period. This clause [originally taken from Section 10 (2) of the Government of India Act, 1935] states that no one who is not a member of the legislature is barred from becoming a minister. The corresponding provision for the Union is contained in Article 75(5) of the Indian Constitution. And as mentioned in the Article 164(4) if the person within 6 months fails to be elected again then he ceases to be minister.The scope and ambit of Article 164 (4) of the Indian Constitution have already been considered by the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India in a series of decisions. The Hon’ble Supreme Court’s Constitution Bench in [Har Sharan Verma Vs. Shri Tribhuvan Narain Singh, Chief Minister, U.P. & Anr., 1971(1) SCC 616] dealt with a similar subject in depth. The Bench addressed whether a person who is not a member of the State Legislature can be nominated as Chief Minister. The nomination of Tribhuvan Narain Singh as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh was challenged in the aforementioned case on the grounds that he was not a member of either House of Legislature at the time of his appointment.In Har Sharan Verma v. Tribhuvan Narain Singh, the appellant challenged the respondent’s appointment as Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh on October 18, 1970, notwithstanding the fact that he was not a member of the legislature at the time of his appointment. The Allahabad High Court dismissed the challenge, ruling that a Chief Minister, like any other Minister, can retain office for six months without being a member of the Legislature. The High Court denied the quo warranto writ filed under Article 226 of the Constitution but issued the certificate under Article 132 of the Constitution. For the first time, a five-judge Supreme Court Constitution Bench read Article 164(4). On behalf of the appellant, it was argued that Article 164(4) applied exclusively to a person who was once a Minister but is no longer a Minister for any reason. Such a person may serve for a period of six months, although an initial appointment of a non-Member of a State legislature is not permitted.In the matter of Ashok Pandey Vs. Km Mayawati, AIR 2007 SC 2259, the Supreme Court reiterated that a person who is not a member of the Legislative Assembly or Legislative Council can be appointed as Chief Minister or Minister. It should be emphasised, however, that the length of six months implies that the time must run continuously and not even occasionally.Another issue was if a non-member who fails to be elected to the Legislature after being appointed as a Minister for six consecutive months, or when a Minister has ceased to be a Legislator, be reappointed as a Minister without being elected to the Legislature after the six-month term has expired?In S. R. Chaudhuri Vs State Of Punjab, (2001) 7 SCC 126 The Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to allow an individual who is not a member of the Legislature to be appointed as a Minister for a period of six months without first being elected. The approach would certainly be in violation of the constitutional structure, as well as improper, undemocratic, and illegitimate. Article 164 (4) is, at most, a one-time exception to the regular rule of only members of the Legislature serving as Ministers, limited to a term of six consecutive months.Similar cases in pastThis is not the first time in the recent past that a sitting CM has lost the election and the party has gone on to form the government.Yogi Adityanath, for example, was not an MLA when he became Uttar Pradesh Chief Minister in 2017; he was elected an MLC within six months. Within six months, both of his deputies — Dinesh Sharma and Keshav Prasad Maurya — were elected MLCs with him.Similar circumstances arose in Jharkhand in 2009, when CM Shibu Soren was defeated in a by-election – perhaps the second occasion an incumbent CM was defeated in a by-election.In 2017, Goa Chief Minister Laxmikant Parsekar lost his Mandrem seat, but the BJP went on to establish the government with the aid of regional parties such as the Goa Forward Party and the Maharashtrawadi Gomantak Party, as well as some Independent MLAs. However, the BJP did not appoint Parsekar as chief minister; instead, it dispatched then-Defense Minister, late Manohar Parikkar, to take over in Goa.Tribhuvan Narayan Singh, the then-CM of Uttar Pradesh, had to retire after losing a by-election in 1970. However, Soren’s defeat culminated in the imposition of President’s Rule in Jharkhand.As a result, the constitutional stance on the nomination of Ministers, including the Chief Minister, is clear: a non-member of the Legislature can be appointed as Minister/Chief Minister, but only for a continuous term of six months. A non-member must become a member of the House within six months. There have been situations where a non-legislator has been appointed as Chief Minister. This occurred in the cases of Shri C. Rajagopalachari, who was appointed Chief Minister of Madras in 1952, and Shri Anajiah, who was appointed Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh in 1980.These precedents illustrate that there is no prohibition to appointing a person who is not a member of the Legislature to the position of Chief Minister of the State. Though, technically and legally, there is no distinction between a non-member (who did not participate in the election at all) and a non-member (who contested and lost the election), the question still remains whether it is ethical or moral to appoint a person who lost the election as Chief Minister?Citations:This Article has been edited by Anamika SinghAneesh Raj &amp; Tanya Biswas, Can A Non-Member Of A State Legislature Be Elected As A Minister Or Chief Minister?, LiveLaw(18 July 2021 5:01 PM), https://www.livelaw.in/columns/chief-minister-parliamentary-system-representation-of-people-act-1951-177703Dinesh Singh Chauhan, Can A Person Who Lost Election Be Appointed As Chief Minister?, Legal Service India E-journal, https://www.legalserviceindia.com/legal/article- 6121-can-a-person-who-lost-election-be-appointed-as-chief-minister-.htmlPawan Reley, Constitutional Validity of the Appointment of Non-Member of the Legislature as Chief Minister: A Critical Analysis in Light of the West Bengal Elections, 2021, Legit Eye(May 5, 2021), https://www.legalserviceindia.com/legal/article-6121-can-a-person-who-lost-election-be-appointed-as-chief-minister-.html"

    "data": "This article is written by – A.SivaSangari, from, VIT ChennaiCase: State Of U.P.Thru.Prin.Secy. Home &Ors.FACTS OF THE CASE:This case has relied upon two writ petitions. By way of the first writ petition, the applicant attacked the Circular 26.10.2020 issued by the Director-General of Police, U.P., Lucknow from which guidelines have been issued for the dignity of wearing a proper uniform and appropriate appearance for a member of the disciplined forces. The applicant also attacked the suspension letter dated 05.11.2020 passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police / Superintendent Chief of Police, Ayodhya (Faizabad) where the applicant has been placed under suspension in consideration of the department’s investigation because despite the applicant being a member of the disciplinary body, he keeps his beard and even after receiving the notification from the higher officials, he didn’t shave his beard. The applicant also attacked the order dated 13.11.2020 passed by the Deputy Inspector General of Police / Chief Superintendent of Police, Ayodhya (Faizabad) whereby he declined the application which was given by the applicant dated 03.11.2020 where the applicant sought permission to keep his beard as per Islamic religious beliefs. While with the Second writ petition, the applicant attacked the indictment dated 29.07.2021 issued by the Superintendent of Police (Rural Area), Ayodhya (Faizabad) contained as Annexure No.04 in the application for the document. As the facts of both cases are common, therefore, both of these cases are taken by common decision/order.ISSUES BEFORE COURT:Whether non-shaving of the beard by a disciplinary body protected under art 25 and 26 of the constitution?RULES APPLICABLE:Article 25 of the Constitution guarantees freedom of religion for all Indians. It provides that all Indians, by social order, morality, health, and other provisions:Article 26 (subject to public order, morality, and health) provides the right to any religious system or to any part of that religion: COURT’S OBSERVATIONS:Initially, the Court recognized that this being a domain of a competent authority to issue guidelines regarding the wearing of appropriate uniforms and to maintain the proper appearance of members of the armed forces so “No disruption should be made, as, maintaining and wearing appropriate uniforms and maintaining body appearance and it is one of the first and most important requirements for trained members of the armed forces,” the Court added. Accordingly, the Court further noted that his application was rejected in terms of the DGP Circular, and therefore, the Court did not find any weakness or illegality in this order (he denied his request to keep his beard in accordance with the beliefs.)Coming to the inquiry aspect the court said that compliance with the law, adherence to the principles of natural justice with expedition likely within a period of three months. Now, about the showcase notice given to the applicant/police officer Farman, it was argued by him that the act of not having his beard even after the direction of a high-ranking official does not lead to misconduct. His attorney, therefore, said that the indictment should not have been issued to investigate the department. In this regard, the Court, in the first instance, ruled: “The member of the armed forces must strictly follow the higher orders or circulars or orders issued by the department or departmental authority as such as their executive orders. And there was infirmity in the said impugned charge sheet which is issued against Constable Farman, the Court found this: Even after making awareness about the non-shaving of beard by the in charge at Khandasa police station, the applicant hasn’t sheared his beard and it is not only violation of the guidelines issued by senior officials but also indicating the disrespect, incompetence and rebelliousness of the applicant. “Importantly, referring to Mohammed Zubair Corporal No. 781467-G vs. Union of India[i] an important factor that was set before the Supreme Court was to convince the so-called Muslim police officers not to shave their beards or hair”. As a result, noting that the allegations made in the paper, the prima facie, committed misconduct in accordance with the findings of the Inquiry Officer, the Court dismissed the anonymous court application.JUDGEMENT:By looking at the facts, reasons, and rules of the cases identified by the right parties, the court did not find any weakness or illegality in the opposition charging document dated 29.07.2021 issued against the applicant by SeniorPolice Chief, Ayodhya / Faizabad. The court also has a view that the departmental inquiry against the petitioner should be conducted and concluded to its logical end. The Hon’ble High Court ruling states: -Upendra Singh case[ii]may not redeem the applicant, as the allegations in the paper, the prima facie, show misconductdepending on the specific findings of the Investigating Officer. Therefore, in this case, the court dismisses the petition and instructed the Investigator to conduct and complete the intended investigation for the petitioner.STATED CASES:It was held that the regulations with regard to personal appearances are not intended to discriminate the feelings which were protected under Art 25 and Art 26 of the constitution.Keeping a beard by a police officer who is professing Islamic religion will not be saved by Art 25 and Art 26 of the Indian constitution and that is not their essential religious practice.It that even if any student or set of students does or do not sings National Anthem in school prayer due to their religious belief, even such right is protected under Article 25 of the Constitution of India.It is the duty of every official to respect the showcase orders which is passed by the higher authorities.It stated that the Charge sheet or show cause notice in disciplinary proceedings will not be simply quashed by the court.This article is edited by Dhruv Kapoor, FIMT, affiliated to GGSIPU[i] (2017) 2 SCC 115[ii]1994 SCC (3) 357[iii] (2017) 2 SCC 115[iv] W.P NO 8916 of 2012[v] (1986) 3 SCC 615[vi] AIR 1987 SC 943[vii]CIVIL APPEAL NO. 2333 OF 2007ART 25-FREEDOM OF RELIGIONThey have an equal right to freedom of conscience and they have the right to profess, practice, and propagate the religion.It further states that this article will not affect any existing law and will not prevent the state from enacting any law relating to:Control or prohibition of any economic, financial, political, or other secular activity associated with religious practice.Provide social welfare and transformation.The opening of Hindu religious institutions of public character for all classes and stages of Hinduism.ART 26-FREEDOM TO MANAGE RELIGIOUS AFFAIRSEstablish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes;Managing its affairs concerning religion;Possession of goods (movement and motion);Managing property under the law.Mohammed Zubair Corporal No. 781467-G vs. Union of India and others[iii]ZahiroddinShamsoddinBedade vs. State of Maharashtra and others[iv]Bijoe Emmanuel and others vs. State of Kerala and others[v]The State of U.P. vs. ShriBrahmDatt Sharma and another[vi]Secretary, Ministry of Defence and others vs. Prabhash Chandra Mirdha[vii]"

    "headline": "ABETMENT AND CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY – THE DIFFERENCEINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN INDIAAre Contractual Workers Entitled to Benefits under The Maternity Benefit Act?UTTARAKHAND HIGH COURT HAD ISSUED DIRECTIONS OF VICTIMS OF ACID ATTACKS",
    "data": "This article is written by RASHI SHARMA, 3rd YEAR student, SCHOOL OF LAW, AJEENKYA D.Y PATIL UNIVERSITY.INTRODUCTIONThe very definition and idea of crime fluctuate not just as indicated by the upsides of a specific gathering and society, its arrangements, confidence, strict perspectives, customs, customs, and restrictions yet in addition as per the type of government, political, the monetary construction of the general public and number of different components. For example, what is an offense against property in an entrepreneur society might be a legal method of living in a communist society.Indian Penal Code is a piece of complete enactment. The code exemplifies the overall corrective law of the nation and is the sole expert regarding the overall states of work, the meanings of the particular offenses in the Code, and the states of exclusions from criminal risk. A few crimes are cognizable, and some are not.[i]The term ‘abetment’ in criminal law shows that there is a differentiation between the individual abetting the commission of an offense (or abettor) and the genuine culprit of the offense or the primary offense or the main wrongdoer. Whosoever, either before or at the hour of the commission of a demonstration, does anything to work with the commission of that demonstration, and consequently work with the commission thereof, is said to help the doing of that demonstration.[ii]The IPC was changed in 1870 to embed Section120 An IPC. Part V-A has been presented in the code by the Criminal Law Amendment Act (8 of 1913). The object of the change was to forestall the commission of a crime by stopping them from ever really developing. As expressed over the consideration of Chapter V-An in the Penal Code was intended to absorb the arrangements of English law. This section was embedded in the Indian Penal Code in 1913. Conspiracy, at customary law, had its starting point fundamentally as a common wrong yet was subsequently made culpable as criminal wrong.[iii]ABETMENTIn the Indian Penal Code, Abetment is defined under section 107 as:[iv]Abetment of a thing – A person abets the doing of a thing, who: –a) Instigates any person to do that thing; orb) Engages with one or more other person or persons in any conspiracy for the doing ofthat thing if an act or illegal omission takes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, andto the doing of that thing; orc) Intentionally aids, by any act or illegal omission, the doing of that thing.Comprehensively under the Indian Penal Code, abetment can be defined as a person becomesliable as an abettor if he instigates another to commit a crime or engages in a conspiracy withanother to commit a crime and some act is done in furtherance of such conspiracy or if heintentionally aids another in order to facilitate the commission of a crime. The term ‘abet’ ingeneral usage means to assist, advance, aid, conduce, help and promote. The word ‘abet’ hasbeen defined as meaning to aid; to assist or to give aid; to command, to procure, or to counsel;to countenance; to encourage; induce, or assist, to encourage or to set another one to commit.[v]The term ‘abetment’ in criminal law indicates that there is a distinction between the personabetting the commission of an offence (or abettor) and the actual perpetrator of the offence orthe principal offence or the principal offender.An abettor is a person who abets an offence, who abets either the commission of an offence orthe commission of an act which would be an offence, if committed by a person capable by lawof committing an offence with the same intention or knowledge as that of the abettor. Theessentials are:(1) There must be an abettor;(2) He must abet, and(3) The abetment must be an offence or an act that would be an offence, if committedby a person capable in law of committing the offence with the same intention orknowledge as that of the abettor.[vi]CRIMINAL CONSPIRACYIn Mulcahy v. R.[vii]the House of Lords stated, “A conspiracy comprises not just in the goal of at least two however in the understanding of at least two to do an unlawful demonstration by unlawful means. Insofar as such a plan rests in expectation just it is just indictable. At the point when two consent to convey it into impact, the very plot is a demonstration in itself and the demonstration of every one of the gatherings guarantee against guarantee actus contra actum fit for being authorized if legitimate, culpable if for a criminal article or the utilization of criminal means.”Conspiracy under the Indian Penal Code originally was punishable only in two forms, viz., (i)conspiracy by way of abetment and(ii) conspiracy involved in a certain offence.In the formeran act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of conspiracy in order to be punishablewhile in the latter membership suffices to establish the charge of conspiracy.Thus the Indian Penal Code deals with the law relating to criminal conspiracy:The arrangements of Sections 120 An and 120B IPC have acquired the law of conspiracy India in line with the English law by making the clear demonstration unessential when the conspiracy is to submit any culpable offense. The arrangements, in such a circumstance, don’t need that every single individual who is involved with the conspiracy should do some obvious demonstration towards the satisfaction of the object of conspiracy the fundamental fixings being an understanding between the schemers to perpetrate the crime and if these basics and prerequisites are set up, the demonstration would fall inside the catching of the arrangements contained in Section 120B.DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ABETMENT AND CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY Section 109 of the code is concerned distinctly with the discipline of abetments for which no express arrangement is made under the Penal Code. A charge under Section 109 ought to, thusly, be separated from everyone else with some other considerable offense submitted asa result of abetment. Be that as it may, the offense of criminal conspiracy is, then again, a free offense. It is made culpable under Section 120 В of the code for which a charge under Section 109 of the Code is superfluous and, to be sure, improper.CONCLUSIONUnder the Penal Code, an individual becomes at risk as an abettor on the off chance that he induces one more to perpetrate a crime or takes part in a conspiracy with one more to carry out a crime and some demonstration is done in the advancement of such conspiracy or on the other hand in the event that he purposefully helps one more to work with the commission of a crime. The term ‘abet’ overall utilization intends to help, advance, help, conduce, help and advance. The word ‘abet’ has been characterized as which means to help; to help or to offer guide; to order, to get, or to direct; to face; to energize; instigate, or help, to urge or to set another to submit.In this manner, conspiracy is an undeveloped crime and is culpable basically becausea consent to carry out a crime is a definitive demonstration, full of possible risks; yet to carry a consent to perpetuate a common wrong inside the scope of criminal conspiracy is to extend the reasoning of law to as far as possible. In its expansive reach, it very well may be made to do extraordinary malevolence.The crime rate in India has been significantly expanding from one year to another and the feelings rate hard become extremely low and that too the courts have been granting very union disciplines by utilizing them vide optional forces.There are more opportunities to get merciful discipline by the demonstrated guilty parties due to losing outline work of the assembly in fixing the discipline for a few offenses in the Code. There is a greater likelihood to apply the preferred cerebrum and individual assessment of the legal officials while adjusting the sentence to the guilty parties, because of the wide tact accessible in the present condemning law. So that, there are additional opportunities to escape the blame from the grasp of the law.

The parties to the agreement are called „Conspirators‟In the offence of abetment, a mere combination of persons or agreement between themis not enough but an act or illegal omission must take place in pursuance of theconspiracy and order to the doing of the thing conspired for, But in conspiracy, the mere agreement is enough, if the agreement is to commit anoffence.Abetment can be committed by one or more, whereas conspiracy can be committedbytwo or more.In abetment, sanction of competent authorities is not necessary to proceed againsttheabettors, who merely abetted to commit a crime.While in conspiracy, sanction of competent authorities is necessary to proceed againstthe conspirators who merely agreed to commit a crime.Abetment is a genus while conspiracy is species.Abetment per se is not a substantive offence whereas criminal conspiracy is asubstantive offence by itself and is punishable.Abetment may be committed in various methods/ways viz., instigation, conspiracy,intentional aid, etc., but conspiracy is one of the methods of abetment.Crime of Abetment is explained in Sections 107 to 120 of the code while Crime of Conspiracy is explained in Sections 120- A & 120-B of the Code."

    "data": "This article is written by Eugenia Enyonam DatsomorIntroductionAn individual’s mental health includes his or her emotional, psychological, and social well-being. It affects how we think, feel, and act and helps determine how we deal with stress, relate to others, and make choices[i].Domestic violence refers to abuse in a domestic setting or homes such as marriage or cohabitation. Thus, it is committed by someone in the victim’s domestic circle. This includes partners, ex-partners, immediate family members, other relatives, and family friends. It can be in the form of physical, sexual, or psychological abuse.A woman was recently granted permission under the Bombay High Court to undergo a legal termination of her pregnancy after it was discovered that she was continually abused by her husband. The Court in its decision noted that the woman had filed a complaint to the police on account of her abuse alongside lodginga complaint towards a competent magistrate under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005[ii]Per the courtIt was further noted by Justices Ujjal Bhuyan & Madhav J Jamdar that, the woman (petitioner) was taking steps to dissolve the marriage by divorce while the husband had made it clear that he would not share the burden of raising and caring for the child. The petitioner had no money of her own. It was held by the bench that due to the circumstances at hand, the continuance of the petitioner’s pregnancy would not only become burdensome and oppressive on her but could also cause a probable detriment to her mental health.The case before the court involved a petition presented under article 226 of the Indian Constitution seeking consent for medical termination of pregnancy because the pregnancy was adversely affecting the mental health of the petitioner on account of repeated acts of violence and abuse meted out to her by her husband. Advocate Aditi Saxena, appearing on the side of the petitioner relied on a medical report dated June 13th, 2021 which recorded assault dealt by her husband, causing trauma to her face and abdomen. At that time also, the petitioner indicated her willingness to undergo termination of her pregnancy which was by then in its seventh week.The advocate again relied on a medical report dated June 19th, 2021 of the same institution as the previous which also recorded the history of the plaintiff being subjected to numerous assaults by her husband as well as her clear indication to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy. Additionally, Advocate Saxena relied on the medical board’s report in which Dr. Bela Verma, professor and head of the department of pediatrics in her opinion had advised a medical termination of the pregnancy for the petitioner as its sustenance and subsequent childbirthwould result in jeopardy of petitioner’s mental health.The Court’s attention was drawn to Article 3(2) (b) (I) of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 which stated: “a pregnancy may be terminated if the continuance of the same would involve a risk of grave injury to the physical or mental health of the pregnant woman.”The same report of the medical board constituted by the Court was relied on by one AGP Uma Palsuledesai where it was presented that, the petitioner suffered mental distress as a result of marital discord. It was further contended that, the petitioner at present did not suffer from any mental health issues and that she was fit to raise and care for the child as no evidence presented otherwise on account of mental health. The board again stated that marital discord between husband and petitioner at present could be settled with some marital counseling as recommended. The AGP further argued that section 3 of the MTP act was construed too strictly.Advocate Purnima for respondent No. 2 concurred with the statements and submissions made by Advocate Palsuledesai. On a query, made by the court, she submitted that, though the MTP (Amendment) Act, 2021 had been published in the Indian gazette, it had not yet been notified to the central government and thus, had not come into force yet.The Court’s Findings:In light of the court, what was to be considered was whether the continuance of the pregnancy would result in a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman and while deciding the same, the immediate and foreseeable environment of the pregnant woman was to be taken note of.The petitioner was allowed to undergo medical termination of her pregnancy in Dr. R. N>, Cooper Hospital without any further ado. Writer’s opinionAnalyzing the situation carefully, it will be very reasonable to side with the decision of the court since keeping the baby can cause a lot of havoc to both the mother and baby. Due to this new case law, women who have similar issues in the future will be able to terminate the pregnancy knowing that they are understood by society and are not the first to go through such a situation.This article is edited by Dhruv Kapoor, FIMT, affiliated to GGSIPU.[i] www.mentalhealth.gov.com[ii] www.livelaw.inIt was noted by the High Court that, the definition of a ‘mentally ill person’ as pointed out in section2 (b) illustrated a person who needed treatment because of a mental disorder as aside mental retardation.Furthermore, as noted by the Bench, it was stated in subsection (3) that, in determining whether the continuance of a pregnancy would include such high risk of damage to health as stated in subsection 2, may be taken of the pregnant woman’s immediate/foreseeable environment.Hence, the Court of the view that, while examining the expression ‘mental health of a pregnant woman, it was also of necessity to take not of such woman’s present/immediate environment.World Health Organization (WHO) defined ‘mental health as a state of well-being where each individual can cope with the daily stress of life as well as realize his/her potential of his mental capacities and can make contributions towards his community, the bench noted.Taking note of the submission of the AGP on account of the strict interpretation of the provisions, the Court adverted to explanation 1 of section 3 of MTP Act as per which in the case where a pregnant woman was alleged to have been raped resulting in the consequent pregnancy, the anguish as caused by such shall be presumed to constitute a grave injury to the mental health of the pregnant woman.Further, in reliance on WHO’s reproductive right, it was found that reproductive rights also included the right of the woman to make decisions concerning reproduction free of discrimination and violence."

    "data": "This article is written by S. KarpagamIntroduction:India’s Chief Justice NV Ramana noted that to find the beliefs and religions of the people, the judiciary must make everyone, and the majority of vulnerable citizens living outside the justice system, feel confident that it was there for all. Introducing the latest software developed by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) which aims to provide assistance to the poor through free legal aid, Justice Ramana said, “For the longest time, weak people live without a justice system ”. “Threats to human rights and physical integrity are the highest in police stations,” he said in a statement issued by the National Legal Services Authority of India (NALSA). Police harassment and other police violence are still widespread problems in our society. According to information shared by the Minister of Home Affairs Nityanand Rai in Parliament last week, the official number of culprits arrested between 2017 and 2019 was 1,189 and among them 348 were killed by police. Many experts believe that this child abuse data is uncountable. According to the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC), 1,723 people have died in detention and in police custody throughout India in 2019 alone. “This includes 1606 deaths in custody and 117 deaths in police custody, which means an average of five deaths every day,” said the National Campaign Against Torture.Legal representation:Lack of legal representation at police stations is a serious threat to detention or detention. The first hours of detention or detention often determine what the case will be about the defendant, the CJI said. The chief justice was speaking during the release of the National Legal Services Authority application and opinion statements in Vigyan Bhawan.The CJI had a voice of advice for fellow judges.Chief Justice Ramana noted that if the judiciary wants to win the trust of the poor and vulnerable, it must ensure that those who are looked down upon are there for them. “If the judiciary wants to strengthen the faith of our citizens, we must make everyone feel confident that we are fighting for it. For too long, vulnerable people live outside the justice system, ” said the CJI. The long, expensive legal procedures followed by the courts prevent the poor and vulnerable. The biggest challenge for justice today is to overcome these obstacles, he said. “If we want to live as a law-abiding society, it is important that we close the gap in access to justice between the privileged and the most vulnerable. At all times in the future, we must remember that the realities of social and economic diversity that exist in our nation cannot be the cause of the denial of rights. The past should not determine our future … ”Digital divide:Chief Justice Ramana said the digital divide did not help the cause of easy access to justice. Rural and remote areas suffer from a lack of connectivity. “Getting justice in India is not just a matter of aspirations. We must work with the various spheres of government to make it a reality. ” The Chief Justice said he had written to the government about the urgent need to close the digital channel “seriously”. “Let us dream of a future based on the rule of law, a future in which equality is a reality. That is why the ‘Access to Justice’ project is a never-ending process, ”said CJI Ramana.Emphasizing the importance of legal aid that reaches the most disadvantaged in remote areas, the CJI said, “If we want to live as a law-abiding society, it is important for us to close the gap between access to justice and the most vulnerable and vulnerable. At all times in the future, we must remember that the realities of social and economic diversity that exist in our nation, cannot be the cause of the denial of rights “.Speaking at the event, NALSA executive committee chairman Justice UU Lalit said the council plans to actively use the Indian Postal Service’s extensive network to spread awareness about free legal aid to the poorest. He also said that to make the ‘justice for all’ campaign a success, NALSA is negotiating with law colleges and universities to force third- and fourth-year law students to register as legal volunteers to help those in need of legal aid at no cost from national and government legal aid services.CJI Ramana said that almost 75 years after the country gained independence, harassment and other police brutality still exist in our country. “Threats to human rights and physical integrity are the highest in police stations. Harassment and other police brutality are widespread problems in our society.” The CJI has appealed to all attorneys, especially senior lawmakers, to provide “a certain percentage of their working hours” to assist those in need of legal aid.Calling NALSA’s project “Access to Justice” a never-ending goal, the CJI said its biggest obstacles were long, costly and costly processes. As an institution, the biggest challenge before us is to overcome these barriers first … The problem of poor communication in rural and remote areas that adversely affects the delivery of justice was highlighted by all (senior HC judges working with them after taking office. Such as CJI). Most importantly, he said that I have already written to the government emphasizing the need to close the digital divide in importance.Conclusion:Apart from the promulgation and confirmation of the constitution (of rights), the absence of effective lawyers at police stations is a serious risk to incarcerated people. The decisions taken in the latter case will determine the defendant’s ability to defend himself. According to the latest reports even those with the right to third-party medical care, “he said, also suggested that NALSA should work hard to promote national security. He said that although the legal profession, which started 25 years ago, had gained new momentum, it still had to reach a large segment of the population. Ours is one of the largest legal aid programs in the world. However, it is an undeniable fact that there are significant barriers to accessing relevant legal information.Citations:[scroll staff], [Threat to human rights is highest in police stations: Chief Justice of India NV Ramana], [scroll], [2021][wire] [CJI N.V.

    "headline": "UP’s New Population Policy: Skepticism or True concernThe Indian Legal Legend: Fali S NarimanEx-CJI’s nomination as a member of the Rajya Sabha by the PresidentWill you be sued for creating up a fake Facebook account?",
    "data": " This article is written by Wyomesh Tripathi from Campus Law Centre.Uttar Pradesh is the biggest state in India in terms of population and recently, on World Population Day, the UP government unveiled a population control policy proposed policy for population control for this decade (from 2021 to 2030). After its announcement, it caused a huge uproar, sparring debates and arguments from the oppositions, communities, critics and media.Why is this policy?The current population of Uttar Pradesh is 220 million and with the current growth rate (total fertility rate) of 2.7[1] , if this is not checked, it would lead to outburst at a humongous rate and with devastating implications on the lifestyle of the people.As per the census 2011, the population of UP was approximately 200 million, which was huge for a state considering its area. There are several big economies like France, Germany, South Korea, and Japan who have less population than UP, but some of these not only have lesser population than UP but bigger economies than the whole of India. According to a data published in 2017 on Quartz.com, it is evidential that if UP were to be considered as a separate state from India, then it would stand at number 5 in terms of population but the HDI would be one of the worst of all the countries as considering various government and non-government reports, it is confirmed that more than 60million of residents fall below poverty line.In any nation the resources are limited, either natural or artificial. UP is struggling to provide quality life inclusive of good education, healthy and nutritious food, good way of living etc. This problem could only be solved through collective and collaborative efforts of citizens and the government, as the resources may be exhausted soon if the population growth sustains.As the resources are limited so as to improve better quality of life and to refrain from population blast, the UP government led by Yogi Adityanath has put an effort and in the process, to keep check on the fertility rate, proposed a draft bill for the decade of 2021-2030. The whole intention of the bill is to curb the unchecked fertility rate and bring it down to 1.9 by 2030.What is the policy?Bill itself states that ‘’A Bill to revitalize efforts and provide for measures to control, stabilize and provide welfare to the population of the State by implementation and promotion of two child norm and for matters connected therewith and incidental thereto”[2].Therefore, the preamble of the bill clearly states that the intention of this draft is to ensure utmost welfare of the citizens of state and to maximize utility and well being of the inhabitants, eventually for the better quality of life.The proposed law has an overriding effect on existing laws and it talks about incentivizing those government employees who adopt two-child policy and voluntarily sign for sterilization after the second child. It proposes that the employee will be awarded two increments, subsidy for house, soft loan, paternity or maternity leave for 12 months with full salary and also free health care facilities to the person and their spouse.The draft also refers to incentives provided to the public servants who opt for single-child and sterilization after it, the incentives include: 4 increments during the service, free health care, education, and preference to that single child for government service and also for admission in the institutions.Bill also talks about citizens apart from the government servants, the common citizen who adopts the two-child policy; they will also be incentivized by the government: providing soft loans, concession on utilities and maternity/paternity leave for 12 months. The citizens who adopt a single-child will get benefits like free health up to 20 years, scholarships (in case of girl child), free education up to graduate level and preference for the child in government jobs.Bill also includes provisions for the citizens under Below Poverty Line, like cash incentives for adopting single-child, for boys it’s Rs. 80,000 and for girl child it’s Rs. 100,000 from the government’s state population fund. The fund is constituted for all the purposes of this act. The failure in the Medical tubectomy and vasectomy (or sterilization), will be compensated by the government from this fund to the aggrieved ones. Also, the child born out of such medical negligence would not be considered as contravention to the act. It lucidly culls out the adoption and multiple children during second birth as an exception for this two-child norm.For the contraveners it provides certain sanctions like barring from government job, contesting local elections, promotions, government subsidies and other disincentives regarding government sponsored welfare schemes.This law will be prospective of one year of commencement of the act hence giving one year time for the couples who already have 2 children.Regarding the polygamous and polyandrous marriages, this law refers that total children from all marriage must not exceed from 2, otherwise the liability arises.Why so much ruckus?The whole purpose of the bill is to control the population outburst and there to maximize the benefits to the citizens. Prima facie, it seems very sound and reasonable. The rationale is also very reformative but the eyebrows have risen due to the timing of the bill and also the provision for only 2 children in the legal polygamous marriages like in Islam. The contention is that this government wants to polarize the Hindu vote and have intention to decrease the population growth of the Muslim citizens. Also, it is just announced when much debated talks about Uniform civil code is going on hence as per the critics, it sends a deterrent and clear cut message to all but the government is denying this contention.CM Yogi Adiyanath, in his statement said that the laws pertaining to this issue have been successful around the world, hence it is essential to enact this bill.[3].The government also clarified that there is no intention to curb the fertility rate of minority as the sole aim of the bill is to control the population of the whole state irrespective of any religion, case, creed and sect, thus, there must not be any restlessness among any community.However, the commission head Justice Mittal claims that the economic, ecological, and social resources were at the periphery for perishing, thus supporting the bill.They claim that this bill can enable proper checks on population, help in the proper implementation of socialism in the scope of the faculty of India. Also, the community claims that this bill will be proved as watershed in the development of Uttar Pradesh. Is this law really needed?Considering the total fertility rate of the state, the resources are under a threat of getting exhausted sooner or later in the future. Therefore, it is essential to come up with active steps to curb the population boom in the state. The population of UP is on the verge of reaching 230 million which is not ideal considering the resources, the education and life expectancy of the state. The secular nature of this law drafted on the direction of the government, shows its intention is to not harm any religion, but to treat everyone the same, as enshrined in the basic ethos of article 15 of Indian Constitution. The right to enjoyment of life is under article 21 of the Constitution but it is subjected to limitations when it causes social, economic, and ecological impact. India has the world’s 2% landmass and the massive population of 15% of the world’s population. The surge in the population can put a burden on the resources and affect quality education, nutritious food, better life and skill management. These adverse effects of the surge in the population play a villain against economic development, employment, income distribution, poverty and social evolution. The exponential growth will only lead to huge repercussions on universal access to health care, education, housing, sanitation, water, food and energy. So to avail better quality life with a mix of good employment, food, water, sanitation, housing, education, and health, it is really important to enact this law. To avoid any confusion, government can rebate some complications in the law so to facilitate proper constructive framework and to pave way for collective, constructive, cognitive, and cooperative approach.Way forwardThe basic reason for the population outburst is obliviousness and unawareness about the perks of having limited child. During 1970s and 1980s it was normal to have five or six children because back then the socio-economic and health institutions were not as advanced as currently they are in the present. Majority of the people were not as educated as current generation is, so people must be more aware and there must be widespread awareness programs in collaboration with obstetricians and gynecologists to make people aware about contraceptive measures for safe sexual intercourse. Another cause for this outburst is when a girl is married at early age she is capable for bearing more children hence there must be stringent norms for child marriages[4].The much-talked population control bill for whole India would be detrimental in case of whole India as it will impact collectively on all the states, currently India’s TFR is 2.2 which is observed to be declining so it’s better for the decentralized legislation to be implemented in states which have greater TFR like Bihar, UP, Jharkhand, MP, Rajasthan etc[5].Hence this law must be applied with utmost sincerity and with diligence; if this is well implemented then it can help the citizens to have quality life. Also, Government must increase the incentives so to attract more people and foster their sincerity for this law. U.P govt. also have to ensure that there must not be any targeting to any particular community but the secular concept must be maintained.This article is edited by Kavana Rao.[1] https://theprint.in/opinion/cm-yogis-up-population-control-bill-is-designed-to-serve-only-one-purpose-2022-election/695550/[2] https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/up-population-control-bill-draft-396420.pdf[3] https://theprint.in/opinion/cm-yogis-up-population-control-bill-is-designed-to-serve-only-one-purpose-2022-election/695550/[4] https://ispeaklegal.medium.com/population-bill-and-the-areas-of-concern-ad8a666675f3[5] http://niti.gov.in/content/total-fertility-rate-tfr-birth-woman"

Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act,1960 was also great step in defining the terms as to what constituted animal cruelty. Although, these rules are being implemented to protect the animal, they are not stringent and most of the people fail to follow guidelines, continuing to harm animals without any fear of getting punished.

    "data": "This article is written by Karpagam from VIT ChennaiCase law: Susmita Saha Dutta vs Union of India & OrsViolence:Election results released on May 2 2021, on the same day West Bengal saw a spate of violent incidents. The BJP and the ruling Trinamool Congress have blamed the deaths of several party workers. Many suffered sexual assault and other serious injuries. Young girls were also sexually abused, many buildings were damaged and many were forced to leave their homes and some were forced to move to another country. Applicant’s lawyer Vishnu Shankar alleged that supporters of the Trinamool Congress raped women and looted Hindu property. Many of their complaints were not recorded by the police despite the prima facie’ disclosure of the commission’s case. The surprising fact is that many authorities said that they had not received any complaints but when the opportunity was given to the complainants to lodge complaints with the NHRC / legal aid authority, the authorities were filled with complaints.High Court’s views on post poll violence:The Calcutta high Court set up a five-judge bench consisting of Chief Justice Rajesh Bindal, Justice I.P. Mukerji, Harish Tandon, Soumen Sen and Subrata Talkudar to take a good look at the violence in the polling stations in Bangal. The last bench of 5 judges was built in Calcutta 16 years ago because usually five judges’ benches are built to resolve constitutional disputes. In a PIL action filed by attorney Anindya Sunder Das, the court ordered the government to notify the action taken against those accused of murder or of damaging property during the resulting violence. Justice Bindal said it was the responsibility of the central government to maintain order after the results of the polls were published. When Dutta’s attorney general said that the administration was under the Indian Electoral Commission and not under the government of the country but as soon as he took the oath of office on May 5, the Chief Minister took a number of steps to curb violence and action on those incidents. Advocate Pal also said that in the event of post-election violence, a constitutional matter is being discussed; he argued that until the results of the elections were published the states should be kept under the control of the Indian Electoral Commission. Then how could the state take action this time during this period! The Calcutta High Court has issued a statement questioning DCP Rashid Munir Khan, why he should not be prosecuted for failing to protect the Human Rights Commission’s investigation into post-poll violence in West Bengal. According to Atif Rasheed, Deputy Chairman of the National Commission for Minorities and a member of the NHRC team, he suspected that people were chasing him during a visit to Jadavpur on June 29 to inquire about the violence, despite informing the regional Magistrate about their visit. The court ruled that prima facie he was responsible for the post-election violence and ordered West Bengal police to file a case in accordance with NHRC recommendations or how it is reported. However, it is not public. On June 30 the committee submitted a brief report to the high court and asked for more time for the full documentation to reach all areas of violence. The court has asked the West Bengal government to provide appropriate treatment for those injured in the violence. It also ordered authorities to exhume the body of Bharatiya Janata Party employee Avijit Sarkar, who was allegedly killed by members of the Trinamool Congress during the dispute.Supreme Court Views:In May 2021, the PIL filed by the bench of judges Justice Vineet Saran and B R Gavai called on the SC to intervene to prevent post-election violence in the province. In its response the TMC government has said that the allegations in the High Court that the state machinery is part of the violence is false and misleading. The state also said that not all violence in this incident could be considered post-poll violence. By order of the high court, NHRC chairman Justice Arun Mishra had set up a committee to investigate the matter. On the same day, the high court refused to reconsider its order to request a civil rights inquiry. The western government of Bengal has asked the court to review and reverse the order. The SC also issued a notice to the violence investigation team.Show cause notice to the DCP:The court issued a notice for the Calcutta deputy police commissioner and asked why charges of contempt should not be initiated. “Notice must be given to Rashid Munir Khan, Deputy Commissioner of Police, South suburban Division, Kolkata to state the reason why his contemptible action against the breach of order issued by this court on June 18, 2021”, the bench ruled. An interim NHRC report stated that Atif Rasheed, a member of the committee, was barred from performing his duties when he and his party members were attacked by chiefs on June 29 in the Jadavpur area of police in the South suburban Division. Can the DCP be held liable? The preamble to the Indian constitution makes it clear that no one is above the law. Under the Indian constitution police, it is a matter of the state and the governments of the country have a responsibility to provide efficient police services. According to sec 23 of The Indian Police Act it will be the duty of every police officer to carry out all orders and warrants given to him, to collect and communicate with intelligence affecting the public peace, to prevent the commission of public nuisance, to detect and bring offences to justice etc. these days people have little hope in the police. Under current law the only independent authority with the power to investigate the police is NHRC . It can only advise the government; it has no power to force the government to listen to them. The committee constituted by Justice J.S. Verma called for a change in police reform so that individuals could be held accountable. The police are protected under the sec 197 and 132 CrPC , that is, they need permission from the state or central government before any disciplinary action is charged against them. Substantive protections under section 197 only apply if convicted police officers can prove that an alleged illegal act was performing a legal duty while doing so. But sometimes the protection given in sec. 197 has been misused by the police for not filing a complaint or FIR, which has become a major obstacle in reporting the wrong doing. The DCP is therefore liable for not performing his duty under section 23 of the Indian Police Act and abuses the protection of section 197 under the CrPC.References:https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/west-bengal-post-poll-violence-calcutta-high-court-issues-contempt-notice-to-south-kolkata-dcp-over-alleged-obstruction-of-nhrc-team-176724https://www.latestlaws.com/latest-news/high-court-sets-up-rare-bench-on-post-poll-violence-in-west-bengal/https://m.timesofindia.com/india/state-found-on-a-wrong-foot-was-in-denial-mode-calcutta-high-court-on-post-poll-violence-in-bengal/amp_articleshow/84068210.cms"

    "data": "Written By Eugenia Enyonam DatsomorIt is of no doubt that the Covid-19 pandemic has caused more harm than good. However, the main issue at hand has to do with restraint. Thus, how far can the court go in relation with suggestions to tackle Covid. We all have rights and need unity to be able to fight the pandemic but are there restrictions related to this. Where do we draw the partition for courts?The Allahabad High Court issued the upgrade of medical facilities in the state of Uttar Pradesh on 17th May with regards to the second wave of the Covid-19 pandemic. This was heard by the Supreme Court which was adjourned to 12th August 2021. It was said that the Allahabad High Court on 17th May had passed directions for the provision regarding ambulances with ICU facilities in all villages, making oxygen beds available in all nursing homes, upgrade of medical college hospitals and many more on an urgent basis in a time-bound manner considering the second wave of the pandemic.It should be noted that the directions given by the high court were difficult to implement. Some of these were, two ambulances with ICU facilities in one month in about 97000 villages, medical college hospitals should be upgraded to the level of Sanjay Gandhi Postgraduate institute within four months and some others. The Solicitor General made mention that the High Court should refrain from orders that cannot be implemented. It was also mentioned that the court needs to adhere to separation of powers.Justice Maheshwari stated that “there are certain issues which are the domain of the executive and at this time of crisis everyone has to proceed cautiously and take note of what is to be done by whom. Every institution has norms which they work with”. It was also said that the High Court’s directions wouldn’t be treated as an order but rather an advice to the UP government.CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS From Article 50 of the Indian Constitution, the separation of powers between the executive and judiciary is provided. In some cases like, Bandhuvia Mukti Morcha v Union of India as well as the case of Keshavananda Bharati vs. State of Kerala, though not substantially mentioned by the constitution, but it can be implied that the constitution makes use of separation of powers by allocating different roles to the different bodies of government. This is evident as if we talk about Article 53, it talks of executive power with the President as then head and governors at different stages as per Article 154. Powers of legislature resides in the house of parliament, thus Article 79 and State legislative bodies; Article 168 all of the Indian Constitution.OBSERVATION In my view, though some powers and functions overlap due to Checks and Balances, there’s a border for each and every function where one organ should not cross to perform the function of another. Though adjourned for August, it is of my opinion that the courts should not be able to cross over to the executive arena although suggestions can be given, As even the court also stated that “Collective efforts are needed during times of crisis, but good intent itself does not give everybody a right to enter into a different arena”.This article has been edited by Dhruv Kapoor.

    "headline": "MAINTENANCE AND WELFARE OF PARENTS AND SENIOR CITIZENS- CITIZENS ACT, 2007, A LIFELINE FOR AGED?Secret Ballot- A Necessity for Maintaining DemocracyMr. Harish Salve, A Lawyer Par ExcellenceUTTARAKHAND HIGH COURT TO EXAMINE PRISONERS’ RIGHT TO PROCREATE",
    "data": "CASE LAW: RAMESH PAPPI VS ISHWAR DEVIFACTUAL BACKGROUND:A 76-year-old widow filed a case who was left by her husband, with one house and one shop in order to ensure her welfare. Afterwards, his son started beating her and took the house as well as the shop in his name by means of fraud in 2015. The widow went to the Panchayat authorities to have conciliation proceedings two or three times, but those results in vain. Due to which, she approached to the Magistrate under the Tohana sub-council (SDM) in Fatehabad, acting as a maintenance court by filing an application under Section 5(1) of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 to get the registry of the house and a shop to be returned to her and for protection of her life, liberty and property as maintenance.SDM in August 19, 2019 ordered the son to return the house on behalf of the mother and provide ₹ 2,000 a month as subsistence allowance for her. And later on September 4, 2015, the transfer title deed was ordered to be cancelled by SDM. Contrary to the order, the son went to the appellate court, in Fatehabad, who overturned the findings but demanded that the widow to be paid maintenance and allowed to stay in her house. The order was challenged by a widow before a single judge’s bench on February 12, 2020 where the SDM order was ordered to be continued. Prior to the bench, the son had challenged the order of the single bench. Now, the high court upheld the order by SDM.ISSUE:Is the act named Maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens act, 2007 act as a lifeline for aged? OBJECTIVES OF THE ACT:This act imposes obligations on children to keep their parents / grandparents and an adult relative to treat with utmost care .The main attractions of this act are the provisions to protect the health and property of old age people. This initiative also provides for the establishment of old age homes for the elderly and the poor and it gives speedy remedies.COURT’S JUDGEMENT AND OBSERVATION:The Court found out that the petitioner’s claim of SDM passing an order which grants relief beyond what the respondent had requested was not fully understood. The Court noted that the respondent in pleading with the SDM had implied that her son had evicted her from the house fraudulently by transferring the house in his name. In addition, Section 5 (1) (c) of the 2007 Act empowers the SDM to take Suo Moto cognizance in this regard. The Court ruled out that “Where there is a provision of empowerment, it cannot be said that the SDM operated voluntarily without its capacity and provided relief in addition to the demand requested by Respondent No.1-Ishwar Devi”.The main motto behind the parliament is to enact the Senior Citizens Act is to uphold the respect and dignity of an old age people. The old age people had faced a lot of challenges and state has lot of concern towards that. They face emotional and psychological difficulties along with physical vulnerabilities. They are totally dependent because of these difficulties. Rationalising the wellbeing of all people in the society is the moral law formulated through the legislation. The moral values that existed in the past in our society have been accepted as universal principles when the time passes. The state has considered the acceptance of such values and with the help of The Senior Citizens Act, it seeks to promote the common good. The Court further noted that the SDM’s order was well-founded and well-informed after a thorough investigation. The SDM contacted the relevant parties that is the respondent and petitioner and concluded that the applicant had neglected his mother and had not provided her with the basic resources even though the house had been transferred in his name.On the contrary, the Court found that the order issued by the Appellate Tribunal was “evasive, imperceptible and erroneous in the eyes of the law and such use of force must be curtailed”. Accordingly, the Court concluded that the SDM exercised its jurisdiction under Section 23 of the 2007 Act and cancelling the relevant transfer of title to protect the interests of the aging defendant was permissible. To open the need for Section 23 (1) of the 2007 Act to protect the interests of elderly parents who are often at risk, the Court said,Section 23 (1) of the 2007 Act stipulates that in the event that children fail to care for their parents after the transfer of their parent’s property, such transfer will be deemed to be fraudulent or coercive and under the influence of the Court. The provision under Section 23 (1) of the 2007 Act seeks to provide older persons with a dignified manner. “Accordingly, the Court rejected the petition in compliance with the order of the Single Court Judge and gave effect to the directions which was put forth by the SDM.RELATED CASE LAWS:Can Older Citizens Expel Children From Their Homes?In the latter case, the Bombay High Court while highlighting the provisions of the Senior Citizen Act, 2007 (Senior Citizen Act) stated that the Act allows an adult including a parent who is unable to support himself or herself out of his or her income or be deprived of his or her property and if that adult citizen is unable to live a normal life to apply for this exemption i.e. removal under Section 4 of the Act not only for his or her children but also for grandchildren. In this case, the Respondent’s mother had lodged a complaint against the claimant (her son) with the other requesting that the maintenance be paid and the claimant’s reasons removed for various reasons. The Tribunal issued an order directing the applicant and other family members to withdraw from the tenure specified under Section 4 of the Maintenance and Welfare of Parents and Senior Citizens Act, 2007 (Senior Citizen Act). It would be fair to say here that the impugned premises belonged only to the Respondent’s mother. Dissatisfied with the above order, the petitioner filed a written petition before the Bombay High Court arguing that since the petitioner was keeping respondent number 1 for last few years, no eviction order could be issued by a court under Section 4 of the Older Persons Act.In this case, the Uttarakhand High Court while recognizing the State’s failure to provide adequate old age homes for the elderly in the State has issued a number of binding orders.The highlight of this case was that it gave the senior or old age people their rights over immovable property and eviction of abusive children.FINAL THOUGHTS:Definitely, this act acted as a lifeline for old people because it clearly defines the duties which should be paved by the children as well as grandchildren and it clears all the ambiguities thereby reduced the difficulties of the old aged.REFERENCES:Dattatrey Shivaji Mane v.

    "headline": "How Effective Are Tribal Laws in India?Data Protection and its Importance.RESTRICTION OF INTERNET SERVICES IN J&K: IS IT JUSTIFIED?FIXING ACCOUNTABILITY OF JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE (IN THE CONTEXT OF TAMIL NADU FATHER-SON CUSTODIAL DEATH)",
    "data": "This article is written by Vaasu Agrawal.IntroductionTribes are the integral part of our eclectic Indian Society, surviving mainly in Eastern and North Eastern states like Andhra Pradesh, Arunachal Pradesh, Assam and in central and southern plains. These are minority groups which are often suppressed or overlooked by the state and they continue to have a spat with the authority and law makers, as they vehemently oppose any legislation which takes away their indigenous culture. Considering this, several laws have been made which broaden the horizon of these communities and prioritize them over the rest of the population. The ultimate question is whether the laws created for these communities are doing any good or if it is merely on paper.LegislationsThere are plenty of legislations and legal provisions stipulated in the constitution itself and there have been a number of rulings and judgements by the Apex court in this regard. Firstly, the constitution provides greater autonomy to the tribal population of Central and Southern highlands and North Eastern tribes under fifth and sixth schedule respectively. These Schedules were part of the Indian Constitution since independence as the constitution framers have observed and anticipated the stance and predicted the fate of tribal communities. This is further substantiated by the landmark judgement by Supreme Court in Samantha v. State of Andhra Pradesh, where the Apex court held that transfer of land belonging to the tribes, to any third party as void and would be seen as encroachment upon the fundamental rights of tribals as well. This was indeed a core judgement in the favor of tribes, however, there have been a number of instances where this is dishonored and the Supreme court remains silent and does not haul to enforce its contempt jurisdiction. The Schedule Caste and Scheduled Tribes Act was passed in 1989, this was a big breakthrough, and it was made to ensure more safety and sophistication to the tribes. Though there were flaws in this act, it provided a sufficient sense of security to tribals. However, this legislation was later alleged by many communities, largely by upper castes as according to their appeal, this particular act was not in accordance with the spirit of constitutional equality.One such significant legislation was made in 1996, Provisions of the Panchayat (Extension to Scheduled Areas) Act, or PESA. This was going to bring a rebellion, as the motive behind this act, was to transfer power to the people. It was intended to be passed only in tribal regions of Central and Southern Highlands. It was formulated in such a manner which made it unique and gathered criticisms from the people already in power. Although the motive was positive, which was to protect the tribes from the oppression of the people in power, it failed to bring the act into reality. Many respective states adopted PESA, but on ground reality has proven beyond doubt that it is a mere paper law, which was believed to be radical. States while adopting this law, deliberately misinterpreted the clauses by playing with the words of the Act itself. This made the act dubious and in circumstances of any legislation being vague, the state assumes power to discard or reject some of its provisions.PrecedentsThere happened a big legal tussle in the landmark case of Subhash Kashinath Mahajan V. State of Maharashtra, wherein an SC employee sued two of his senior officials on the prima facie that they made adverse comments about him in Annual confidential report. The petition of that employee contained that the adverse comments were made by the two seniors since he belonged to a lower caste. This was filed under SC ST Atrocities Act, harshly deals with the accused. Any complaint filed under this Act, won’t require any preliminary inquiry to be done, added to that, the remedy of Anticipatory Bail is not actionable under this particular legislation. However, these pointers were considered and well acknowledged by the Apex Court and granted bail to the accused. This stirred riots and conflicts leading to violent protests by Dalit groups, who strongly believed that the order passed by the Apex court diluted the act in a non-negotiable manner. Though, eventually the Parliament in order to settle the protest and handle the situation, over turned the order of Supreme Court by introducing an amendment in the Act.ConclusionCan we move on like this or is there really something where we can work upon? The author still believes that we have great infrastructure and ideal legislations, the core problem is over regulation and under administration, which can be addressed by taking recourse to judiciary as much as possible. Disobeying judicial decree must attract a hefty punitive action, thus creating a deterrent among the states, and compel the them to adhere to the regulations and norms.This article is edited by Kavana Rao."

GNCTD: UNFAIR TO EXPECT CHILDREN ORPHANED DUE TO COVID TO PROCURE DOCUMENTS FOR AVAILING BENEFITS UNDER WELFARE SCHEMES: DELHI HCCHILD AS A CONSUMER: PERSPECTIVE FROM LAW AND BEHAVIOURRESIDUAL DOUBT THEORY: AN ADDITION TO INDIAN CAPITAL SENTENCE JURISPRUDENCE",
    "data": "Written by Akash Datta, Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies.Introduction The concept of legal literacy and knowledge is founded on the premise that everyone should be informed of their rights and responsibilities. The legal maxim ignorantia juris non-excusat, or ‘ignorance of the law is no excuse,’ means that the Court assumes that all parties are aware of the law and that ignorance of the law cannot be used as a defence to avoid culpability. The common law system encompasses this Latin maxim and its several legal ramifications. It was created by imperialist western countries and has persisted in India’s legal system as a result of the country’s past as a British colony. However, if one were to take stock of the state of India’s literacy, the aforementioned maxim would be an obnoxious assumption grounded in idealistic tenets. Thus, it is extremely urgent to acknowledge the problem of legal illiteracy in India.What Is The Situation?The COVID-19 pandemic has brought to light the dreadful consequences of legal illiteracy in India. If India had been more legally informed during the pandemic, grave human rights abuses could have been avoided.For instance, domestic violence complaints filed during the lockdown were at a 10 year high during 2020.[i]This number is particularly disturbing because 86 percent of women in India who are victims of domestic abuse do not seek help. Another concerning tendency is the abuse of police authority and an increase in police violence during the lockdown. The impoverished and illiterates were frequently arbitrarily detained for minor offences. Furthermore, the rise of virtual courts has impeded access to justice for those who are technologically challenged. In addition, there has been an increase in labour law violations and the emergence of ethical concerns. It is a valid argument that the lack of legal knowledge in India is to blame for the majority of these concerns of rights deprivation.Why Is It So?Due to ignorance of law being so common, offenders frequently learn about a law forbidding something after they have committed a crime. Hence, they are unaware of the legal ramifications of their actions. People living in a society are to a certain extent part of a social contract wherein they have surrendered some rights and agreed to certain obligations. People in India just do not understand their rights and duties under the social compact.Around 35% of India’s population does not have a formal education. People, particularly women and children, are ignorant of the enforceability of human rights, therefore they do not report crimes, and the offenders go unpunished. Despite the fact that there is no gauge or scale that measures legal knowledge, India still has a long way to go before it meets the preconditions necessary to properly apply the rule of ignorentia juris non excusat.A fundamental obstacle to legal literacy is the preconceived assumption that the law is inherently complicated and can only be comprehended by those in the legal profession. This is further reinforced by overly long and verbose court statements. The wording may be so complicated that even judges and lawyers struggle to understand it, let alone common people. The complexity of legalese has limited legal understanding to a select few. It is high that court emphasizes the importance of writing decisions that are complete yet brief, lucid, and succinct, so that they can be read and understood without trouble.Another cause is the legislature’s failure to make an attempt to make legislation language more understandable. The majority of the effort in the direction of legal literacy has come from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and civil society organisations that operate in the field of legal assistance. Legal awareness camps for disadvantaged social groups are organised by NGOs such as CLAP India [ii]and MARG[iii], who educate them on their rights and safeguards under the Constitution and other laws.How To Solve This Problem?As part of the Directive Principles of State Policy, Article 39A of the Constitution requires the government to provide free legal assistance to the needy. The ‘rule of law’ is mainly promoted by Articles 14 and 22(1). Other judicial statements from various courts have emphasised the same point. As a result, the state is required to provide citizens with a basic level of legal understanding in order to successfully defend the fundamental and other rights.The Committee for Implementing Legal Aid Schemes [iv]was established in 1980 under the leadership of Justice PN Bhagwati. As a result, the National Legal Services Authority was created in 1995. At the national, state, and district levels, the authority has a hierarchical structure. One of the main responsibilities of these legal services agencies is to organise legal literacy and awareness initiatives in conjunction with non-governmental organisations.The National Legal Literacy Mission, with the tagline “from ignorance to legal empowerment,” was established in 2005 to educate minority populations, particularly women and children. All eligible individuals listed in Section 12 of the Legal Services Authority Act, 1987, were included in the mission’s target group, which included the most indigent, distraught, vulnerable, and victimised individuals, such as women and children from SC, ST, OBC, minority communities, or tribal areas, among others. The project also attempts to make the legal language more understandable. However, because it was not given its own budget, the mission was not very successful.NALSA offers a number of initiatives aimed at promoting legal literacy and awareness, such as establishing Legal Literacy Clubs in schools and universities. The groups strive to raise student understanding of legal rights, responsibilities, and obligations. Ragging, female foeticide, child marriage, right to education, domestic violence, legislation against human trafficking, sexual harassment, rape, and other concerns are addressed by the clubs’ campaigns.Various initiatives have been launched by State Legal Services Authorities across India to address this issue. The Himanchal Pradesh LSA has successfully included chapters on rights and responsibilities in school textbooks, the Chandigarh LSA organises street plays and workshops on a regular basis, and the Delhi LSA has taken a variety of initiatives, including radio programmes, film documentaries, and publishing advertisements in books and magazines, among others. There isn’t a model for a straight jacket,depending on the population in a specific location, the authorities use a variety of ways.Government-led initiatives such as the National Legal Literacy Month and non-governmental organisation (NGO) seminars have attempted to orient individuals toward improved legal literacy, although the research on their efficacy is mixed. To guarantee that legal literacy initiatives are tailored to the requirements of each community, a policy initiative based on the cooperative federalism concept should be taken. Legal literacy should begin at the Zila panchayat level, with adult literacy programmes instilling basic legal understanding. Furthermore, law as a subject should be taught in elementary school education to teach young children on basic laws, rights, and responsibilities using a vernacular language as the medium of instruction.CONCLUSIONIt’s also critical to make changes at the legislative level, such as eliminating needless legalese and redundancy in statutes and ordinances. The individuals who are controlled by laws should not find it difficult to comprehend them.Finally, the court must accept responsibility for making justice more accessible to all people, regardless of their economic or social circumstances. For the purpose of clarity for laypeople, courts should avoid employing complex terminology in judicial declarations.In our nation, mass legal education will make policy execution much easier. Until then, the phrase ignorentia juris non excusat will continue to be associated with social injustice.Curated by Kavana Rao.

    "headline": "POLITICAL CAREER OF KIREN RIJIJU (MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE)Who will be the next Chief Minister of U.P: Lets find outCHALLENGE ON THE SELECTION OF BJP VICE PRESIDENT AS NHRC MEMBER: SC ISSUES NOTICEWOMEN SAFETY IN A CAB",
    "data": "This article is written by Karpagam from VIT Chennai.Introduction:Kiren Rijiju was born on November 19, 1971. Rijiju graduated from Hansraj College, University of Delhi and holds a law degree from the Campus Law Center, Faculty of Law, University of Delhi. From time to time, he writes articles on security and social and economic. A major reshuffle of the Union Cabinet on Wednesday carries with it the technical and administrative mark of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Kiren Rijiju, who swore as Cabinet Minister in this major change, has been appointed Minister of Law and Justice of the Union in Modi 2.0 government. He replaces Ravi Shankar Prasad, who resigned from the union Government on Wednesday. A total number of 43 leaders took oath of office to expand the Cabinet held at Darbar Hall in Rashtrapati Bhavan . Out of the 43, 15 were sworn in as Cabinet Ministers while 28 leaders were promoted as Minister of State (MoS). In the new Cabinet, four Cabinet Ministers, 18 state Ministers, 39 MLA’s and 23 MP’s have been elected three or more times.Political career:Rijiju is considered as the face of the Bharatiya Janata Party in North East India. He served as a Khadi Member and Commission for the Home Industry from 2000 to 2005 at a very young age of 29 years.In the 2004 general election, he was elected as the 14th member of Lok Sabha, representing the Arunachal West constituency in the Indian Parliament, the fourth largest constituency in India. Rijiju entered Lok Sabha for the second time in 2014 from the Arunachal (West) region of Arunachal Pradesh in India.During 2004-09, Rijiju was placed among the main opposition MPs who were reviewed by their peers on the treasury bench based on the top bench in negotiations and embellishments and was placed among experts such as L. Advani. He was re-elected as the leading Member of Parliament for many National news organizations and magazines.In the 2009 general election, Rijiju was defeated by a narrow margin of 1314 votes by a candidate for Congress in the midst of a highly controversial situation that sparked widespread violence over allegations of a ballot by the Congress Party. In the 2014 general election, Rijiju was re-elected as the 16th Member of Parliament for Lok Sabha, representing the Arunachal West constituency.Rijiju, at the time of the Rohingya refugee crisis in 2017, said “Rohingyas are illegal immigrants and should be deported”. He also pointed out that “India has already taken the highest number of refugees in the world so no one should give India lessons on how to deal with refugees”.In May 2019, Rijiju became the Minister of State (Independent) for Youth and Sport Affairs and the Minister of State for Home Affairs. In July 2021, he became the Minister of Justice and Justice in the Department of Second Modi during the Cabinet reshuffle.Kiran Rijiju’s views on the new position:He said he was aware of the responsibility entrusted to him, and that he was prepared to face the challenges ahead. “Now is not the time to talk about ideas , now is the time to act,” he told NDTV. When the question raised if he could get help from his predecessor – Ravi Shankar Prasad – he said that he would be informed by senior officials of the Legal Department on pending issues, and also said “It’s always about teamwork; it’s about participation. Nothing happens alone.”“Entering this room (for the first time) is a big challenge and my job is to do my role as Minister of law and Justice. I have a law degree but I don’t have much experience working but everything can be managed with leadership and support. We will try to be transparent, we don’t want to make too many comments now.” Mr Rijiju told reporters. He also thanked Prime Minister Narendra Modi for “showing confidence in his strengths”.Conclusion:The Legal Department is responsible for protecting the government in various courts through its legal authorities and for assisting ministers to make debt and key documents. It also contributes to the transfer, submission and promotion of the Supreme Court and the judges of the high court. The filling of vacancies in the Supreme Court and the 25 High Courts and the additional appointment of judicial officers in the lower courts are major challenges before the new Minister of Justice. Improving justice infrastructure and technological advancement, especially during the COVID-19 era when the courts are operating almost exclusively; the creation of an Indian judicial service that delays the process of police recruitment in the lower courts and India’s speculation as a major platform for resolving some of the key challenges before it.References1.

    "headline": "COMPENSATORY PROVISIONS FOR ELECTRICAL ACCIDENTS IN INDIACYBER LAWS IN INDIA: EFFECTIVENESS14-Year-Old Dalit girl ‘Gangraped and burnt alive’.Pre-Trial Prejudice: Time To Identify The Evil In India?",
    "data": "This article is written by Deepali Gupta from Amity Law School, NoidaINTRODUCTIONElectricity has become so ingrained in modern life that it is difficult to fathom life without it. However, with the benefits and convenience of power comes risks. Electricity is a ubiquitous energy agent to which many employees in many jobs and sectors are exposed to daily as part of their employment. Moreover, it affects a large number of people in a variety of day-to-day tasks. Electricity use can cause morbidity and mortality, which can typically be avoided with basic safety precautions. Almost all electrocution deaths are unintentional, while homicides and suicides caused by electricity are rare.Electrocution-related deaths have a distinct pattern all around the world. Electrocution-related deaths are uncommon in the Western world because of robust safety procedures and a high degree of knowledge. On the other hand, Suicides are reported in large numbers. In contrast, developing countries like India face significant number of electrocution-related deaths in comparison to suicide deaths.ELECTROCUTION IN INDIAEvery day, thirty Indians are electrocuted to death. When creating preventive measures and formulating an effective, transparent, and consistent victim compensation process, the legislature, executive, regulators, and electrical supply corporations have usually turned a blind eye.Electricity Act of 2003The comprehensive code on energy (The Electricity Act of 2003) , effectively separated the executive from tariff setting, regulation, and some dispute resolution tasks, which were handed to the quasi-judicial body known as the Electricity Regulatory Commission. Regulators do not resolve consumer complaints, and accident victims are not compensated. Thus, this law just assured that consumers pay power utilities and that the private sector generating firms, including renewable energy companies, regularly following regulated and promised returns. The open-access customers, major industrial and commercial consumers beyond the regulatory control scope, are the biggest benefactors of this regime. Large generators and merchants compete for profitable customers, whereas small and marginal customers are left at the mercy of monopolized distribution utilities. New types of intermediaries, such as electricity trading businesses and energy exchanges, gained significantly from guaranteed trading margins without investing in infrastructure. Consumers readily pay for everything and are considered a non-essential part of the process. COMPENSATORY PROVISIONS IN INDIACompensatory provisions in the Electricity Act of 2003Small and marginal farmers who lost their lands to generate stations, substations, and transmission lines for energy projects, particularly renewable energy projects like wind and solar, are not compensated under the 2003 Act, which is regarded as the complete code on electricity. The vulnerability of victims who die every day as a result of electrical accidents is even more extreme. These landless agricultural labourers continue to be the most vulnerable victims of this phenomenon, and there is no existing compensatory provision for accidental deaths in this electricity Act of 2003, which is widely lauded as energy independence around the world.Fatal Accidents Act,1855The Fatal Accidents Act of 1855 was passed to compensate families for losses incurred due to an individual’s actionable wrongdoing. Section 1A of The Fatal Accidents Act, allows the victim’s family to sue for compensation for the losses caused by his death resulting from an actionable wrong. According to Section 1-A of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855:“Suit for compensation to the family of a person for loss occasioned to it by his death by actionable wrong.–– Whenever the death of a person shall be caused by wrongful act, neglect or default, and the act, neglect or default is such as would (if death had not ensued) have entitled the party injured to maintain an action and recover damages in respect thereof, the party who would have been liable if death had not ensued shall be liable to an action or suit for damages, notwithstanding the death of the person injured, and although the death shall have been caused under such circumstances as an amount in law to a felony or other crime.”The victims are currently relegated to civil courts, where they must file civil claims and invoke the provisions of the Fatal Accidents Act, 1855, by paying an ad valorem court fee and filing civil litigation. This takes a long time and irritates the poor and helpless victims’ relatives. In the case of Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board V. Shail Kumari and Ors, the Supreme Court dismissed an appeal filed by an electricity board in 2002, holding that the strict liability principle applies to the acts and omissions of an electricity supply utility in case of electrical accidents and that the electricity supply utility has not been provided with a fast track and cost-effective compensation adjuration mechanism.STEPS NEED TO BE TAKENPeriodical inspection of electric wires and transformersThe central electricity authority and chief electrical inspectors rarely inspect the electrical safety of these facilities before or after projects even though they have a statutory duty to ensure and certify the safety of power plants and machines. As a result, millions of people in India are at risk due to the sagging electric wires and malfunctioning current transformers. Thus, pre-commissioning and periodic electrical inspections are just a ruse. The officials bear much less personal responsibility, for their indifference and negligence. Every electrical accident may be traced back to the jurisdictional electrical inspector of the state government and the electrical engineer of the distribution firm, resulting in a dramatic reduction in mishaps. Composition of special tribunalThe establishment of a specialized tribunal for awarding compensation is the second most crucial legislative reform in this regard. The best alternative may be to assign this authority to the MACTs (Motor Vehicle Accidents Tribunals) or to empower the regulatory commissions. What important is that, unless there are exceptions to the concept of strict liability established by case law, responsibility for all electrical accidents must be attributed to electrical inspectors of State Government-run electrical inspectorates and officials of power supply companies. Uniformity of solatiumThe intervention is to make sure that adequate and uniform solatium is awarded. Regulators in practically every state have established the solatium for deadly and non-fatal incidents. For example, in Karnataka and Andhra Pradesh, the figure has been set at five lakhs. However, it is set at four lakhs in Bihar, Telangana, and Odisha. The compensation amount does not follow a consistent pattern.These solatium amounts are no-fault liability compensations in which the Supply Companies are not required to confess their liability but are instead required to compensate the grieving families immediately. However, most victims are either utterly unaware of the existence of the solatium or believe that once these amounts have been approved, they will be unable to obtain additional compensations. To add to the uncertainty, KPTCL (Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation), has issued a circular stating that once the victim receives the solatium (compensation), she is forbidden from seeking additional remedies. This oddity causes most victims to not get solatium and are left high and dry in their legal battles.CONCLUSIONElectricity is one of the basic needs of human life. As every coin has two sides, it also comes with certain drawbacks. However, proper care and strict rules for maintaining electrical items can reduce electrocution cases in India.To reduce electrocution cases, the government needs to take specific actions mentioned in the article. Every State Government and Distribution Company must be required to set up a helpline with a nodal person and an Ombudsman to ensure that compensation is paid out as soon as possible. Section 42 of the Electricity Act 2003 Act has already established an Ombudsman structure for the consumer grievance resolution. This can also apply to those who have been injured or lost their lives in an electrical accident. The victims must also be informed that this is only a solatium and that they have every right to use the available resources under the law. Electricity Accident Claims Tribunals must also be established, as previously said. Another section of legislation that would eliminate the ad valorem court cost for accident victims would be beneficial. An alternative legislative change would eliminate the payment of ad valorem court fees by accident victims, which would go a long way toward ensuring that claims receive justice.These measures can help ensure that the big vision of an energy-independent India is found on a foundation of fair recompense.

    "data": "This Article is written by R. Jeeva Dharshini from VIT University, Chennai.INTRODUCTIONAll human rights are universal, inseparable and interdependent. However, there is no clear indication that such interdependence depends more on the freedom of speech and incitement of racial or religious hatred. Blasphemy is one of the world’s most abused law when it comes to suppressing the voices of minorities, rationalists and so on. However, the concept of declaring blasphemy as a crime does not apply to ordinary legal countries but to the rest of the world. These laws are commonly used to persecute people for beliefs around the world and that activities do not conform to majority opinion on religious and sensitive areas and to suppress criticism of religion. However, there is a huge difference between criticism and blasphemy. Many countries across the world have blasphemy laws in their penal system despite having different legal systems.HISTORYThe idea of blasphemy originated in Greece in AD 325. About the 12th or 13th century, the Jews provided a straightforward structure for blasphemy. With most Hindu population, there was no separate legislation in India against blasphemy till the year 1927.Prior to independence, a pamphlet was published by Mahashay Rajpal named Rangila Rasul. On its release in the year 1926, it sparked controversy, with Muslim community as it was against their religious sentiments. Eventually Rajpal was acquitted as there was no strong blasphemy law in India. As a result, in the year 1927, the British colonial government amended the Indian Penal Code ,1860 thus added the section 295(A). This section is present even after the partition of India in Indian Penal Code 1860 and also in Pakistan and Bangladesh. Though India and Pakistan followed the same criminal justice system, but Pakistan amended in the year 1980 to 1986 and included blasphemy as a penal offence.BLASPHEMY LAWS IN INDIARight to the religion of individuals to practice, profess and propagate not only religion but multifarious denominations thereof is embodied into the constitution of India. Same provisions also put reasonable restrictions on the state and the individual, as the exercise of the same rights should not be against public order, morality and national security of the country. To protect the rights of one individual against the other, Chapter XV was added to Indian penal code in 1927 as ‘offences relating to religion’. These are the blasphemy laws of India. This covers the following sections:Section 153 A of IPCThe purpose of Section 153 A is to punish persons who indulge in attack on religion, race, place of birth, place of residence, language or of any particular group or class or founders and prophets of religion which promotes enmity amo0ng them. The offense should be a tangible offense and the same penalty can be extended up to three years, either fined, or both. However, the punishment for a crime committed in a place of worship is increased up to five years and is liable for a fine.Section 154 of IPCThis section prohibits the incitement of hatred in name of religion but it doesn’t protect any religion rather the rights of the individual to practice their religion.Section 295 of IPCIf any person intentionally damages any religious objects that is deemed to be sacred by followers of any religion in India, other than idols and books, then they are punishable under this particular section with imprisonment up to two years or fine or both.Section 295 A of IPCIf a person maliciously by words spoken or written or signs or by visible representation insults or attempts to insult religious sentiments of any class of citizens of India then he may be punished under this section. A person can be imprisoned for 3 years or fined, or both under this section.Section 296 of IPCIf a person causes disturbance intentionally to any lawful religious assembly or ceremonies, then he shall be punished under this section of imprisonment up to one year or fine or both.Section 297 of IPCIf a person intentionally trespasses any burial place knowing that his act may cause hurt to the religious sentiments of any class of citizens is punished with imprisonment up to one year or fine or both under this section. This section is meant to protect the religious rights of dead persons.BLASPHEMY LAWS AND THE CONSTITUTIONBlasphemy is an uncommon term in the realm of the Indian Constitution, as the Indian court has long emphasized the nature of the inclusion of Hinduism, making the concept of blasphemy inconsistent.AnalysisRamji Lal Modi V State of UP,1957In this case, the court held that Section 295A was constitutionally valid in accordance with Article 19(2) of the Constitution, it was a reasonable restriction upon Freedom of speech, in the interest of the public order. It was also said that Sec 295A only punishes the aggravated form of insult to religion with malicious intention of outraging the religious feeling of that class. The calculated tendency of this most aggravated form of insult is to disrupt the public order and the section which penalises such activities is well within the protection of Article 19(2) as being a law with reasonable restrictions on freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution.Shreya Singhal V Union of IndiaThe Supreme Court held that only “incitement” violence could be prohibited under the public order, and even advocacy was allowed.BLASPHEMY LAW: ANTIETHICAL TO INDIA’S SECULAR ETHOSSection295(A) of the Indian Penal Code, violates the secular character of the Constitution. Blasphemy means, “speaking evil of sacred things”. In India, which is a secular state, there can be no law of blasphemy as such. Thus, in modern states, religious offences aim to uphold law and order rather God or faith. Section 295A was enacted to make malicious acts insulting the religious sentiments, or outraging the religious feelings, punishable as offences relating to religion whether or not they amount to attempts to promote feelings of enmity between classes as contained under section 153A of IPC (Sarvaria 2003). Our Constitution recognized the constitutional right of freedom of conscience of atheists and non-believers.St Xavier’s College v State of Gujrat- The court in this case held that “secularism is not anti-God or pro-God, it treats alike the devout, the agnostic and the atheist.” The rights of atheists to their freedom of conscience also extend to the right to propagate their ideas. However, the interpretation of Section 295A in a socio-political context, with its wider scope, directly undermines this constitutional right.Ram Ji Lal Modi v The State of UP (1957) – In this case, the constitutionality of the provision was challenged before the Honourable Court. The Supreme Court while holding the provision to be constitutional provided that only those insults which are taken up with deliberate and malicious intentions are covered under the section and not every insult to religion is covered under the said section. The Court thereby upheld the restriction on freedom of speech and expression and held that the provision has been created in favour of public order. However, the Court completely failed to appreciate on the point that not every insult of religion would necessarily lead to a law-and-order situation.CONCLUSIONThere is no doubt that blasphemy laws limit an individual’s right of freedom of speech and expression, but the issue is whether it is reasonable or not. To maintain peace and tranquillity it is the prime objective of ever individual and not to threaten the minorities and people of other religion. Laws should be made to punish people who makes derogatory comments over religious aims and sentiments of others. This allows the citizens to respect their right to express their thoughts and right to speech. When the society will be educated it will see this as a mooting problem and not as derogation to the religion.REFERENCES[Diganth Raj Sehgal], [Blasphemy laws in India and the contemporary world],[ipleaders],[1], [November 22, 2020][Gautam Bhatia ],[‘Blasphemy law’ and the Constitution],[ livemint] ,[1],[ 19 March,2016][Surbhi Karwa ,Shubham Kumar],[A Blasphemy Law is Antithetical to India’s Secular Ethos], [Vol. 54, Issue No. 37 ],[EPW Engage],[1], [14 September, 2019]Ramji Lal Modi V State of UP 1957 AIR 620, 1957 SCR 860.Shreya Singhal V Union of India AIR 2015 SC 1523.St Xavier’s College v State of Gujrat, 1974 AIR 1389This article is edited by Kavana Rao.

    "headline": "ETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF USING ONLINE MEETINGCHALLENGE ON THE SELECTION OF BJP VICE PRESIDENT AS NHRC MEMBER: SC ISSUES NOTICECONCEPT OF NATURAL JUSTICE IN INDIAIndia Ratifies Two ILO Conventions On International Day Against Child Labor",
    "data": "This article is written by Tanishka Bajaj from Vivekananda Institute of Professional Studies.ABOUTIt is said that “Necessity is the mother of invention”, coronavirus has forced everyone to rethink their daily lives from work to school to entertainment. After COVID-19 hit the world, there was a drastic change in the functioning of various professions. Most of them became dependent on technology either for conferences or court hearings. This has led to a shift in meetings and events, from in-person gatherings to virtual meetings. COVID-19 brought both challenges and opportunities. In response to work, school closures and recommendations to not gather in huge groups to restrain the spread of infection, it was important to come up with an alternative to digitally transform our places of work to function productively.COVID 19 has affected Indian Legal System like never before. It has shed light on outdated ways of delivering justice and has given an opportunity to underutilization of work tools and models which have been resisted by the Indian Legal System for a long time. The process of conducting depositions, arbitration, virtual hearings, mediation is likely to continue in the future.The concept of virtual courts is not new in India, in 2003 Supreme Court of India in State of Maharashtra V. Prafulla Desai held that recording of evidence by court should be considered as’ procedure established by law’. Since then, many subordinate courts have come up with guidelines with respect to Judicial Proceedings through video conferencing. Even then, everything has its both pros and cons. The transition from traditional method of delivering courtroom justice to virtual hearings has raised some genuine concerns among advocates and parties. Many people are concerned about their privacy and safety because of the new video conferencing method. Furthermore, some judicial administrators and parties have faced technical glitches which have hampered with the delivery of justice.ETHICAL CHALLENGES IN ONLINE MEETINGSExposure To HackingAs the number of people using online meeting platforms increase, reports indicate that configuration led to hacking incidents. This was due to the public sharing of meeting IDs on social media which might have been accessed by strangers. In India, one of the most common platforms for video conferencing is Zoom.Zoom hacking happens all over the world from anonymous meetings to sensitive and confidential government meetings. This is also known as Zoom bombing. Meetings that are scheduled without a password can easily be hacked. Zoom has since announced many improvements to its configuration and settings to reduce the risk of hacking, but people must understand how to implement those changes. Many video conferencing applications now require a password to access the conference calls, as well as a waiting room function which allows the host to manage participants, they enter the meeting. On the other hand, hosts should enable those settings to use the security feature.AccessibilityReports show how representatives of the bar stated that a considerable number of litigants and advocates lack internet connectivity as well as the necessary equipment that are required to engage in the process of virtual hearings. There is a risk that a significant portion of our population will be excluded from the legal system due to circumstances beyond their control. Furthermore, these challenges are likely to affect the lower court more. Internet connection is a luxury that is limited to a privileged few. The discrepancies in internet connections, distribution and access between urban and rural areas pose a significant hurdle to virtual administration of justice.The government has taken steps to ensure the accessibility of online resources to all, by establishing several e-Seva Kendra which provide information on the status of litigant’s case and other associated questions.Privacy and SecurityWhile adapting to a fully virtual way of delivering justice, the courts around the world have experienced intrusion in privacy of data for security reasons. Most virtual court proceedings in India are conducted using third party software or platforms, with a handful of them already been dismissed due to security reasons. Third party platforms constitute a security risk and are vulnerable to hacking and misuse. It was suggested that Ministry of Law and Justice and Ministry of Information Technology develop new software for India’s Judicial System to use and conduct virtual court proceedings.There are many legal technology start-ups that are operating in this field and their inventions can be used to generate modern capabilities and capacities for the Indian court system.Video Conferencing with Clients and ColleaguesWhen using technology to communicate with clients and colleagues, the major concern is the security of information related to the client’s representation. The duty of confidentiality “requires a lawyer to act competently to safeguard information relating to the representation of a client against unauthorized access by third parties and against inadvertent or unauthorized disclosure by the lawyer or other persons who are participating in the representation of the client or who are subject to the lawyer’s supervision.”PETITION TO BAN VIDEO CONFERENCING APP ZOOM IN INDIAHarsh Chugh, Delhi based tutor filed a case, arguing that the app should be banned for both official and personal use. Video conferencing platforms noticed an overnight spike in demand after COVID 19. Three Judge Supreme court panel headed by CJI Sharad Bobde issued notices to the Central government and Zoom seeking responses.“Poor privacy and security of the application have enabled the hackers to get access to the meetings, classes, and conferences being conducted online through this application. Zoom is reported to have a bug that can be abused intentionally to leak information of users to third parties,” said the plea.On 1st April, The Indian Ministry of Home affairs issued an advisory which stated that Zoom is not for official purposes. With more people going online and businesses digitizing workplaces to prepare for work-from-home, there is a need for a data security law that holds companies accountable for breaches. Zoom had publicly apologized for “misleadingly routing traffic through China,” where the Internet is strictly regulated.The Indian Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-In), the main cybersecurity organization, is also said to have alerted Zoom users about cyber threats, according to the complaint.DO’S AND DON’TS OF USING ONLINE MEETING PLATFORMSLocking Down Meetings – The good news is that many video conferencing apps have security features that might help you prevent problems like hacking. The bad news is that these safeties are left to users with little security training.Use waiting room feature – In a conferencing application, before the meeting, these features place participants in a separate virtual room and allow the host to admit only those who are supposed to be there.Enable password protection – Zoom generates a password and a meeting room ID automatically. You need to make sure your service has a separate password or PIN besides a meeting ID number and a string.Do not allow participants to share screen – Your software should have options for allowing hosts to control screen sharing. When a meeting has commenced, the host might allow selected attendees to share information when needed.Use the latest version of software – On older software versions, security flaws are more likely to be exploited. Zoom, for example, recently changed its software to require password-protected meetings and has suspended development on new features to focus on addressing privacy and security flaws, implying that more modifications are on the way.GUIDELINES BY GOVERNMENT TO MAINTAIN ETHINICITY IN COURT WHILE USING VIDEO CONFERENCELearned Advocates / In-Person Parties are requested to download the “Jitsi Meet” application from the Android Play Store or the Apple Store on their mobile phones. If you want to use the app on a laptop or desktop, go to URL –https://meet.jit.si/ can be accessed with a web browser. Users are not required to create an account on the application.The concerned Advocates/Parties shall intimate their preference to appear through Video Conferencing and state the following: –Case Number and Item Number in Cause ListName of Advocate / PartyParty for whom appearance is soughtE-mail ID where VC related intimation shall be sent e. Mobile Phone Number (preferably where WhatsApp is installed)Despite the foregoing, the concerned Bench may direct which and how many participants may be admitted to a VC session at any given moment, taking into account the operation of the VC program and other relevant variables.Silence should be maintained in the surrounding area so that the Hon’ble Bench and the Counsel can communicate via VC without being disturbed.WAY FORWARDInformation technology has meant that the administration of justice is not impeded even in these exceptional times. To mitigate the effects of the worldwide pandemic, the Indian legal system is growing increasingly reliant on IT-enabled virtual systems and communication capabilities. Despite the obstacles of this new system, virtual technology is flourishing here.All of these are indicators that the Indian legal system is on the verge of modernization. The legal culture will be transformed and changed because of this pandemic. "

    "data": "This article has been written by S. KarpagamIntroduction:Prison overcrowding has become a constant problem in this country, high levels of human settlements can only mean bad news in the midst of the epidemic. The Supreme Court has been intervening from time to time to resolve this issue, but its latest order to regulate the temporary release of qualified prisoners is gaining traction due to the second uncontrolled increase in this epidemic. The prison is said to be famous for holding a mirror in public. The conditions inside the prisons, to extend this analogy, reflect the quality of any democracy. With that stick, India needs a soul search. Not only has our deteriorating justice system not ensured immediate prosecution but alcohol and testing (or impartiality) investigations and prosecutions have ensured that terriers suffer in prisons for decades. Courts rarely intervene to ensure that a thorough investigation is carried out with strict prosecution, or the conclusion of a probationary period.The government’s most visible plan to deal with the Covid-19 pandemic was carried out with extensive instructions on legal and illegal activities. These closure rules and regulations were vague, progressive and unequal. Already powerful police forces, registers of abusers, strong colonial legacy and free will make discriminated communities an unequal guilt, an epidemic from its earliest days became a tool to continue harassing these neglected groups. We have seen tangible evidence in the media of police excesses during beatings, hard work or punishment. The pictures themselves showed who these people were at the end of the violence; they were street vendors, small vegetable sellers, milk or meat sellers and other neglected groups.Consequences and challenges of FIR:In a statement by live law, 34000 arrest records and 500 FIRS and that one in five FIRs were against street vendors or small shop owners. The FIR value against pedestrians increased from 50% for the first and second locks to 89% during the third lock. Most of these FIRs were installed due to police patrols. As a result of investigations with pedestrians, most FIRs were cases of movement of essential services such as gas or medicine. But more than 90% FIR in virtual-copy-mode mode only attaches to the fact that a person has been found violating the closure and their reasons are considered unsatisfactory, ‘unnecessary’, ‘inappropriate’, ‘vague’ or ‘invalid’. It was clear that there was no check on the police’s actions in enforcing the ban. The FIR should only state the facts and circumstances of a particular situation, not a police decision on a particular matter. Crime stories are therefore created by the police using their understanding as the last word of the law, and the same was used to unequally identify groups of the poor or disadvantaged.In addition to shopkeepers, street vendors too were slapped with FIRS, many of which provided essential services and goods without the necessary closure. With regard to the people selling meat and dairy products, it was found that most FIRs were opposed to the people of the Muslim community. Some of them have been charged with minor offenses such as arriving late to close a shop despite having permission from the District Magistrate, etc. In total, 6000 people were arrested for criminal offenses alone, while more than 4000 others were arrested for minor offenses such as drinking alcohol, breaking the law or gambling temporarily for between 100 Rupees to 500 rupees. 10.85% of the people arrested under property laws were women. Most FIRs in lockdown to MP were standard as a template with few changes; same complaints, sometimes with the same informant. For example, there was one informant Patwari who found more than 150 FIRS, one and the same, registered at one police station.There are many face-to-face challenges in the work of litigation, as a defence attorney it is difficult to get a client’s FIR registered and not only uploaded online but it is difficult to go to the police station and get an FIR, how can we possibly argue without an FIR! The widespread identification of these communities has led to the permanent supply of clients to lawyers. There are networks of attorneys; and a false guarantee of bail. This is also a shortage of quality lawyers because in many cases lawyers themselves are convinced of the crimes of these communities. Although it has long been accepted for bail by a High Court, it is granted only on bail. Personal obligations are probably confusing to many in the system and as a result are rarely used. The NCRB, or CCP does not store data in a separate format. Relying heavily on the three broad levels of SC management. Lack of relevant data leaves many communities unheard and hinders the use of data for litigation purposes. Service attorneys are paid a small amount, are given very little training or no training at all which harms their performance. The case cannot be continued until the defendant has attorneys, but this right is mechanically treated with little or no consideration at all by the right of assistance by the practicing attorney.Criminal Justice and Police Accountability Project:The Criminal Justice and Police Accountability Project is an intervention that focuses on criminalizing certain communities through the police and the criminal justice system and border controls. The project is a low-level intervention based in Bhopal, operating locally, and in specific communities in the Madhya Pradesh region. These communities include those that were formerly criminalized in colonial law, now classified as Denotified Tribal (DNT) communities and other communities that are equally persecuted and discriminated against by the justice system. The purpose of the intervention is to make the justice system respond to and suppress the transformation of its elements, including legislative, police and administrative systems, and to challenge unfair laws that persecute and discriminate against DNT members and other target communities. It seeks to do this by ensuring quality legal representation for people from these communities at various forums through effective legal strategies, case studies, and access to higher courts. Case work will be done in conjunction with research aimed at understanding how social governance in these communities is maintained by administrative and judicial practices, and then challenging itself and the courts.While working they encounter criminal cases from Pardi, Gond and other similar target communities. Provisions of criminal law related to theft, burglary, docket, possession of weapons and alcohol, etc. It is often used to persecute them. Currently, there is a wide gap between the level and quality of legal representation provided to communities. The task of the defendant will be to focus on two main issues namely pre-trial and court proceedings. Pre-trial work will involve the provision of legal representation from the time of detention. Pre-trial work will include challenging false detention, illegal detention in police cells, provision for traffickers, etc. It will be done in accordance with this research work. Incorporating this study at the start of the trial and trial phase to emphasize how common the system is to identify DNT communities in a cohesive manner.SC on prison overcrowding:The Supreme Court granted a detailed order for the strong currents in the second strong Covid-19 wave, saying police should not arrest suspects unless necessary in cases sentenced to less than seven years in prison, and ordered authorities to ensure hospitals were provided with appropriate treatment facilities. Strong committees made up of national governments and Union territories have been asked to identify and release sensitive categories of prisoners as soon as possible. The Supreme Court also ordered that prisoners granted amnesty last year be re-granted a 90-day to deal with the epidemic. The court ruled those measures should be taken to control the spread of Covid-19 by conducting regular examinations of prisoners and prison staff and immediate medical attention should be obtained from them. “It is necessary to maintain daily hygiene and sanitation that need to be improved. Appropriate measures will be taken to prevent the transmission of the deadly virus among prison inmates,” the order said. The court noted that some inmates may refuse to be released because of their social background and fear of infection. “In rare cases like these, the authorities are instructed to consider the problems facing prisoners,” The May 12 ruling of the SC urges the courts to actively use the option of house arrest in cases where “age, health conditions and opposition of the defendant” are the norm. The court has expressed grave concern over the overcrowding of prisons on average at least 118 percent above the limit and the rising costs of operations.Conclusion:Home detention as a punishment is viewed differently depending on the social and political environment. Even prison sentences have been used in various ways by the colonial powers and elected governments of India depending on the social class and the political organizations of the prisoner. Even if they are confined to their home, there will always be some who believe that their imprisonment is very comfortable and that others find it very humiliating. Given the context of the extreme condition of the Indian prison and the lack of political will in proper monitoring, the option of house arrest should be considered a good opportunity. Familiarity with the subcontractor or his or her place of residence and the ability to get immediate medical attention should wrap the courts in the use and use of this as an option.References:[Surbhi karwa & Rajesh Ranjan], [On Policing In Pandemic, Mindless Arrests & Prison Overcrowding : Interview Criminal Justice & Police Accountability Project], [Live Law], [1st page], 2021[Teesta Setalvad], [The pandemic has put the spotlight on inhumane conditions in Indian prisons], [Indian Express], [2021][The Hindu] [Protecting prisoners: On overcrowding of prisons], [The Hindu], [2021]This article is edited by Anamika Singh.

    "data": " This Article has been written by RASHI SHARMA from AJEENKYA D.Y PATIL UNIVERSITY , PUNE.WHAT IS THE COLLEGIUM SYSTEM?A Collegium System is a system under the Judiciary of India which deals with the arrangement, advancement, and move of the judges of the Supreme Court of India, by a discussion that comprises the Chief justice of India and four of the senior-most judges of the supreme court.There is no such notice of the collegium which has been given in the Constitution of India or some other revisions of the constitution. In any case, the constitution discusses the arrangement of judges under Article 124 (2) which states ” that the Judges of the Supreme Court are selected by the President after counsel with a particular number of the Judges of the Supreme Court and of the High Courts in the States as the President may consider significant for the reason.” and under Article 217 which states ” that the Judge of a High Court will be designated by the President meeting with the Chief Justice of India, the Governor of the State, and, on account of the arrangement of a Judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of the High Court.” THE EVOLUTION OF COLLEGIUM SYSTEMThe collegium system finally came into effect after three major cases that are considered to be a landmark in the evolution of the collegium.1. S.P Gupta vs. Union of India & Ors. (1981) – Also known as the First Judges Case of 1981, this case was a seven-judge constitution bench that held that the judge can be transferred against his will. It started with an Article 124 (2) which envisaged a just consultation and said that the consultation shall be complete, meaning that it should neither be more or less which can signify that the Chief Justice shall be provided with all the factual inputs to enable him to form an opinion. All the communications made to him shall be in writing. The reason behind this judgment was that the ultimate authority cannot be vested with the Judiciary as the Judiciary is not accountable to anyone thereby giving supremacy to the Executive over the judiciary2. The Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association(SCARA) vs. Union of India (1993) – Also known as the Second Judges Case of 1993, this case was a nine-judge Constitution bench which overruled the decision of S.P Gupta and appointed a specific procedure called the ” collegium system” for the appointment and transfer of judges in the higher judiciary. This case observed the primacy to the Chief Justice Of India, in the matters of appointment and transfers while also ruling that the term “consultation” would not diminish the primary role of the CJI in judicial appointments.3. Re: Under Article 143(1) Of The Constitution of India vs Unknown (1998) – Also Known as the Third Judges Case of 1998, this case was a nine-judge constitution bench that talked about the re-appointment of the Judges. Under this judgment, the Collegium System was widened. Under this judgment, the Supreme Court had impacted and widened the scope of judicial primacy in the appointment of judges. The judgment laid that the opinion of the Chief Justice was important, but he would concern 4 of the senior-most judges of the Supreme Court, thereby forming a collegium. The collegium system was not structurally rigid but functional. It was also said that for the appointment of the High Court judges, the Chief Justice of that High Court along with 2 of the senior-most judges of that High Court shall be consulted.. LIMITATIONS OF THE COLLEGIUM SYSTEMWhen Judges appoint Judges, the essence of democracy is endangered.Had the Constitution makers found the merits in this system, they would have expressed it in the Constitution. But the collegium is a concept that has evolved from the judiciary to the judiciary itself.Law Commission’s Report iterates that the Collegium System is an organization inflicted with rampant nepotism and personal patronage. That favor is done in exchange for a favor and inevitably, a judge’s son ends up becoming a judgeRECENT LANDMARK JUDGEMENTS ADDRESSING THE CONCERNTo counter these condemnations, the Supreme Court has maintained a Delhi High Court Judgment in Central Public Information Officer, Supreme Court of India v. Subhash Chandra Agarwal, wherein the CJI’s office has proclaimed a public authority under the RTI act. The CJI’s office has likewise been supposed to be equivalent to the workplace of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court said that the Transparency doesn’t sabotage Judicial Independence, as Judicial freedom and responsibility go inseparably. At present , the worries and restrictions regarding untouchable legal executive has shifted to a degree that public interest tests and security tests must be embraced in giving the subtleties of the ‘contributions’, as described by Justice Khanna.While the data may be unveiled after plenty of variables, this judgment places the Supreme Court office in the public eye.This special situation of law is just found in India whereas in UK, known as the mother of majority rules system the Judicial Appointments Commission (JAC) , an Independent Commission takes care of the interaction of choice of contender for legal office in Courts and Tribunal, comprising the sum of 15 individuals, out of which 3 individuals will be from Judges Community, and the remaining 12 individuals (counting Chairmen) are designated through open rivalry. Other than JAC there is another authority known as “Legal Appointments Conduct and ombudsman” to investigate the Complaints concerning arrangements by JAC and Judicial discipline or Conduct.In South Africa, which follows the steps of individuals such as Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela, in which the President assigns the Judges in the wake of counseling the “Legal Services Commission” comprising 23 individuals including Judges, Advocates, Legal Professors, individuals from Parliament, and famous people designated by the president as its individuals. The individuals from the panels will keep during the joy of the parliament.In Italy which is one of the old majestic states, the Federal Constitutional Court is their highest court, which comprises a sum of 15 individuals. Out of the 15 judges, 1/third will be designated by the President of the nation, 1/third by the parliament in a joint meeting, and 1/third by highest case customary and regulatory courts. Every one of the legal authorities in other conspicuous nations appears to be encompassed by the Executive’s impedance. In India, it appears to be that the issue with the arrangement of judges is simply the current judges. The parliament of India felt that the collegium system needed responsibility and straightforwardness, as such through the 99th amendment to the Indian constitution brought NJAC (National legal arrangements commission) in the year August 2014.Mr. Justice M.N. Venkatachaliah, who headed the National Commission to audit the working of the Constitution, had likewise suggested a five-Member National Judicial Commission, whereby, a wide consultative interaction was tried to be presented, in the determination and arrangement of Judges.Justice V.R. Krishna Ayer while composing advances to “Story of a Chief Justice” communicated the collegium neglected to choose the best-appointed authority’s accessible, comparable view communicated by Justice Rumal Paul, Justice S.S. Lodhi, and Sir Nariman. Justice Varma who headed the seat of 9 judges which propounded the prevalently realized Second adjudicator Case likewise changed his view and communicated that the time has come to audit the Collegium System.NJAC Case – Supreme Court Advocates on Records Association v. Association of IndiaThe previously mentioned NJAC’s constitutionality came into question and held that the NJAC was unconstitutional. The major part was that the issue of arrangement has a direct nexus with the autonomy of the legal executive conceived in Article 50 and all through the constitutional history and working of the Republic of India.The autonomy of the legal executive and division of forces were held to be the two significant reasons by J. Kehar with regards to why the NJAC was struck down. J. Kurian Joseph agreed and held the view that ‘things ought not to be increased except if important’ – Entia Non-Sunt Multiplicanda Sine Necessitate.The disagreeing perspective on J. Chelameswar doesn’t consider the 99th Constitutional Amendment Act as violative of the constitution, as it doesn’t contribute total forces to the president to name or move judges. Moreover, the NJAC guarantees that no disgraceful up-and-comer will be designated up to 2 individuals from the commission to see that the applicant is bumbling. He also added that the presence of the association law doesn’t in any capacity subvert the authenticity and the freedom of the legal executive, however his rejection would seriously sabotage the say of a popularity-based government picked by individuals and would be ruinous to the fundamental element of governing rules.. CONCLUSIONRegardless of whether the circumstance works after the RTI – CJI judgment, yet is apparent that there is no responsibility in the arrangement of judges. Individuals who run the arrangements are dispossessed of appropriate obligations and responsibilities. The legal executive has not just fizzled in the execution of the collegium framework yet isn’t even blameable for it. The Union Government, then again, is by all accounts running point at present and the obstruction is back. The Indian Constitution is enduring and anticipating quick consideration "

    "data": "This article is written by Aryan Singh from Symbiosis Law School, NagpurIntroduction-What is the Legal Definition of Blackmail?The crime of taking efforts to conceal injuring numerous people until money or any other advantage is gained is known as coercion. Sometimes, the wrongdoer looks for favours other than cash, such as sexual blessings or various edges to take control over their situation.Shakedown happens once someone takes steps to uncover dangerous data except if they are paid in be that as it may. Note that the wrongdoing happens once the danger is made – no money or property has to move. On the off chance that someone extorts you, they are violating the law either way.The computerized drawIndia has been a proficient associate in having an upsurge in episodes of crime and sextortion that means successfully coercing for sexual benefit, all through the last decade. Sextortion can sometimes take the form of a fleeing United Nations official approaching a victim’s film or pictures. The victims’ territory is coerced for money, sexual favours, or more compromising material, with the threat that the criminal would sell the material they have on the internet if they do not comply. When one accomplice keeps realistic material from a relationship, vengeance immorality is genuinely normal. With the worry of those realistic photographs/recordings being uncovered online, the victim is regularly constrained from seeing someone.Victims are frequently extorted through altered pictures in a way that their faces are used for sexual material. Digital following is regularly joined with sextortion. Such violations to the victim are enormously expanded by informal communication organizations and compound examination sites. Cell phone applications add to the risk since clients of video-calling applications are ignorant of the fact that they are being recorded. The telephone applications that record WhatsApp sounds and video calls, applications that approach any or all or any of the substance in one’s telephone display (like games, photograph altering applications, and interpersonal social applications), and frameworks for wiped out data from the respective phones. One among the premier normal reasons people become victims could likewise be a shortfall of attention to such phone applications and tech-based capabilities.Arrangements identified with coercing under Indian lawBlackmailing could be a kind of criminal terrorizing, that is illustrated in Section 503 of the Indian Penal Code as “Whoever compromises another with any injury to his individual, notoriety, or property, or to the individual or name of anybody in whom that individual is intrigued, with the expectation to make alert that individual, or to preclude to do to any demonstration that that individual is by law qualified for due to, as to how of trying not to do any demonstration that that individual is by right qualified for due to, because of the implies that of trying not to do.”Criminal terrorizing could result in a sentence of one or the other type of prison, which can last if two years, or a fine, or a mix of the two.Section 384 can also be applied to depict it: Extortion is deserving of detainment of any sort, if three years, a fine, or both. The punishment is 3 years under this arrangement, and accordingly, the offence is non-bailable and an offence by any law authority.The victim has the authority under Section 108(1)(i)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code to contact the legal advisor in her area and inform him/her about the person she believes of appropriating any repulsive material. The lawyer has the authority to imprison such people and require them to sign a promise prohibiting them from distributing the information. This might be a problem for the respondent. Typically, this is a quick review area since the victim can file a complaint with legal counsel without providing any serious proof against the litigant.An individual United Nations organization is prosecuted under Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code if they disseminate or take efforts to reveal any personal and compromising images of someone by any electronic means, including apps and various web-based media (IPC).A paraphilia case under Section 354C of the IPC can be made with the assistance of various application areas from The Information Technology Act if a sexual photo of a woman is taken and circulated without her information.Various laws administer sexual maltreatment:The Protection Of Women From Brutality Act, 2005: This law was authorized to create a response for women tortured by domestic violence.The Sexual Harassment Of Women At Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013: This act protects women against harassment in the work environment.Section 354 (A to D) of the Indian Codification 1860: Sets down punishments for various sorts of sexual offences.Section 376(2) talks concerning assault given the maltreatment of professionals in explicit circumstances.Section 108(1)(i)(a) of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 has been amended to provide the victim with the capacity to contact the law expert and document a complaint to the legal scholar concerning the movement of indecent material.The Protection of Children From Sexual Offenses Act, 2012: It is intended to handle issues related to sexual abuse of children.Data Technology Act, 2000 conjointly cover certain sexual offences and some digital crimes.Section 66E of the IT Act, 2000 – Violation of Privacy – restricts capturing of disseminative photographs of an individual without their knowledge.Section 67 of the IT Act, 2000 – Sending repulsive electronic material – Sharing pictures or recordings to defame someone is culpable.Section 67B of the IT Act, 2000 – Child immorality applies – If the victim is a minor, under eighteen years.Section 67A of the IT Act, 2000 – Electronic material containing physically explicit substance in possession due to cover up cameras to record and share videos could also be a liable offence.Instructions to affect shakedown.The absolute first thing to stay at the top of the priority list is that you should never assume control over issues. On the off chance that you choose to use your dangers, you may certainly be quiet and subsequently, the offender would have the option to play out their danger. Likewise, just complying with the criminal will result in additional requests or even releasing the content to the public in a spur.The police unit is entrusted with finding these criminals. Choose them first. Coercion and extortion is a serious crime, and it is their duty to consent to the law. The dangers might be more severe than you may believe.Follow the social control headings, although they appear ridiculous. They will have you go through another round of a shakedown on behalf of your abuser to get enough evidence to condemn you. They may also counsel you to refuse the criminal or come up with other strategies to encourage them to go. Take the suggestion, no matter what it is. The police region unit has prepared specialists from the United Nations office to deal with these situations and to determine what verification will be required to ensure that your criminal will never brutalize you or anyone else again.To be honest, contacting your professional individual for assistance in dealing with these perplexing legal difficulties is sometimes the only option. A competent legal expert cannot only assist you in gaining perspective while ensuring your security, as proven above, but the individual can also assist you in figuring out the best way to get work with on the edge of your issue. They may even suggest options that you would not have explored otherwise.What should you do?In case you are being harassed via web-based applications, do not put up with it and keep quiet. If all else is equal, you should fight the criminal right from the start.If you are a survivor of digital harassment, you must be compelled to report it to the local police. It is recommended that before reporting it to the cops, talk with an expert individual and gain reasonable evidence on the criminal. This can help you construct a more grounded case. You would probably have the option to prevent the criminal from coercing others by reporting it.Survivors of digital shakedown can likewise report the offence at www.cybercrime.gov.in. The Ministry of Home Affairs has place up this committed site for reporting the crime. The victim should create an acquaintance in the account by giving his name to record a complaint on this site. The victim can follow up the case online.If you have been the victim of any kind, don’t take away the perpetrator’s pictures, emails, or alternative material as a result of doing this makes it troublesome to trace down-proof among the virtual worlds.ConclusionTo ensure that everyone will report law-breaking honestly and completely, the framework should be a safe and private method for receiving and registering complaints, guaranteeing that the complaint is investigated with safety. More fundamentally, legitimate, institutional (inappropriate behaviour advisory groups at colleges and schools) and local security components (such as NGOs) for these victims should be established, as well as legal and mental support to encourage victims to come forward and hold perpetrators accountable. Furthermore, the government should identify comprehensive measures to curb the rising rates of cybercrime in India. The government should place a premium on the security of the name and the safety of the persons in the issue.References-What can I do if someone is blackmailing me onlinehttps://www.minclaw.com/5-tips-combat-online-extortion-sextortion-blackmail/https://www.mondaq.com/india/crime/989624/anti-cyber-bullying-laws-in-india–ananalysis "

    "data": "This article is written by- Surbhi Kumari from Amity University Patna.IntroductionEver since the appearance of the time of the web, a brand new question has begun to emerge with relation to the thought of net access as a right. Folks have begun to advocate their voices regarding the importance of this as a right. With relation to the recent pandemic, the web has become the medium of labour and therefore the supply of each essential factor, together with the courts. With the fast evolution of technology and therefore the net enjoying an important role.In 2016, the UN declared access to the web as a basic right. Since the eruption of COVID-19, net services have provided the comfort of performing from home to billions of individuals. Whereas virtual courts have emerged as an answer to render justice in times of the pandemic, there arises a retardance with relation to the accessibility of net services and an information measure of network which will change and guarantee sleek functioning.The Covid-19 pandemic has non-continuous court operations across the country, prompting judges to set back nonessential proceedings and conduct others through video or phone. When courts have begun to open up, several also are continuing or testing new ways in which to expand the employment of remote technology. At identical times, public health considerations square measure leading some legal services suppliers and alternative advocates to oppose the come back to in-person proceedings. On the far side of the present moment, many court leaders have jointly suggested that distended use of remote technology ought to become a permanent feature of our justice system.Reason of Virtual courtThe unfolding of Coronavirus and therefore the nationwide internment has prompted the Supreme Court and varied High Courts to conduct judicial proceedings on-line. The Supreme Court has taken measures to ensure continuity of administration of justice throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. IT infrastructure is being put in to help the proceedings that may present itself within the virtual presence of the shoppers and their legal representatives. While the requirement of the hour needs such steps to be taken, it’s imperative that free and honest administration of justice isn’t non continuous.The advantages of virtual court for lawyers and litigants• It is simpler for everybody to schedule a particular time for a hearing. There’s less waiting around for alternative cases to end. If a decision has to be schedule or set back a hearing, everybody will wait within the comfort of their home.• There isn’t any ought to travel. This protects on travel expenses and time. There’s no ought to reserve an area within the courthouse or associate degree workplace. There’s conjointly less to worry regarding security, parking, lines, and alternative inconveniences.• Introducing exhibits. Generally, with group discussion, the lawyers ought to have all their exhibits ready (in advance of the hearing/meeting) in order that they are sent to the decide for review and to opposing counsel.• Reduce the employment of police.• Cost effective.Disadvantages of virtual court for lawyers and litigants• Control problems. It should be harder to decide to manage a virtual court than a physical court. Judges can’t see what’s occurring behind the scenes of the lense.•While most court proceedings are open to the public, lawsuits without a jury might often involve just the decision, the shoppers, and consequently the lawyers. However once you’re on-line employing a service like Zoom, children, relatives, and anyone with a countersign will watch. This is often particularly vital once it involves sequestering witnesses.In a physically demanding court, the ruling will direct the witnesses to remain outside the courtroom until it is time to testify. When you’re conducting judicial proceedings, it’s easier to enforce the principles.• Many personal records together with psychological evaluations, medical reports, and alternative info square measure are introduced in trials and alternative court hearings. There’s a larger risk that this info is hacked once you’re in an exceedingly video conference. There might also be problems involving the privacy and security of medical records thanks to the insurance movability and answer ableness Act.The effects of virtual court on witness credibilityOne surprising result of video court is witness quality. It’s exhausting to elucidate however vital it’s to examine a witness head to head and to look at how that witness reacts underneath questioning. A classic means of observing the quality of a witness is to look at their hands. In an exceedingly physical court, the judge will see the hand. In an exceedingly virtual court, the judge can’t see a witness’s hands. Very little things like this will create it more durable to work out if a witness is credible. There is conjointly a true risk of witness change of state. In an exceedingly virtual court setting, it is exhausting to inform if a witness is being coached through text messages or another dishonest technique. Due to COVID-19, the community is exploiting teleconferences and remote hearings through programs like Zoom so personal injury cases will proceed to a settlement or trial.Challenges to Adopting Virtual CourtsThe question of accessMost virtual court proceedings in India presently present themselves exploiting third party software/platforms that create a security hazard and square measure liable to hacking and misuse. It should be built as an Associate degree proprietary software system for India’s judiciary to use and handle virtual court sessions.The degree of comfort:An extremely underrated equally eventful issue is whether or not everybody, even though access to reliable net property is universal, is snug and well versed with the new tools and mediums of justice delivery. It’s fascinating that the Secretary, Department of Justice declared that massive, well-fixed law corporations and advocates in urban areas would face no problems as compared to those participants in rural areas given the digital divide The idea of open courts:On this, representatives of the bar visited the extent of stating that virtual courts “threaten the constitutionality of Court proceedings and undermine the importance of Rule of law that forms a neighbourhood of the fundamental structure of the Constitution.”• In the case of Naresh Shridhar Mirajkar and Ors. v. State of maharashtra and Ors,The Supreme Court expressed “… Public trial in open Court is doubtless essential for the healthy, objective and truthful administration of justice. Trial control subject to the general public scrutiny and gaze naturally acts as a check against judicial desire or vagaries and is a robust instrument for making confidence of the general public within the fairness, judgment, and non-partisanship of the administration of justice.” Litigants and advocates lack web property and requisite infrastructure and suggest that to participate in virtual hearings. The National Broadband Mission must be pursued quickly in order to provide dependable property to district and lower courts.4. Privacy and data security are two issues that need to be addressed. The majority of virtual court proceedings in Bharat now employ third-party software packages or platforms, and many of them have already been banned because they are risky to use. Third-party platforms create a security hazard and are at risk of hacking and misuse. It was advised that the Ministries of Law and Justice and IT develop new software packages for India’s judiciary to use and to handle virtual court hearings. Current state of affairs Delhi tribunal, being the foremost advanced tribunal within the country in terms of technology, had already started victimisation associated with the E-filing system even before the pandemic. They’d come upon varied locations within the court so the lawyers get an inspiration of how the e-filing centres work. It consists of the signature of the lawyer/judge and e-filing is completed at specific e-filing centres. Ten courts of the urban center tribunal already used an associated electronic system of proceedings and since the condition of the COVID-19 pandemic is way from over, still following an equivalent system and are conducting the proceedings smoothingly.ConclusionThough video conferencing technology has been a valuable tool throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, existing scholarship suggests reasons to take care regarding the growth or long adoption of remote court proceedings. Additional analysis is critical, each regarding the potential impact of remote technology on outcomes during a numerous variety of cases, moreover because of the benefits and drawbacks with regard to access to justice. Meanwhile, as courts develop policies for remote proceedings, they ought to sit down with a broad set of stakeholders, as well as public defenders and prosecutors, legal services suppliers, victim and incapacity advocates, community leaders, and legal students.

    "headline": "DO HAND SANITIZERS REQUIRE A LICENSE TO BE SOLD IN STORES?Changes after the Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35AIMPORTANCE OF MEDICLAIM POLICYJUSTICE FOR TANISH NARANG : BVP PUNE’S LAW STUDENT BEATEN TO DEATH",
    "data": "This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida.BACKGROUNDSanitization of hands is a trite official advice that has been repeated over time and again during the Covid-19 havoc that has resulted in a global tragedy. Hand sanitizers, which come in liquid, gel, or foam form, are chemicals that are applied to the hands to kill common germs. When the world saw an outbreak of clusters of pneumonia cases, later identified as the Coronavirus, resulting in a large number of deaths, governments, in consultation with their respective health departments and the WHO (World Health Organization), formalized a series of guidelines, primarily emphasizing the importance of personal hygiene and social distancing by the general public. Hand health is unquestionably important in preventing the spread of the infection. When hands are not noticeably dirty, the WHO recommends applying an alcohol-based hand rub for 20-30 seconds, using the right techniques.STEPS TAKEN BY AUTHORITIESSeveral governments throughout the world had recommended the use of ethyl alcohol or isopropyl alcohol-based hand rubs for hand hygiene in accordance with these standards. The WHO’s approval and government recommendations for alcohol-based hand sanitizers have clearly resulted in a surge in public demand in India and around the world. In response to the disconcerting increase in demand for hand sanitizers across the country, the Drug Licensing Authorities granted permission to manufacture these items in a record time of three days, not only to drug manufacturers, but also, strangely, to alcohol breweries and cosmetic manufacturers, all in an effort to alleviate the product’s shortage caused by an unexpected surge in demand. As a result, under the Essential Commodities Act of 1955, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food and Public Distribution designated hand sanitizers as an “essential commodity” in March, 2020. Hand sanitizers were exempted from the requirement of a sale license under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940, and the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945, by the Union Health Ministry in May, 2020. Several requests were submitted to the government, according to the official notification, to exempt hand sanitizers from the requirement of a sale license under the Drugs and Cosmetics Act. It has now been deduced from a number of circulars and instructions issued by Drug Inspectors across the country that the sale of hand sanitizers will be limited to dealers with drug licenses, limiting its sale to medical shops and chemists. This would have a significant impact on the supply and availability of such a vital item, especially when the urgent requirement is to ensure that sanitizers are available in every state, village, and town.LEGISLATIVE PROVISIONSDrugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940 & Drugs and Cosmetics Rule, 1945The Drugs and Cosmetics Act of 1940 codifies the laws governing the manufacture, import, distribution, and sale of drugs and cosmetics. The manufacture, sale, and distribution of pharmaceuticals and cosmetics are covered in Chapter IV of the statute. According to Section 18(c) of the Act, no person, acting individually or on behalf of another, may manufacture any medication or cosmetic for sale, stock, distribution, or exhibition unless a license has been given for the purpose. When combined with the Rules, the Act mandates that every drug stocked or supplied in India be done so with a license. However, it is worth noting that the Rules explicitly provide for exemptions from the application of certain Act requirements to specific types of drugs.In its wisdom, the legislature decided that certain items should be excused from the rigors of drug licensing under the Act for the purpose of stocking and selling. Insecticides are defined as compounds designed to be used for the extermination of vermin or insects that cause disease in humans or animals, according to entry 12 of Schedule K of the Rules. Disinfectants have an exception that allows them to be stocked and sold without the need for a drug license. It is worth noting, however, that such an exception is not uncommon. Several other medications, such as Oral Rehydration Salts, medicated dressings, and comparable treatments, currently have such exemptions. To include all chemical agents that destroy or impede the growth of pathogenic microorganisms, the term “disinfectants” had to be given a broader definition. Several items, including antiseptic lotions and sanitizers, will be included in a larger and more objective definition of disinfectants. Sanitizer has now received a global recognition as a disinfectant.RELEVANT CASE LAWSIn Reckitt Benckiser v. State of Kerala, the Kerala High Court reviewed and recognized the disinfecting characteristics of specific formulations of antiseptic liquids containing alcohol, and approved their capacity to avoid the medication stocking and sale licensing requirements that disinfectants face. The court was summoned to determine whether or not ‘Dettol’ was a disinfectant, absolving it from Section 18 of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Dettol’s ability to be used for pre-operative skin preparation, antisepsis in midwifery, or on external lacerations such as cuts, stings, bites, and scratches for the same objective of eliminating microorganisms does not make it anything less than a disinfectant.In the matter of Vijayakumar and Others v. Drug Inspector, the Andhra Pradesh High Court concluded that Savlon is a disinfectant for the purposes of the Act. It had been assumed that disinfectants were chemicals or mixtures of chemicals in appropriate quantities for destroying or rendering germs inactive.GOVERNMENT NOTIFICATION DATED 27.07.2020Every drug kept and sold in India must have a drug license, as per the provisions of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. Hand sanitizer could formerly only be sold by licensed pharmacists and druggists. Hand sanitizers are not excluded from this rule. As a result, the entire supply chain for hand sanitizers, including shops, is required to sell them under the DCA’s stock and sale license. Mandatory licensing for selling and stocking hand sanitizers was waived by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare on 27th July, 2020. Traders had approached the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, seeking inclusion of hand sanitizers in Schedule K of the Drugs and Cosmetic Rules, 1945. The Centre was satisfied that hand sanitizers are an essential item in COVID, according to the directive.The term “hand sanitizers” shall be included in the column “Class of Drugs” of Schedule K of the Drugs and Cosmetics, Rules, 1945, as per Section 26-B of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940. In India, hand sanitizers are more relevant and in demand than they have ever been. Manufacturers and marketers of hand sanitizers, on the other hand, must adhere to all applicable laws and regulations.REFERENCESS.O. 2451(E) – Exemption of hand sanitizer from sale license-Section 26B https://cdsco.gov.in/opencms/opencms/system/modules/CDSCO.WEB/elements/download_file_division.jsp?num_id=NjMzMA==Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940Drugs and Cosmetics Rule, 1945Reckitt Benckiser v.

    "headline": "RESIDUAL DOUBT THEORY: AN ADDITION TO INDIAN CAPITAL SENTENCE JURISPRUDENCETOP 10 WEBSITES FOR LAW SCHOOL ASSIGNMENTSBreaking News: SC upholds death sentence for Nirbhaya case convictsIndia Ratifies Two ILO Conventions On International Day Against Child Labor",
    "data": "This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida.“One of the most fearful aspects of death penalty is its finality…. The belief that such an ultimate and final penalty is inappropriate where there are doubts as to guilt, even if they do not rise to the level necessary for acquittal, is a feeling that stems from common sense and fundamental notions of justice.” -Justice Thurgood Marshall (1984) When there is a residual question about a capital murderer’s innocence, the thought of executing the worst of penalties is morally and socially abhorrent, according to Justice Marshall’s statement. In fact, residual doubt may be the most powerful mitigating element a jury can consider when deciding on the right sentencing for a capital offender. In circumstances of capital punishment, residual doubt is a mitigating element. It is a state of mind that sits halfway between ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘absolute certainty.’ It is not a fact about the defendant or the circumstances of the crime, but a lingering question about facts. Despite being recognised as a mitigating element in death sentencing, ‘residual doubt,’ a notion born in America, has been mired in factual uncertainty— a state of mind that hovers somewhere in between ‘beyond reasonable doubt’ and ‘absolute certainty.’ RESIDUAL DOUBT THEORY The term ‘residual doubt’ refers to any remaining or lingering uncertainty a jury has about the defendant’s guilt after being convinced ‘beyond a reasonable doubt.’ The doctrine of ‘residual doubt’ entered Indian criminal law in 2014, however its origin dates back to 1984 in the United States of America. In Lockett v. Ohio (438 U.S. 586, 604 1978), the United States Supreme Court construed the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to allow a sentencer to consider “any of the circumstances of the offence that the defendant proffers as a reason for a sentence less than death.” Reasonable doubt is a legitimate doubt based on reason and common sense, not a fictitious, trifling, or trivial doubt. Although residual doubt is not relevant for conviction, it is relevant at the stage of sentencing when the death penalty is being considered to determine whether the case falls into the rarest of rare’ category. This idea establishes a higher threshold of proof than the ‘beyond a reasonable doubt’ level employed at the time of conviction as a protection against routine capital punishment, taking into account the irreversibility of death. PSYCHOLOGY’S ROLE The persuasive power of various types of residual doubt evidence can be determined through empirical study. By studying the effects of different types of residual doubt evidence in the penalty phases of capital murder cases, researchers could bring valuable empirical evidence to light on this topic. With the right facts, research psychologists could educate policymakers about this crucial topic and play a key role in capital murder sentencing policy. AMERICAN JURISPRUDENCE The contemporary period of capital punishment in the United States began a little over two decades ago, when the Supreme Court approved six states’ new capital statutory regimes, four years after striking down death penalty statutes. The Court’s attempt to construct a rational, consistent, and nonarbitrary mechanism for imposing capital punishment began with this decision. The American Supreme Court ruled in Franklin vs. Lynaugh in 1988 that ‘residual doubt’ was not a constituent of the Eighth Amendment and hence did not justify a necessary jury instruction to consider it. This erosion of its mandatory applicability was further exemplified in Oregon vs. Guzek, a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States of America was debating the admissibility of additional evidence at the sentencing stage. The Supreme Court clarified how ‘reasonable doubt’ and ‘residual doubt’ are applied during sentencing and clarified that sentencing is concerned with ‘how’ rather than ‘if’ a person committed a crime. The Supreme Court of the United States of America’s distinction between Eighth Amendment rights and residual doubt has tipped the scales against its mandatory implementation. INDIAN JURISPRUDENCE Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab (1980), a landmark Supreme Court decision, heralded the beginning of constitutional administration of the death penalty. The court used the notion of ‘rarest of rare’ to show that Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 follows due process, holding that life imprisonment is the rule and death sentence is the exception. In Indian capital punishment law, residual doubt has received little consideration. Courts have held the quality of evidence for passing the irreversible sentence of death to a higher standard than that which controls conviction, finding it hazardous to award the death penalty for convictions based on the nature of the circumstantial evidence on record on multiple occasions. The Supreme Court first used the residual doubt theory in the case of Ashok Debbarma v. State of Tripura ruling that a decision-maker’s mind can hang between reasonable doubt and absolute conviction, resulting in lingering uncertainty. The death penalty was mitigated to life in prison with a minimum term of twenty years, based on the fact that while the evidence showed guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, it was unclear if the offence was committed exclusively by the accused. According to Krishnan and Another. v. State of Kerala, reasonable doubt is a fair doubt founded on reason and common sense, not an imaginary, insignificant, or mere possible uncertainty. Although residual doubt is not relevant for conviction, it is relevant at the stage of sentencing when the death penalty is being considered to determine whether the case falls into the ‘rarest of rare’ category. Sudam Alias Rahul Kumar Kaniram Jadhav v. State of Maharashtra, where the death sentence was remitted to life imprisonment based on the circumstantial character of the evidence, was another instance where this theory was applied. The Supreme Court recently reaffirmed its decision in Ashok Debbarma v. State of Tripura in Ravishankar v. State of Madhya Pradesh stating that although the residual doubts are not important for conviction, they would tilt towards mitigating the circumstances while deciding whether the case comes under the umbrella of ‘rarest of rare cases’. CONCLUSION The Supreme Court of India’s acknowledgement of ‘residual doubt’ shows the court’s determination to offer protections against capital punishment. Despite the fact that it is impossible to formulate a clear policy for the imposition of death sentences, it has worked to establish safeguards to protect an individual’s constitutionally protected rights in light of the inevitability of a death sentence. The principles flowing from Article 21 of the Indian Constitution are responsible for the recognition and application of “residual doubt” as a safeguard. The Court has crystallised its approach of putting the quality of evidence to a higher bar for issuing a death sentence than for passing a conviction by recognising the principle of ‘residual doubt’ and explaining its applicability.

    "data": " This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida. INTRODUCTIONWe have all heard of Spiderman, Archibald, Phineas & Ferb, Donald Duck, Tom & Jerry, Oswald, Doraemon and other internationally known cartoon characters, as well as our own local indigenously created fictitious characters like Chota Bheem and Jaggu, Tenali Raman, Suppandi, Kalia the Crow, Mowgli, Motu Patlu and others. Graphic characters and fictional characters are the two types of characters that can be distinguished. A graphic character can be represented by a cartoon or other graphic image. Readers can see the physical look and characterization of the characters. A fictitious figure, on the other hand, is a word picture whose physical form and characterization are created in the reader’s mind. Reading about a character through the pages of a book, rather than just a single paragraph or sentence, inspires such imagination. As a result, the reader has no concrete physical sense of who the character is. Because the courts have provided varying levels of protection by laying down distinct tests to evaluate if a character can be granted copyright protection, it is necessary to distinguish them and deal with them independently.EXPLOITATION OF CARTOON CHARACTERSCharacters may easily transition from one medium to another and even take on new dimensions. For instance, a cartoon character who first appeared in a comic book and then became popular may be widely commercialized in conjunction with a wide range of products and services, resulting in numerous revenue-generating opportunities as can be seen with the Avenger series. Online clothing apparel, packaging items, school bags, lunch boxes, footballs, hand wash, etc.- almost everything today is advertised with the cartoon character as the brand ambassador to lure the attention of the masses.PROTECTION OF GRAPHIC CARTOON CHARACTERSAs an ‘artistic work,’ a graphic character cannot be granted copyright protection (artistic work includes a drawing, painting, photograph, sculpture, and so on) Courts have been more indulgent in preserving characters with tangible visual characteristics than in defending literary characters whose image is completely based on human mental abstractions. The copyright law can only preserve the creature’s visual expression as shown in drawings, but its character and personality develop over time as the creator creates new episodes. Because it can only be understood by the human mind, it lacks visual expression. As a result, the character’s moods and personalities are not protected under copyright law as ‘artistic work’.PROTECTION OF FICTIONAL CARTOON CHARACTERSDavid B Feldman simply wrote:“A fictional character has three identifiable and legally significant components: its name, its physical or visual appearance, and its physical attributes and personality traits or “Characterization.”In terms of intellectual property, a literary work is entitled to protection. It’s unclear if this protection should be extended to the work’s fictional characters in addition to the work itself. If protection is granted, even a unique literary work would be prohibited from using the same character in its plot.PROTECTION UNDER INDIAN LAWSCopyright Act, 1957Only original literary, artistic, musical, dramatic works, sound recordings, and cinematographic films are protected under Section 13 of the Copyright Act of 1957. Because the Act only protects an original work, not a concept, a cartoon character cannot automatically be protected as an ‘artistic creation.’ In India, copyright registration is not required for the enforcement of rights. If the work was made in India, however, copyright registration is encouraged because it provides proof of ownership for rights enforcement. In addition, if the work was created in a country other than India that is a signatory to the Berne Convention or the Universal Copyright Convention, the registration of copyright in any of these countries will help establish ownership of copyright works.Trademark Act, 1999Section 2 of this Act provides protection to cartoon characters, logos, marks etc. as a mark. While a cartoon character’s copyright would ultimately expire (60 years after the creator’s death) and pass into the public domain, a trademark does not have an expiration date and can last perpetually. In contrast to copyright protection, trademark law protects not just the cartoon character, but also the character’s name and likeness. In India, just as it is not required to register a copyright, neither is it required to register a trademark. Registration is said to be advisable as having a registration gives the owner of the mark more protection and decreases the burden of proving repute.TESTS DEVELOPED BY THE COURTSThe Federal Circuit established a two-step approach for determining copyright infringement in characters in Walt Disney vs. Air Pirates, 1979. The first stage is to compare the aesthetic similarities, followed by a comparison of the characters’ personalities. Following the “Character Delineation Test” established in Nicole vs. Universal Pictures Corporation, 1930, and the “The Story Being Told Test” established in Warner Bros. Pictures Inc. vs. Columbia Broadcasting System,1954, such infringement tests shall be employed. Based on precedents, the court established a “three-part test” for assessing whether a character in a comic book, television show, or movie picture is eligible to copyright protection in DC Comics vs. Towle, 2015.IMPORTANT INDIAN CASE LAWSThe High Court of Kerala concluded in Malayala Manorama vs. V T Thomas, 1988 that the cartoon character ‘Boban and Molly’ was conceived before Mr. Thomas started working for the publishing business, and so was not developed in the course of employment. As a result, the creator would retain ownership of the character. The copyright (ownership) would be with the publishing house if the character was created by Mr. Thomas in the course of employment or under a contract of service.In Raja Pocket Books vs. Radha Pocket Books, 1997, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court established that the principles of comparison to be used in determining the resemblance would be- an unequivocal impression that the later work seems to be a copy of the original. Similarly, the subject of visual, phonetic resemblance, and general impression of the works is likely to mislead or confuse such a man, causing him to mistake the defendant’s goods for those of the plaintiff.In Disney Enterprises Inc. & Anr. vs. Gurcharan Batra & Ors., 2006, the Delhi High Court ordered the Defendants to stop selling counterfeit school bags with the names and likenesses of the Plaintiffs’ characters- Mickey Mouse, Goofy, Pluto, and Daisy Duck, Minnie Mouse.The court held in the case of Disney Enterprises Inc. & Anr. vs. Santosh Kumar & Anr., 2011 that the degree of association between the Plaintiff and the Plaintiff’s materials is so strong that any mention of them causes a significant portion of the material public to recognise and associate them with the Plaintiffs alone. As a result, the Delhi High Court issued a permanent injunction prohibiting the Defendant from selling Plaintiff’s stationery.CONCLUSIONBased on a review of case law, it appears that courts are tolerant in awarding protection to graphic characters due to their visual influence on readers’ minds. The courts are wary when it comes to fictional characters. Only when the court is convinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the characters are well defined is protection granted. Globalization, coupled with rapid technology improvement and digitization, has contributed to the simple and quick accessibility to fictional characters around the world. As a result, numerous cases of improper use of protected characters continue to surface. As a result, it is critical for owners and designers to remain vigilant and make copyright and trademark protection a top priority for their specific characters.REFERENCESThe Copyright Act, 1957, Section 2(c)Feldman David B: Finding a Home for Fictional Characters: A Proposal for Change in Copyright Protection, 78 California Law Review, 687 (1930)Walt Disney vs. Air Pirates, 581 F.2d 751 (9th Cir. 1978): 439 U.S. 1132 (1979)Nicols vs. Universal Pictures Corporation, [45 F.2d 119 (2d Cir.1930)]Warner Bros.

    "headline": "WHAT DOES A GDP NUMBER TELL US ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ECONOMYSAVE THE SAVIOURS – Kolkata Doctors’ ProtestBlackbuck Poaching Case: Judge calls Salman ‘habitual offender’Sub-Ordinate Judiciary affected by Inexperience at Bar",
    "data": "This article is written by RITIKA SRIVASTAVA of THE ICFAI UNIVERSITY, DEHRADUN INTRODUCTIONThe term GDP stands for “Gross Domestic Product”. It is the market or absolute monetary value of all the finished goods and services manufactured within a country in a limited time period. Generally GDP is calculated on an annual basis but occasionally it is also calculated on a quarterly basis and as a measure of overall domestic production, it works as a comprehensive snapshot of a country’s economic health. The calculation of GDP encloses all the government outlays, investments, private and public consumption, paid-in construction costs, foreign balance of trade and additions to private inventories. The rate of GDP of a country increases when the absolute value of goods and services that the nation’s producers sell to other foreign countries exceeds the absolute value of foreign goods and services that nation’s consumers buy and this situation is known as Trade Surplus and vice versa. Further, it is divided into five categories: a) Nominal GDP, b) Real GDP, C) GDP per capita, d) GDP Growth Rate and e) GDP purchasing Power Parity (PPP).ROLE OF GDP IN ECONOMIC BUILDING AND BUDGETGDP indicates the economy’s health and size. It measures the absolute market value (gross) of a nation’s goods and services manufactured within a specific time. GDP tells us about the economy’s whether expanding or contracting by manufacturing more goods and services or because of less output respectively. The growth of the economy is observed very closely and always reported in percentage. It is totally based on “Real GDP” which is adjusted in order to remove the effects of expansion. It actually lets us know above how a country is functioning and its relationship to other economies all around the world. The economic growth increases with the increase in GDP. As earlier mentioned, GDP is the absolute market value of nation’s production of all the good and services and the most relevant word herein is “Value.” Value can affect in two ways:Critics of economic growth inclined to focus on: on increase in production quality.To increase the quality of produced goods and services.GDP also measures the services with the increase in health care, education and other services. In a real sense, some of the economic growth is for the betterment of the environment and decreasing our dependence on natural resources. It consists of increasing public transportation, maintaining the energy efficiency of homes and business, manufacturing fuel-efficient vehicles, cleaning the waste of industries and so on.When the government’s spending increases with a certain amount, tax with the identical amount and with the increase in both the GDP will also increase by that amount.WHAT CAUSES GDP TO INCREASE OR DECREASE?There are many factors responsible for increase and decrease in the rate of GDP. These factors consist of wages, infrastructure investment, weather or political instability, interest rate, asset prices and so on and these factors have been categorized as demand-side factors or supply-side factors.Demand-side factors include interest rate which affects the spending power of consumers. Higher interest rates can cut down the expenditure of families whereas lower interest rate decreases the monthly mortgage rate which leads to more spending of money. Wages affect GDP when it is low. The reason behind that is the money of the people cannot stretch far because of high inflation periods, they are forced to cut down on purchases.Supply-side factors, infrastructure development can affect how companies supply its goods and services. Weather, political instability and price of commodities also affect the growth and contraction of the economy. In cold weather, people tend to shop less and save more. A rise in the commodities price can affect the spending of consumers looking to cut back.WHY IS INDIA’S GDP FALLING?In the year 2019-2020, the Central Statics Office (CSO) revealed that India’s GDP in the first quarter of the current fiscal seems too declined to six year low at 5%. There are certain reason behind the decline in the Indian GDP:Wrong Process in the GST implementation.Decline in Investment.Poor condition of banking sector.Sharp fall in consumption.Sharp decline in overall demand.Agricultural crisis.FUTURE OF INDIAN ECONOMYIndian is facing the second wave of COVID due to which the GDP rate of the country is much affected. In the year 2020-2021, the central notified the GDP for the annual year, which is contracted by 7.3%, compared to growth of 4% recorded in fiscal year 2019-2020.In such a pathetic situation, India announced such a contraction for the first time in at least four decades. Worst dip since independence. In the month of October-December of 2020, the economy grew by 0.4%, the inflation maintained till quarter four where the GDP grew by 1.6%. In the month of January-March, when the whole economy was near normalcy, everything was opened up. The business and shops were asked to close up due to COVID, the state imposed lockdown in the second wave.The country is also expecting the third wave of COVID, then what would the number tell us about the future of Indian economy? What are the keyways to deal with this situation? Will delay in vaccination affect the growth of the economy?ROLE OF JUDICIARY FOR SECURING THE RIGHTS OF CONSUMER AND SELLERConsumer Court has been set up for special purposes, deals with cases related to consumer conflicts and disputes. Government established Judiciary hearings for protection of consumer rights. This court has been established to perform fair practices and contracts by sellers. Consumers are provided with a right to file a suit against the seller if they are exploited by sellers. There are certain rights granted by the consumer court to all the consumers. Those rights are given as follows:Right to Safety: This right gives protection from all kinds of dangerous goods and services.Right to Information: The right to be totally aware or informed about the presentation and quality of goods and services.Right to consumer Education: This right provides absolute consumer education about the goods and services.Right to Choose: The right provided to consumers to choose any goods and services.Right to Redressal: The right to ask for compensation, anytime when the right of the consumer is exploited.Right to be Heard: The right to be heard in decision-making procedure regarding consumer interest.The main objective of consumer court is to give extra privilege to consumers and to maintain the duties of sellers or services towards consumers.In the Sale of Goods Act, 1930, certain rights are given to the seller. The seller is free to move to court if any of his given rights has been exploited. Such rights have been given below:To exercise lien and keep possession over the goods, until payment of price defined under section 47(1).To resell the goods under some circumstances (section 54).To sue the buyer for the price when the property in the goods has passed to the buyer or when the price is paid on a certain day, in terms of the contract, and the buyer fails to make the payment (section 55).To reserve the right of disposal of the goods until certain conditions are fulfilled defined under section 25(1).To deliver the goods only when applied for by the buyer (section 35).To stop the goods in transmit and resume possession of the goods, until payments of the price defined under section 49(2) and 50.To assume that the buyer has accepted the goods..CHANGES IN CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWOn the date 06 August 2019, the new Consumer Protection Bill was passed by the Parliament, through the suggestion of Rajya Sabha. It was earlier presented in Lok Sabha on July 30, 2019. This bill replaced the Consumer Protection Act, 1986.ProvisionConsumer Protection Act, 1986Consumer Protection Bill, 2019Filing of ComplaintIn this act, the complaint needs to be filed in consumer court where jurisdiction of the seller falls under.A complaint can be filed from where the consumer lives or anywhere.MediationNo provision for mediationCourts can work for the settlement by the way of mediation cells.JurisdictionThe jurisdiction at District level had a complaint worth of Rs. 2 lacs.Can take complaint by District level authorities with goods and services worth up to Rs. 1 crore.Product LiabilityNo provision for product liability.Consumers are provided with the right to ask for compensation for any exploitation.E-CommerceNo provision for E-Commerce.Transaction will come under the provision comprising direct sales.Video ConferencingNo provision for Video conferencing.Consumers can seek hearing via video conferencing.RegulatorNo Central Regulator.Central Consumer Protection Authority to be established. CONCLUSIONThere are certain steps which must be taken by Indian Government to bring India’s economy on track after the decline of GDP.The small producers should be given interest-free loans who have incurred losses for restarting operations.The Government should reduce the expenses on unnecessary goods despite giving money to the state for investing in health care. This could improve the confidence of an individual. They should get encouraged to keep doing economic activities normally by following personal care.The Government should invest to provide migrant workers a safe and comfortable atmosphere. The inflow of migrant workers should revitalize the migrant economy. Curated by Athira Albert of Kristu Jayanti College of Law, Bangalore. "

    "data": "This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida.IMPORTANCE OF MEDICLAIM POLICY(In reference to Advocates BACKGROUNDThe concept of ‘Mediclaim’ was introduced in India in the year of 1986, offering minimum coverage of Rs. 15,000 and a maximum of Rs. 5 lakhs. For the employees in the government sector, the Central Government Health Insurance Scheme was launched, while for the people employed in the private sector, Employees State Insurance Scheme was introduced to cater to their medical necessities. The idea envisaged was narrow in scope and extent, providing minimal insurance relief-only to individuals and their families. There was capping on every relief offered through these policies. With the opening of the market in the 1990s and introduction of diverse economic reforms, health insurance schemes too, witnessed drastic advancement. Removal of sub-limits, entry of private players in the medical sector, increased life expectancy, reforms in the varieties of policies offered- all these factors helped influence the public, pushing them to try various health insurance schemes. Moreover, in 2001, IRDA (Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority) introduced third party administrators, facilitating the set-up between hospitals and companies by providing cashless provisions on their products. With the advancement of technology and the growth of the IT sector as well as the service sector and the wide spectrum of life-style diseases, chronic diseases, critical illnesses etc. plaguing our generation, the need for health insurances and life insurances have taken the market by frenzy.IMPORTANCE/ NEED FOR MEDICLAIM POLICYBearing the current pandemic in mind, as well as the illnesses afflicting our society due to the life-style we pursue, the importance of health insurance cover can be recognised and realised. As families are grappling with the fear and havoc caused by Coronavirus, the inflated costs of hospitalisation, oxygen cylinders, PPE kits, oximeters, masks etc., are burning holes in our collective pockets. Mediclaim policies provide security, protection and confidence in these tough trying times. They ease the financial strain by eliminating expenses which might be out-of-pocket for families who are currently grappling with the clutches of the virus.MEDICLAIM POLICIES AND LAWYERSIt was highlighted by the Madras High Court very recently in re Sudha Ramalingam v. The Bar Council & Ors., W.P. No. 13047 of 2020, Madras High Court (2021) that there are roughly 65,000 advocates on the rolls of the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and none of them are provided any health cover benefits by the said authority. The appalling state of affairs beckon the State and the legal administration to introspect upon their handling of the current crisis and provide respite to their lawyers. The hon’ble court directed the council to set-up a 9-member committee to review the introduction of a group health insurance whose benefits might also be extended to the families of concerned lawyers. In 2019, the Central Government had set up a 5-member committee to frame a health policy supporting a structured framework and also to deliberate upon the modalities of its execution. The scheme was formulated to provide a comprehensive welfare mechanism for all the advocates across India.Yet, the grim reality suggests otherwise about the intentions of the authorities regarding the implementation of this scheme. Delhi Government in collaboration with the Bar Council of Delhi had, in December 2019, contrived a medical insurance scheme for all the advocates residing in Delhi and enrolled with the Bar Council by The New India Assurance Company Limited (NIAC). The scheme was allocated Rs. 40.60 crore out of the Rs. 50 crore budget of the Chief Minister Advocates Welfare Scheme as announced by the Law Minister Kailash Gehlot. Under this scheme, Rs. 5 lakhs have been columnised under medical insurance and Rs. 10 lakhs for term insurance individually. The registration under the scheme started in March 2020 but owing to the Covid-19 pandemic the process got inadvertently delayed. A petition regarding the same was filed before the Delhi High Court urging the court to pass immediate orders as the undue delay of the said welfare scheme was responsible for bereaving the legal fraternity of its benefits, that too in the present unprecedented circumstances.The abysmal delay in the implementation of this scheme rendered many advocates helpless in the times of need and it was only on 10th December, 2020 that the registration was opened by the Delhi Government. Under this welfare scheme, the immediate family members as well as dependent parents are also provided an inclusive cover. According to the data provided by the Bar Association, out of the 37,135 lawyers registered as voters in Delhi 29.098 are on the rolls of the council to avail health benefits under the said welfare scheme. Another commendable health security step has been taken by the Delhi Bar Council by providing a much-needed breather to advocates registered under its tutelage. It has offered financial assistance of Rs. 25,000 (home quarantine) and Rs. 50,000 (hospitalisation and not covered under any scheme) to the advocates afflicted with the virus.CONCLUSIONIn these trying times of extraordinary physical as well as mental anguish the authorities in power should not hold back in assisting their workers. Spotlighting the way ahead, this pandemic has flagged the loopholes in the administration of medical and health infrastructure and services. With the most recent numbers shared by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the current death due to Covid data stands at 31,64,577 globally as on 29th April, 2021. The staggering variety as well as figure of cases is a matter of grave concern for a country as diversely/deeply populated as India with limited medical infrastructure and services which themselves are wrapped in bureaucratic red tape. The legal community, despite the existence of welfare funds, has been deprived of the benefits it may legally derive from the said funds. Streamlining of welfare health benefit schemes is the urgent need in order to bring the legal family under a single umbrella of Mediclaim cover. The central government in association with the BCI and the State Bar Councils should revamp its health policy terms and provide the much-needed respite sought by the advocates for themselves and their families.REFERENCESAkshita Saxena, Madras High Court Constitutes Committee To Make Recommendations On Insurance Cover For 65,000 Lawyers, LiveLaw (April 26, 2021) https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/madras-high-court-insurance-cover-for-lawyers-173129?infinitescroll=1N.

    "headline": "DETENTION CENTRES IN INDIA: A FETID OF HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATION Threat to human rights, bodily integrity highest in thanas: CJI RamanaConcentrated Hurdle: CasteMan Accused of Killing Daughter Courts Troubled by Appealing To SC",
    "data": "This article is written by Robin Kumar Thakur of Chanakya National University, Patna.The very mention of detention centres sends chills down one’s spine, by making the horrific memories of the holocaust afresh as detention camps were the foundation stone of the pillars of the concentration camps of Nazi Germany. Detention centres are meant to house the illegal immigrants, refugees for a short term, before the state machinery decides their fate to deport or give refuge in the country. But the detention centres throughout its history and even now mingers of state-sponsored oppression. The world which was still outraging over the pictures of children being separated from their families at the detention centres at the US-Mexico border and the plight of the Uyghur Muslims in the detention centres of China, when the completion of NRC in Assam brought the detention centres of India into the limelight. PURPOSE OF DETENTION CENTRES IN INDIAThe purpose of detention centres in India was also to house the illegal immigrants, refugees, asylum seekers and stateless persons as a temporary measure before a permanent solution could be achieved. The very purpose of detention centres in India, particularly in Assam was to stop the heavy influx of Bangladeshi migrants into India. The religious persecutions in Bangladesh, the Bangladesh war of independence and the huge economic disparity along with a highly porous border contributed to this illegal migration. The encroachment of the resources by the migrants did not go well with the locals. The locals headed by the All Assam Student Union (AASU) and All Assam Gana Sangram Parishad (AAGSP) started a movement against these migrants. This led to the signing of Assam accords between the movement leaders and the Indian Government in which the government agreed to identify and deport all the illegal migrants from the state. The heavy influx of migrants had changed the political, religious, cultural and social demographic of the land. To protect the cultural, religious, cultural and social demographic of the state the detention centres were established in India, particularly in Assam with the primary aim to curtail the liberties of illegal immigrants and other people of similar stature. Detention centres came in handy to avoid the mixing of illegal immigrants with the local population. The government could easily deport them back to their country from the detention centres. It also restricted their movement and their usher encroachment into Indian territory. THE LEGALITY OF DETENTION CENTRES IN INDIAThe detention centres in India have a legal stamp on them and this legal stamp has been acknowledged by the judiciary of India. The Foreigners Act, 1946 empowers the central government to put restrictions on the movement of foreigners in India. Section 3(2)(e) and Para 11(2) of the Foreigners’ Act, 1946 authorize the operation of detention centres in India. The powers of restricting and deportation of foreigners are further strengthened by the Passport (Entry into India) Act, 1920 which empowers the central government to deport any foreign national who had entered into the country without a proper passport or other travel documents. These powers are entrusted to the state governments under Article 258(1) and to the union territories under Article 259. It was only after the Guwahati High Courts order in the case, State of Assam vs Moslem Mondal, the state government of Assam started to build the detention centres. LIFE IN THE DETENTION CENTRESThe living conditions inside the detention camps can only be understood through the words of its inmates. Kaddus Miya, a former inmate at the Goalpara detention centre recounted his experiences,“Sometimes 60 to 70 people were crammed into one room like a herd of cattle. After 5 pm, there was no one to listen to our plight,” he said. According to him, the detention centre officials planted three or four convicted criminals in each cell to discipline the detainee” Adam Ali, an inmate at the Goalpara detention centre from December 2016 to April 2020 recounts that the cells had not been provided with toilets. He said that in the absence of the toilets the detainees were escorted by guards elsewhere and sometimes the older detainees even soiled in their own clothes or bed. Mohammad Sanaullah, a retired Army veteran, had spent 11 days in a detention centre. On recounting his experience, he stated,“Nearly 40-45 people are crammed inside one room. We had to sleep on the floor, the food was inedible, and the toilets were dirty. Mornings started with one roti and stale tea without milk or sugar; for lunch, there used to be stale rice, watery dal and one sabzi, and a similar routine was followed for dinner. When family members came to visit, we had to talk to them from inside an iron grill while they stayed 5-6 feet away behind a fence. It was my fate that I had to spend time in detention despite being an Indian.” These instances are witness to the inhumane conditions in the detention centres. Despite the assurance by the government that the detention centres were not devoid of any facilities necessary to carry one’s life with dignity, these things did not exist on the ground. Even the basic facilities like food and toilet were not even ensured at the centres. INFRINGEMENT OF HUMAN RIGHTSThroughout its history, detention centres had been a ripe ground for human rights violations and state oppression. The Human rights at the detention centres are infringed in the following ways: Indefinite Incarceration:There exists no prospect of the eventful freedom of the detainees from incarceration as there is an absence of any formal agreement between India and Bangladesh for deportation of these detainees. In absence of such an agreement, there exists a strong possibility that they would spend the rest of their lives in the detention camps. Detention Even After Completion Of Jail TermMany detainees who had completed their terms remained inmates if the detention camps because of bureaucratic tangles and delays between India and their respective countries No Rights And EntitlementsNo legal regime indicates the rights and entitlements of the detainees. Currently, they are governed according to the Assam Jail Manual but the authorities even deny them the benefits of parole, waged work etc. Process Flaws And Lack Of Legal DefenceThe majority of the inmates were deemed to be foreigners by the ex parte order of the tribunals in which most of them lacked any legal representation. Many inmates also did not receive any notice from the tribunal because of them being migrant workers or a variety of reasons. Vulnerability Of Separated ChildrenThe children of the detainees can only remain with them till the age of six in the detention camps. After the children have achieved the age of six, they are declared Indian but their parents remain foreigners. In such cases, the government does not take responsibility for the children and they are left to be taken care of by distant family members and the community. It makes them more vulnerable to human atrocities like human trafficking and child labour. Separation Of Families And Difficulties In Meeting Family MembersMen, women and children aged above 6 years are separated from their families, which further compounds their distress. Since men and women are detained separately and lack permissions or paroles to meet each other they are not able to see their loved ones’ faces for years. Also, the detainees are not allowed legally to communicate in any way to their families even through phone calls. THE NRC CONNECTION WITH THE DETENTION CENTRESOne of the poll promises of the BJP in the 2019 Loksabha elections was the implementation of nationwide NRC. It has been voiced again and again by the Home Minister of India, though after widespread protests the government had taken to the backfoot and denied its implementation. But the NRC of Assam had already raised eyebrows. The NRC in Assam had left out 19,06,657 from the register. These people had been declared as foreigners. But there were also many discrepancies while carrying out NRC like the relatives of the former President of India Fakhruddin Ali Ahmed were left out of the register of citizens. There were numerous instances in which people who had already served in the Indian army were declared as foreigners. The mixture of CAA and NRC also makes the situation more complicated. The CAA ensures that the Hindus, Buddhists, Sikhs, ains and Christians will get citizenship after just 6 years of residing in India. The CAA deliberately leaves out Muslims. If NRC is implemented, the Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists and Jains will easily get citizenship according to the CAA, but the Muslims are likely to be on the receiving end who may be deported or sent to the detention camps. If NRC was to be implemented in India one cannot ignore the possibility of millions of people who failed to prove their citizenship due to illiteracy, little or no legal representation will land in the detention centres. CONCLUSIONThe detention centres in India are against the values of the Indian constitution which ensures basic human rights even for foreigners under Article 19 (A). The subhuman conditions in the detention centres are in contrast with the soul of India. The refusal of basic human rights in the detention camps and the curtailment of their liberties diminishes the image of India as a pioneer of ensuring human rights. The conditions of the detention camps should be improved so that the inmates can live there with dignity. REFERENCESState of Assam v.

    "data": "This article is written by Anjaly Ann Joseph from Government Law College, Ernakulam. INTRODUCTIONSocial media platforms are lauded for facilitating human interactions worldwide. However, slowly it has permeated to day to day life and it is almost impossible to live without them. Apparently social media companies like WhatsApp, Twitter, Facebook and so on, are an undeniable presence in the world today. All possible advantages of social media were explored and celebrated immediately, but the masses are grappling with its pitfalls and the world nations are trying hard to contain them. SOCIAL MEDIA REGULATIONS IN INDIAArticle 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution guarantees freedom of speech and expression to the citizens. Undeniably social media have become a major platform for the exercise of this fundamental right, but as every other fundamental right, speech and expression in social media is subject to reasonable restriction. This reality is contrary to the idea promoted by the tech giants of silicon valley that social media is a space without laws and restraints of a normal society. Social media in India is regulated by the Information Technology Act 2000. According to Section 79 of the Act, social media intermediary will not be liable for any third party information, hosted by him. This is known as a safe harbour provision. However, according to (2), for immunity to be applicable, the function of the intermediary should be limited to providing access to communication system and intermediaries should not initiate transmission, select reliever of transmission, select or modify information in the transmission. Alongside, this provision mandates that due diligence on the part of intermediary. Clause(3) provides situations when intermediaries can be held liable – conspired, abetted, aided or induced to an unlawful act or if intermediary fails to expeditiously remove content notified by government that may lead to an unlawful act. Shreya Singhal v UOI clarified that unlawful content must be taken down upon court order or government order and not the exercise of its own discretion. Section 69A emperors government to order intermediary to block information affecting the interests of the country. Failure to comply with this order can attract punishment of imprisonment up to seven years. The Act also defines intermediaries under section 2(w) as a person who receives, stores or transmits data. Intermediaries include telecom service providers, web housing service providers, search engines, online payment sites, online auction sites, online marketplace and cyber cafes. The Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media ethics code) Rules 2021 mandates due diligence by intermediaries like blocking unlawful information within 36 hours and informing users about rules and regulations, privacy policy and so on. Significant Social Media Intermediaries(SSMI) require additional due diligence including appointing of a chief compliance officer, nodal officer and publishing a monthly compliance report. Also social media intermediaries must track down first originator of information. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN AUSTRALIA AND EUROPEAN UNIONAustralian government is a step ahead with regulation on usage of news content by Facebook and Google with the News Media Bargaining Code passed in February 2021.This act requires tech giants to pay local news agencies for showing their news as snippets and search results. Upon the failure of payment negotiations, they will have to resort to arbitration. Facebook got into a faceoff with government by an unprecedented blackout, preventing users from viewing and sharing new content while Google threatened to leave Australia. They even tried to lobby the government and pursued contracts with local newspapers to negate the law. However, both Facebook and Google complied with some last minute changes in law. These attempts by Australia to ensure fair play in news broadcasting is watched over by the entire world. Moreover, this sets a strong precedent for making the silicon valley to submit to the laws of the land. European Union made a similar move by proposing the novel Digital service Act and Digital Markets Act. In this, Digital Service Act is aimed at curbing at illegal and harmful content in social media. It places liability upon online intermediaries to notify and takedown illegal content within specified time. Also setting up of an internal complaint redressal mechanism is demanded. Transparency regarding online advertising and obligations to disclose algorithms behind the streamlining of content should be made available to the user. Moreover, European Commision will have supervisory power over large platforms. The Digital Markets Act facilitates a level playing field in online commerce. Very large online platforms called as the Gatekeeper platform are mandated to ensure competition in the field by stopping promotion of only its own services. In addition European Union will have a wide range of investigative powers to ensure compliance of the companies. SELF REGULATION AND ACCOUNTABILITY FRAMEWORKThe regulatory attempts of different countries are countered by arguments for self- regulation. Facebook has an Oversight Board to regulate content. It is an independent body within Facebook to decide on content that is unlawful and inflammatory. Unfortunately, there is no transparency regarding the procedure for decision making and penalties. So far, it is found to work on arbitrary principles and procedures. Google formed an AI ethos Board in 2019, and a week later it was dissolved. Moreover the status of social media platforms as intermediaries help them to evade responsibility for all the issues like child pornography, hate speech, inciting violence, data privacy and the like. Section 230 of Communications Decency Act provides the same protection to platforms in the U.S. Similar situations exists worldwide, with a legal lacunae to hold the social media giants accountable. Due diligence on the part of platforms is a reasonable expectation of all the users. Obviously, if the issues created by the social media is properly handled by the platforms itself, there will be no question of the state delving into their affairs. Unfortunately, not only have the social media platform grown into colossal portions, making it impossible to spot and contain the issues swiftly, it has also begun creating ruckus to the peaceful life of citizens, opening an invitation for the state to intervene. POLITICAL INTERFERENCE, BLACKLISTING AND INFLUENCE ON DEMOCRACYSocial media platforms have an absolute role over tarnishing the image of a political leader. Social media platforms are powerful because they have direct access to billions of users. The feeds and news content promoted by the social media on behalf of their political interest will influence the masses in their formulation of opinions and behaviours. The accusations of election interference by social media companies surfaced with its restriction of access to New York Post article on Joe Biden’s son’s emails with employees of Chinese and Ukrainian energy companies. Moreover Trump was blocked by social media platforms. In India twitter has labeled posts of BJP leaders on toolkit case as manipulated media. At least a due process for these disciplinary measures is called for. In addition, social media platforms are found to be a catalyst for social and political mobilisation. A cliche example is the Arab Spring, a revolution which occurred in the Middle East and North Africa. Meanwhile it is true that social media opened a space to discuss, criticize and make leaders accountable, which is clearly a boost to democracy. On the other hand, it sides with political propaganda and they themselves are creating the popular and right opinions. Political persuasion can come easy with the support of social media platforms. Also, platforms are aware of the preferences of its user, which can ease the formation of strategy for election campaigning. In fact Twitter is accused of interfering with Brexit, US presidential election and several other events as such. The same social media companies to claims to be advocates of democracy have conveniently threatened democratic principles and processes. CONCLUSION“Corporations have neither bodies to be punished, nor souls to be condemned, they therefore do as they like”. These are the words of Edward, First Baron Thurlow(1731-1306), the Lord Chancellor during the impeachment of Warren Hasting. Apparently he was referring to East India Company, which enslaved millions in the name of crown. A corporation which had military and courts. An entity which was wealthier and power than the British state itself at a time. The world nations seem to have received enlightenment that social media platforms have the potential to become threats to the state itself. And the governments are trying to bring them within the confines. The confrontation is caused by the unique set of values bred by the silicon valley, that they are superior to everything. However strong arm measures of social media giants earned severe criticism. So more or less they have humbled themselves and started complying with the regulations of maiden nations and these nations have set the ball rolling. REFERENCESShreya Singhal v.

    "data": "This article is written by- Surbhi Kumari from Amity University Patna.IntroductionMoney Laundering is the method in which cash created through criminal activities becomes legitimate cash or “white cash.” So, concealment is reworking black cash into white cash through numerous methods. In recent times, concealment is being related to monetary crimes particularly with the misuse of the national economy. Cash obtained from crimes like extortion, evasion, trading, gambling, etc. The one that makes cash from such activities must “clean” this cash so banks or the other establishment settle for that money without any misgiving. When any criminality is generating plenty of profit, the person or the cluster engaged in such activities gets to manage the profits, while not drawing suspicion to themselves. Criminals do that by changing the shape of the money, disguising the supply of the money or transferring the money to an area wherever it’s unlikely to draw a lot of attention. What is unlawful money?Unlawful Money means money that has been obtained by doing illegal activities like murder, extortion, bribery, drug traffic etc. The method of changing such yield of crime into legal and white cash is known as concealment. In India, there’s a law created for preventing such activities of cash wash called Money Laundering Act,2002. This law is enforced by the Enforcement board of directors in India. Money laundering has an adverse result on economy. It will erode the nation’s wealth by unsteadying the demand and supply of money, creating interest and charge per unit. There are 3 stage of money laundering1. Placement Stage2. Layering Stage3. Integration Stage In the Placement stage, the money or the funds square measure enraptured from its supply. Their square measure through which the initial supply of the funds will be disguised and invisible. This could be done by putting the money into circulation through retailers, casinos, etc. The position stage will be achieved through numerous suggests that such as-• Bank Complicity– this example arises once monetary establishments or banks square measure owned by people UN agency themselves square measure crooked and scheming. They’ll draw deals with drug dealers, human traffickers and different criminal syndicates, which makes the method of laundering horribly straightforward. The alleviation provided by the financial organization allow them to launder the money without any issue.• Currency smuggling– Physically transporting any monetary instruments or money out of the country through outlaw signals currency smuggling. Physical importation does not leave a trail to follow in order to track down the funds.• Asset Purchase– Buying something valuable with laundered money is one of the oldest and most traditional methods of concealing.• Currency Exchanges– in several economies exchange of currency isn’t rigorous and might be done simply to provides area for movement of the money.• The mixing of Funds– the most effective place to cover one thing is to stay with similar things. This manner financial organization could act as a medium of cash wash wherever funds square measure mixed with each other, and it becomes tough to tell apart between the sources of cash. Layering StageIn this stage, the launderers attempt to take away the path of their outlaw cash so it becomes tougher for the law enforcers to trace down the supply of cash. The layering stage includes strategies such as-• Hard money is reincarnated as financial instruments– Once the funds are deposited within the national economy, they are used to purchase financial instruments such as bonds and securities.• Material Assets limb with laundered cash and sold subsequently– Assets square measure bought with the outlaw funds and so they’re sold at intervals in the native market that makes it tough to trace the supply of cash. The Layering stage comes once the position stage. This stage is the most advanced because it involves separating the outlaw cash from its supply. This is often a really subtle method because it involves destroying any previous links of the funds with the initial crime.The mixing StageIn this stage, the money laundry is enraptured into the economy. This is often dissimilar to layering, for within the integration method detection and identification of laundered funds square measure provided through informants. The strategies employed in this stage are-• False Loans and Front Companies– In countries wherever company secrecy laws apply, the criminal teams or people open up their corporations and use the laundered cash to fund such corporations, thus turning the funds into a legal kind.• Property Dealings– one amongst the common practices to launder cash is the sale of property to integrate the laundered reimbursement. Several launderers open up shell corporations and obtain property through the laundered cash and later marketing them. The sale yield square measure is then shown as a legitimate supply of financial gain.• Foreign Bank Complicity– several launderers take the assistance of foreign banks to show their black cash into white cash. Willing help of the foreign banks is protected against enabling Types of Money launderingThis method is additionally called smurfing. During this technique, the laundered cash is shifted into little quantities and becomes deposits so as to avoid suspicion of lavation. These little sums of cash is to purchase money instruments like bearer bonds and money orders, etc.Cash Intensive BusinessBusinesses obtain large sums of money for their activities, deposit it in a special account, and then deposit the laundered money in the same account, thus mixing legitimate and illegal currency. Later, it’s all claimed as legal tender.Trade based launderingDuring this technique, transaction areas are undervalued within the books to disguise the initial supply of cash.Round TrippingDuring this technique, cash is commonly deposited in offshore accounts wherever minimum records are maintained, so shipped backed as FDI.Bank CaptureUsing this method, the launderers’ UN agency buys a stake in a certain bank or financial institution, then shifts the money through the banks with few inspections.5. Tax Amnesties- people who allow unreported assets in tax havens and money.Anti-Money laundering Law in IndiaThe PMLA was enacted within the year 2003 and came into force alongside incidental to Rules in July 2005. Section 3 of the PMLA stipulates that any UN agency, directly or indirectly, who makes an attempt, or assists, or might be a party in attempting, or assisting, or might be a party in attempting, to show reprehensibly obtained currency into unstained supply is guilty of cash lavation. The Act conjointly states the duty upon the money establishments and banks to verify and maintain records of all its purchasers and conjointly of all transactions. They may be asked to furnish such data to the money Intelligence Unit- Republic of India (FIU- IND) and therefore the banks and money corporations are absolutely required to furnish such data. The Director of FIU- IND may punish banks and money establishments if they fail to suit the availability of the PML Act. PMLA conjointly authorizes listed officers to hold out associate degree investigation in cases of cash lavation. They’re conjointly authorised to connect the property that has been obtained through laundered cash. PMLA envisages designation of 1 or additional courts of sessions as Special Court or Special Courts to do the offenses punishable under PMLA and offenses with that the suspect might, underneath the Code of Criminal Procedure 1973, be charged at an equivalent trial. PMLA conjointly empowers the Central Government to group with the Government of the other country to stop any offense underneath PMLA or the equivalent law of the opposite country.Development of PML ActThe Act was amended in 2012, and introduced with the change, the definition of money laundering was broadened. Currently the definition brings its range possession, acquisition, concealment of laundered cash as a criminal offense. Earlier, money-laundering crimes with the exception of great ones like coercion were preoccupied only if the cash concerned was Rs-30 large integer or higher than. With the change, the edge was removed. The PMLA was earlier amended within the year 2005 and 2009 conjointly. The 2012 change received assent in Gregorian calendar month 2013 and came into impact from Feb 2013.ConclusionMoney laundering is a threat to the economy, because of the financial set-up of a rustic. An excellent deal will still be done to fight the matter of cash lavation, and plenty of economies have already established rigorous anti-money laundering laws. It’s terribly evident that money launderers are highly ingenious and inventive. They keep turning out with new ways in which to show illegitimate cash into legitimate cash. Therefore, the structure ought to be versatile enough to find and stop new themes. Curated by Athira Albert of Kristu Jayanti College of Law, Bangalore. "

    "data": " The world is going haywire since the time Covid-19 has conquered almost every part of it. Along with the dooming phase that we have been witnessing in these 2 years, we have also come across certain incidents through news or social media which have left people all over the world aghast and astounded. One of such incidents took place with a woman in the Philippines. The situation that took place was such that the woman had ordered a chicken meal for her son and upon delivery of her order, she received a fried towel [i]. Yes, you read that right. A fried towel!Such an incident isn’t the only one that shook the world. A lot of other similar incidents have taken place in the past as well which have really become an eye-opener for the world. Last year in India, one of such incidents took place wherein a very reputed restaurant in a posh locality in the national capital was termed as a ‘perpetrator’ and was highly criticized for its service and raised questions on the service that they had been rendering for so many years. A man had ordered a very famous South Indian Dish called ‘Dosa Sambhar’ and was delivered the same along with a dead lizard within the dish [ii].Such things leave a big blot on the standards of food safety. Here in India, many of such cases are not even reported and things go on happening again and again. The cases of food poisoning and food adulteration have grown more rapidly in the past decade. This has taken a toll on the health of a lot of people and is a great cause of concern.In India, food adulteration is governed by the Prevention of Food Adulteration Act, 1954. This Act basically mentions the criteria for any food material to considered adulterated.There is also a standard regulating body of every food material getting manufactured called FSSAI (Food Safety and Security Authority of India) which has been established by the Ministry of Health & Family Welfare under the Food Safety and Security Act, 2006, whose functions include packing, storage, distribution, import and sale to ensure the good quality of food. This Act was enforced to set up a single food quality platform for various food products [iii].The question remains, what is the solution to these ongoing problems between restaurants and customers, and what remedy can people as consumers seek for? With such acts and regulations existing in India, what would you do if you order a meal to eat and are delivered with a fried towel or a lizard into your meal?The solutions to this are as follows:Hence, one should know about such legal remedies because a consumer can face such a thing in any part of the country and he/she should be aware of the first resort that they should be going for.

Consumer Forums have been set up at District, State, and Central Levels. If a consumer faces any of the above-mentioned situations in any of the restaurants, he/she can file a complaint in the respective forum depending on the jurisdiction[iv].You can report to the Local Health Authority of District or Commissioner of Food Safety of the State/ Union Territory.You can also seek remedy under the Law of Torts. There is a very famous common law case of Donoghue v. Stevenson, also known as the ginger bottle case, which laid down the foundation of the provision “duty of care”, wherein the House of Lords stated that the manufacturer owes a duty of care against the Consumer, to which, the manufacturer would be held negligent if there is a violation of his duty. This case became the core for providing assistance to people who have been harmed by adulteration. Most common law countries, including India, follow this universal precedent. As a result, consumers have a tort law remedy available to them through the civil courts."

    "data": "This article is written by Robin Kumar Thakur of Chanakya National Law University, Patna. INTRODUCTIONFor a person outside the legal environment devil’s advocate may sound like a polemicist or sophist advocate but for a legal adept, it means a lawyer who is a connoisseur in circumvention of the law. Having the negative aura attached to it by the name itself and the largely negative opinions created by some movies like ‘The Devil’s Advocate’ and the ‘Liars liar’ a layman may address it as an unappealing occupation but for legal professionals, it is one of their wildest fantasies, and to cater to this fantasy there’s no place better than being in corporate law. Corporate law usually deals with the various external interactions between the corporations in the form of financial transactions along with dealing with corporate governance internally. Corporate law is a relatively new field of law with ample opportunities.

Corporate law is a huge amalgamation of various fields like tax laws, company laws, bankruptcy, employment law, labour law, intellectual property, zoning or securities. Usually smaller companies and firms hire single corporate lawyers, and they have to be knowledgeable of many fields to cater to all the demands of the company. Large firms and companies, on the other hand hire multiple corporate lawyers each specializing in their own field. EDUCATION QUALIFICATIONTo become a corporate lawyer one should be a law graduate either from the various 3 year LLB courses or 5 year integrated LLB courses such as BALLB. After completing the bachelors one can opt for specialization in corporate law by enrolling in specialized courses in corporate law like LLM corporate law.Apart from these graduate and post-graduate programmes one can also opt for diploma courses like post-graduate diploma in business law and corporate law.

    "data": " This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida.“A lawyer is a person who writes a 10,000-word document and calls it a ‘brief.’”-Franz KafkaTHE LAW SCHOOL LIFEThousands have walked the paths law students wander, and questioned their choices, looked in the mirror at 3 a.m. with dark circles smiling back at them like the crescent moon on a summer night. Law school life is a tough and long one, preparing the next generation of lawyers for the onslaught (and hopefully the riches) life has to offer later on. Months are spent preparing the memorials for Moot Court competitions, researching through a graveyard of legal databases with cases dating back to 1950s, trying to find that last string of hope to defend imaginary clients in hypothetical set-ups. Monthly internships, a consistent 9 grade point average, research articles, book chapters, daily assignments, college society involvement, co-curriculars- these activities mark the basic checklist in a law student’s CV.One skill that takes the front seat for every law student is legal writing. Yes, the idea of reading a judgement by a learned judge with all the legal jargon scribbled across a few hundred pages seems terrifying to a 1st year law student. Yet as semesters progress, we get accustomed to reading, re-reading and summarising the text within appreciable time. The key is to keep reading as much as we can, be it law journals, articles, judgements, blogs, pleadings, drafts of writs, seniors’ moot memorials- anything and everything we can get our hands on. There will arise no need to mug up maxims or relevant commonly used theories and sections if we keep our reading routine breathing. To master any skill we need our fundamentals on our tips, the theory etched in our memory, hours of practice and perfection in order to deliver our best. Writing hones the lawyer’s intellect and there is no escape around this part of law school. Communication is our tool and in order to master it, we need to be proficient writers and speakers.LAW AND LEGAL WRITINGIt is the lawyer’s job to communicate with the client, the opposing counsel, the judges and the jury (as applicable in certain legal systems) his arguments in a clear, concise manner. Legal research and drafting forms the foundational basis of a successful career in law. Observations of professors Adam Lamparello and Megan E. Boyd in Legal Writing for the Real World: A Practical Guide to Success preach how probably the most important skill we can develop throughout our career is the art of writing efficiently and effectively. In the professional world, writing matters because our ability to write convincingly and persuade a court full of learned men is critical and is based upon how we articulate ideas and structure arguments.LEGALESE- CLARITY, CONCISENESS, ENGAGEMENTIn ‘Making Your Case’, Bryan Garner and Justice Antonin Scalia write that one good technique trumps upon all others. Articulatory elegance, argument edification, sophistication of phrasing—these and all other qualities must be sacrificed if they detract from clarity. We need to understand that a court document is not a play field, it needs a language for communicating effectively, using words which the reader or listener is able to understand in order to fulfill its purpose of communication. Clarity necessitates clear punctuation and grammar. To fulfill the above-mentioned purpose of legal writing some conventional rules and styles of grammar need to be followed otherwise it might lead to conjugation of shared meaning. The importance of clarity in legal writing is not an enlightening memorandum or a persuading brief, but the understanding of the reader.Conciseness in writing is not equivalent with brevity as is confused by most of us. The writing need not be brief, it should be efficient, conveying the author’s points succinctly. The lawyer also needs to understand the intention of the audience receiving his writing. For example, a trial court judge may not have as much time on his hands as an appellate judge and the same should be kept in mind while drafting the respective briefs. Many times, it is not possible to convey all theories and laws in plain language and complex phrasing/expression is unavoidable. Conciseness, in writing, is a virtue with sentences containing no unnecessary and avoidable words making it clearer, easy to digest. It is not required in all sorts of writing, but it is required in legal writing since the reader has little time to give and will either resent or refuse to read inflated jargon.“No matter how sound your reasoning, if it is presented in a dull and turgid setting, your hearers—or your readers—will turn aside. They will not stop to listen. They will flick over the pages. But if it is presented in a lively and attractive setting, they will sit up and take notice. They will listen as if spellbound. They will read you with engrossment.”In these words, Lord Denning made it clear that the reader will not read a document, no matter how concise and clear, if it is not engaging. Instead of employing a monotonous tone we need to engage in variety. Frivolous words are not required, rather a creative phrasing on part of the writer to keep the interest of his reader unwavered. Other techniques used by legal writers to make their text more engrossing is the voice of the writer, employing humour, and other classic rhetoric like pathos (one of the three modes of persuasion as per Aristotle- ethos, logos and pathos).CONCLUSIONClarity and engagement are two essential elements of good legal writing, although they can sometimes clash. When they do, the skilled legal writer must discover a suitable compromise between them. These and many other varied skills need to be acquired by law students in order to be successful legal professionals. As lawyers, our words hold the weight of the argument, the fate of our clients and to deliver justice to our client as well as profession, we need to realise the importance of legalese. The five years of our law school life are our formative years and we should utilise this time building/bettering our skills.REFERENCESMegan E.

    "headline": "A STANCE ON THE FARMER BILL OF 2020JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND INDEPENDENCEBrief on Right to Privacy JudgementMoot Court Preparation Course",
    "data": "This article is written by Girija Rani Mullapudi from Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University (vizag ).INTRODUCTIONThis article gives an outlook on new Farmer Bill 2020 amendments. This article aims to provide information on the enactment of the farmer bill by legislation, legislative amendments, farmer fears, demands, protests, the role of the Supreme Court, and the constitutionality of the reform laws, as well as the author’s personal opinion on the issue.Agriculture is the primary source of income for approximately 58 percent of India’s population, including 70 percent of rural households, with 82 percent of these being small and marginal farmers. Under the 2015-16 Farm Census, about 5 hectares of land was purchased by about 86.2 percent of small and medium-sized farmers.Mr. Ram Nath Kovid, India’s president, signed the Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Bill 2020, the Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Bill 2020, and the Essential Commodities (Amendment) Bill 2020 on September 27, 2020. During the recently ended Monsoon season, the parliament passed these laws.The factor to look about, indeed, are the farmers whose development is achieved by these acts on the streets. From September 2020, farmers’ groups such as the Bhartiya Kisan Union (BKU) and the All India Kisan Sangharsh Coordination Committee (AIKSCC) have been opposing the bills. They have lifted the hashtag “Kisan Bachao Mandi Bachao.” In this article, we will address the changes brought on by the new Acts, why farmers are protesting, and what the next steps are.REFORMS IN THE FARMER BILL 2020The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce Bill, 2020, has far-reaching consequences, especially for Punjab and Haryana. The declared goals of this Bill are to give farmers more options in exporting their agricultural products, increase remuneration, and encourage large-scale private investment into agro-businesses.Essentially, the Bill aims to legalise contract farming, allowing farmers to sell their agricultural produce outside of the APMC within a national system that aims to protect and encourage farmers so that they can engage with agro-business companies, major retailers, and farm produce exporters without fear of being exploited.The Act, under which the Central Government is allowed to control the supply of such foodstuffs only in exceptional circumstances, is included in section 3(1A) of Bill 2020 on basic commodity (Annex). Its aim is to protect and improve farmers’ income as well as consumers’ interests.WHAT IS THE FEAR OF FARMERS?Farmers’ associations in Punjab and Haryana say the new laws passed at the Center will dismantle the MSP scheme. In the course of time big businesses dictate conditions and producers get less for their crops. Farmers worry they will not get a guaranteed price for their crops through virtual dislocation of the mandi scheme, and ‘arthiyas’ – commission agents who also loan them in will be out of business. Since they fear the provisions of these Bills could be the forum the government (at the center) establishes to substitute or remove the supported scheme, otherwise robust in its countries, to buy their crops, Uttar Pradesh, Punjab, or Haryana farmers are annoyed. They worry that, under the excuse of offering farmers more playground and better forums, their MSP guarantees that their safety net was launched after the Green Revolution of the 1960s.In these places, the procurement infrastructure powered by state-government crops is very strong. The Food Corporation of India procurement at MSP promises farmers to concentrate on making more returns before any season of agricultural operation. 23 crops have MSPs, but the governments only acquire rice and wheat in the first place. Farmers dread the two new bills as they worry that both government procurement and the MSP will be killed by these agricultural reforms. We see most protesters from Punjab and Haryana since they are the major beneficiaries of this security network.HOW MSP IMPACTS FARMINGWhen it purchases crops from the producers, MSP is the minimum price charged by the Nation. The State Agricultural Cost and Price Commission (CACP), after determining the cost of cultivation, announces it more than 22 commodities each year. The Indian Food Corporation (FCI), the major state-owned agency of grain procurement, buys paddy and wheat mostly only at certain rates. The FCI then offers these crops to the poor at heavily subsidised prices and is then paid for its losses by the government.DEMANDS FROM FARMERSThe main requirement is the removal of the three regulations deregulating the export of their crops. Farmers’ associations also have the legal certainty, preferably by amending the rules, that the MSP scheme can proceed. They also urge that the energy proposal (amendment) Bill 2020 be withdrawn and that the subsidised electricity be stopped. Farmers also argue that they should not be subject to laws against stubble burning. THE RESPONSE OF THE GOVERNMENT The government has projected three farm laws as major agricultural reforms that abolish intermediaries and make it possible for farmers to sell anywhere in the world. The Agricultural Product Marketing Committee (APMC) was able to sell agricultural product for the first time until 2020. However, following the Law in 2020 on the Commercial and Commercial Produce of Farmers (Promotion and Facilitation), it enables farmers to sell outside of APMC in India. Several Ministers of the Union called on farmers not to misunderstand the amendments. The Ministry of Agriculture & Farmers’ Welfare Narendra Singh Tomar said that rejecting the demands for the inclusion of the Minimum Aid Price (MSP) as mandatory clause in Farm Bills, though government commitments to MSP “was never a legal aspect” earlier and “is not” today.HOW ARE THE BILLS GOING TO HELP FARMERS?The three farms’ laws provide the farmer with three fundamental freedoms.ROLE OF SUPREME COURT On receiving many petitions for farmers protesting, the enforcement of farm law was suspended on 12 January 2021 by the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has established a committee to examine complaints relating to agricultural legislation by 20 February 2021, the Committee requested proposals from the public on farm rules.CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THE LAWSThe constitutionality of legislative legislation can be questioned only on two grounds, according to Union of India v H.S. Dhillon the matter is on the State List, or it violates fundamental rights. Is it compliant with the federalist scheme and the spirit of the Constitution to use legislative rights on agriculture? Is it possible for Parliament to pass legislation governing agricultural markets and lands? Should the Constitution have been changed before these legislations were enacted?The Farmers (Empowerment and Protection) Agreement on Price Assurance and Farm Services Act, 2020, and The Farmers’ Produce Trade and Commerce (Promotion and Facilitation) Act, 2020, do not address the legislative arrangements by which Parliament has the power to legislate on the topics covered in their Statements of Objects and Reasons.CONCLUSION According to my opinion agriculture plays an important role in our country, and in order for that to happen, it is necessary to strengthen the agrarian sector, for which three acts have been passed by the Indian parliament, but they have received some criticism due to their loopholes, as those loopholes can only bring corporate India, but if we can reform them in such a way that those loopholes are eliminated, we will be able to achieve our goal.REFERENCES Curated by Shivanshika Samaddar of National Law University Delhi.

    "data": "This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida. BACKGROUNDThe Covid pandemic has left in its wake another innocent bystander suffocating – children. With the virus strangling the life out of their families, children as young as 6 months old are left to face this world alone. Families of these orphaned children have shut their doors, raising concerns about the possibility of infection. The emotional distress and anxiety among the children are at an all-time high, with news channels as well as social media flooding with cries of help. This issue has come under the radar in the second wave of the pandemic, flagging the flawed adoption system of our country. In this article we will look at the various adoption processes in India and how the current situation is being exploited for trafficking children, the role of NGOs and what must be done by the citizens as well as the State authorities to ward-off the impending crisis.LAWS RELATED TO ADOPTION IN INDIAAdoption in India is governed by personal laws, and due to the diversity of religions practised in our country, there are primarily two sets of laws that apply. As formal adoption is prohibited in certain religions, the Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 governs Muslims, Christians, Parsis, and Jews. Hindus, Sikhs, Buddhists, and Jains, on the other hand, adhere to the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956. As per UNICEF data, India has 29.6 million abandoned and orphaned children. These children are vulnerable and often end up becoming victims of sexual violence, human trafficking while some rare few are taken up by adoption agencies and put on waiting lists.HINDU ADOPTION AND MAINTENANCE ACT, 1956Every Hindu, male or female, has the legal power to adopt if they have reached the age of majority and are of sound mind, according to modern Hindu law. The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 enumerates the majority of these laws, norms, and regulations. This Act addresses issues such as the capacity to adopt, the capacity to give in adoption, the effect of adoption, gender bias, and other issues.GUARDIANS AND WARDS ACT, 1890The Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 was enacted to supersede all previous legislation on the subject. Except for the state of Jammu and Kashmir, it became the sole non-religious universal law governing the guardianship of children. This rule is especially ordained for Muslims, Christians, Parsis, and Jews because their personal laws only allow for guardianship rather than complete adoption.JUVENILE JUSTICE ACT, 2015The existing Central Adoption Resource Authority (CARA) has been designated as a statutory organisation to enable it to perform its role more efficiently in order to sort out adoption procedures for orphaned, abandoned, and surrendered children. Adoption is covered in its own chapter (Chapter VIII), which contains comprehensive provisions on the subject.CURRENT SITUATION- #COVIDORPHANSChildren have become the masked, invisible victims of this catastrophe. A child’s emotional, social and cognitive development is adversely affected due to parental loss. It hampers their mental well-being, giving rise to depression, anxiety, unhealthy sleep patterns, and in most cases, strikes at the economic stability of the family, leading to loss/decline in access to education.On social media, stories of orphaned and abandoned children have begun surfacing, interrupting hospital distress calls for emergency oxygen supplies. Covid-19 has killed almost 2,50,000 people in India in the last year—mothers, fathers, aunts, grandparents, adults who have left voids in families, and heartbroken children. Due to a recent spike of similar deaths, the hashtag “covidorphan” began trending on social media. Adoption requests for “covidorphan” children are also being spread via WhatsApp forwards, along with their residential addresses and photographs. Activists point out that such posts and ads are in violation of Sections 80 and 81 of the Juvenile Justice (JJ) Act, 2015, which ban giving or receiving children outside of the Act’s processes, as well as their sale and purchase. Such activities are punishable by three to five years in prison or a fine of one lakh rupees.There is no official figure of how many “covidorphans” there are. In the next few weeks, many more children are likely to lose their parents. However, in the midst of the retweets and reposts, the emotional health of children whose parents are either in the hospital, or have lost the battle is not receiving enough attention.CHILDREN AS VICTIM: TRAFFICKING, EXPLOITATION ETC.Experts anticipate that the global mortality toll from COVID-19 could reach 10 to 40 million, leaving many children without one or both parents or other caretakers. Orphaned children are especially prone to human trafficking and other forms of exploitation, such as sexual exploitation, forced begging, street peddling, and other forms of child labour. Elder siblings are often forced to drop out of schools in order to support their family financially, and also to look after their younger siblings.Meenu Mehta, head of the West Delhi Child Welfare Committee (CWC), believes that trafficking is on the rise. Despite so many messages being posted on WhatsApp in the last three weeks, no child has been registered as orphaned in her district, raising questions and doubts we fear answers to. Despite COVID and the 30,000 waiting families, there are only 2289 children available for legal adoption in India right now.STEPS TAKEN BY AUTHORITIESThe Women & Child Development Ministry has drawn out a lawful mechanism for the rehabilitation of children who have lost their parents to Covid-19, advising the public to desist from partaking in or promoting posts for adoption being circulated on social media, which is in violation of legal regulations;Persons interested in adopting orphan children should contact the Central Adoption Resource Authority for legal adoptions, according to the ministry;The regulatory authorities have informed that if you have information on a child in need of care, call one of the four agencies listed below: Childline 1098, the district Child Welfare Committee (CWC), the District Child Protection Officer (DCPO), or the State Commission for Protection of Child Rights’ helpline;The YS Jaganmohan Reddy-led government in Andhra Pradesh has asked officials to set aside a sum of ten lakh rupees for each kid who has lost both parents as a result of the Covid-19 illness;Apart from rehabilitating orphaned children, the Odisha government stated it will care for children whose parents had to be hospitalised owing to the coronavirus sickness (COVID-19). The state Women and Child Development and Mission Shakti department has designated joint secretary Rega Geetarani Pattanayak to identify and care for children orphaned by COVID-19;Himachal Pradesh Chief Minister Jai Ram Thakur has announced monthly Rs.2,500 grant to the orphaned children till they attain majorityPunjab government announced that children orphaned by the Covid pandemic will receive Rs. 1,500 per month as a social security pension, as well as free education up to graduation, etc.IS THIS ENOUGH?Instead of publishing advertisements asking other people to report single and double orphans, the government should proactively utilise its own database of deaths caused by Covid-19 and not place primary reliance on helplines. Cash transfers being announced by states no doubt will aid the children financially and support their education but it is not enough to keep them away from labouring post-school/coaching. The Right to Education section 12(1)(c) provides for free education of orphans in the private school of their choosing and despite confirmed seats the situation is not so in practice. An endless documentation process follows these and other assistive policies which hamper their implementation. Insistence on death certificate and Covid-19 positive test report submission is a practice in vain as the State authorities already have the required data in their database. Roles played by NGOs and other State welfare commissions are very crucial in our fight against exploitation of children. Instead of going for adoption, kinship care should be prioritised as it helps the child to retain the known family institution and not suffer another trauma of settling in another atmosphere.REFERENCESOrphans |Press Centre|, UNICEF (June 16th 2017) https://www.unicef.org/media/media_45279.htmlHindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, s.7.Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956, s.9.Guardians and Wards Act, 1890, Childline India Foundation, http://www.childlineindia.org.in/Guardians-and-Wards-Act-1890.htmJuvenile Justice (CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) Act, 2015- http://cara.nic.in/PDF/JJ%20act%202015.pdfJuvenile Justice (CARE AND PROTECTION OF CHILDREN) Act, 2015, supraCOVID-19’s Devastating Impact on Children, HRW.ORG (April 9th 2020) https://www.hrw.org/news/2020/04/09/covid-19s-devastating-impact-childrenCurated by Shivanshika Samaddar of National Law University, Delhi.

    "data": "This article is written by Girija Rani Mullapudi from Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University (Vizag).This article focuses on the Government’s recent decision to decriminalise the dishonour of cheques under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. This article discusses the decriminalization notification, the government’s statement and reasoning, the merits and demerits of decriminalization, and the conclusion (personal opinion of the author).INTRODUCTIONThe Indian government has undertaken a number of measures in the last several months in response to the disturbances created by the Covid-19 outbreak. One of such measure was on June 8, 2020, the Ministry of Finance sought government oversight on a proposal to decriminalise a number of minor offences in order to lower the burden of possible criminal responsibility on enterprises, shorten the time it takes for cases to be resolved, and improve the ease of doing business in India. The Finance Ministry has also declared that decriminalisation will be a part of the post-COVID-19 reaction strategy to recover the economy and enhance the justice system in India. Cheque dishonouring was one of the crimes sought to be decriminalized under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (“the Act”). The proposition was met with immediate resistance from both inside and beyond the legal community. We, on the other hand, believe that decriminalizing cheque dishonouring would not have the enormously negative impact that most opponents of the plan believe it will.By decriminalizing Dishonour of Cheque, as well as 38 other petty economic offences, one such proposal was passed through circular dated June 8th to fulfill the objectives of SabkaSaath, SabkaVikas, and SabkaVishwas. The finance ministry has suggested that 38 different offences be decriminalized through 19 different Acts. There are several clauses of various laws that invite criminal prosecution and penalties, including detention, fines, and other forms of punishment, even for minor rules violations or minor procedural lapses. This has a negative impact on the corporate community. As a result, the government is considering decriminalizing a number of offences, which will be a move in the right direction of achieving the much-coveted goal of incentivizing more domestic and foreign investment by promoting ease of doing business.Since punishment for such a crime may have a deterrent effect on business and investments, the goal is to make business transactions easier. The Makwana case may be used to justify such a plan. In the case of Makwana Mangaldas Tulsidas v State of Gujarat, the Hon’ble Supreme Court noted that over 35 lakh cases of cheque dishonour were pending and filed a suo motu case to formulate a procedure to resolve such cases.The Ministry of Finance recently released a public notice titled “Decriminalization of Minor Offenses for Improving Business Sentiment and Unclogging Court Processes,” inviting stakeholders to comment on the proposed decriminalization of a number of offences, including S.138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881, which makes check dishonour a criminal offence.The Key Reasons for this proposal are:The possibility of incarceration for acts or omissions that are not actually illegal deters domestic and foreign investment.Legal ambiguity and the time it takes for courts to resolve disputes affects the ease of doing business.These considerations are much more important in developing a post-COVID-19 response strategy to boost economic growth and improve the justice system.Provisions that are merely procedural in nature and do not affect national security or the public interest should be reconsidered.Reclassifying criminal offences to compoundable offences should be done with the aim of growing the burden on businesses.The Government is considering decriminalizing a number of offences, which would be a step toward achieving the much-desired aim of encouraging ease of doing business in order to draw more domestic and foreign investment. In order to attract both international and domestic investment, a country’s policies and regulations must be business-friendly, with no retaliation for slight lapses or violations of rules that can be easily rectified.MERITS OF DECRIMINALIZATIONAccording to the Law Commission of India’s 213th Report, there were over 38 lakh cases of cheque dishonour pending in courts, with over 7.6 lakh cases pending in criminal courts at the magistrate level alone in Delhi.Due to the large backlog of these cases, other cases are still put on hold, giving criminal the justice system a bad reputation.Cheque dishonour can be punished under section 420 of the Indian Penal Code and hence, there is no need for a separate provision for the same reason.The crime has been significantly reduced by making it a compoundable offence, demonstrating the legislature’s desire to reduce the backlog of such cases.DEMERITS OF DECRIMINALIZATIONSection 138 goal is to improve the integrity of checks, making business transactions safer and more effective. It’s possible that decriminalising it would make accepting checks more difficult. This may lead to a lack of confidence in business practices.The civil court alternative is time-consuming and expensive. Many payees are from the poorer sections of society and cannot bear the costs of civil litigation.The threat of criminal prosecution ensures that the drawer honours the checks; decriminalisation will eliminate this fear.A cheque is mainly used as means of credit in the form of ‘post-dated cheque’, decriminalising it would strip away the credibility which can cause decline to economic activity.It will over-burden the civil courts.CONCLUSIONIn the views of the author, instead of decriminalizing the dishonour of cheques through and through, a more adjusted methodology might be to fix a base edge limit for summoning the criminal purview in such cases. This could be fixed at Rs. 1 lakh or such other sum as discovered suitable by Parliament. This will guarantee that holders of checks in bigger exchanges are ensured by a strong criminal cure, subsequently keeping up the first administrative purpose, while simultaneously lessening some degree of weight on the criminal courts by removing more modest cases and giving some aid to people/elements who don’t need to confront indictment in the event of little exchanges. All in all, it is the author’s view that the arrangements of Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, be held. The COVID-19 outbreak has made a huge impact on economies all around the world, and the growth in financial crime that has resulted is unquestionable. While regulatory leniency, increasing hurdles to entrance into formal bankruptcy procedures, and the extending of procedural deadlines are all positive steps, decriminalizing Section 138 may be too far.REFERENCESGovernment of India Ministry of Finance Department of Financial Services, 8th June, 2020, https://financialservices.gov.in/sites/default/files/Decriminalization%20-%20Public%20Comments.pdf , May 3, 2021.S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.Makwana Mangaldas Tulsidas v.

    "headline": "ANALYSIS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 2019Should the Death Penalty be Abolished in India?WOMEN SAFETY IN A CABCitizen Amendment Act 2016 by Modi Government: Read more to know about pros and cons",
    "data": "This article is written by Robin Kumar Thakur from Chanakya National University, Patna. The Indian government introduced the Consumer Protection Act 2019 in the era where the markets went through a rapid makeover. Unexplored avenues like e-markets had just begun opening up for the consumers. The Indian market in the quest to match up with the advancements around the world along with modern India’s inspiration of becoming a five trillion economy began calls for exponentially increased consumption. This rapid increase in consumption triggered an increase in information asymmetry, and businesses tended to take unfair advantage of the age-old laws which didn’t take into account the modern avenues of the market. FEATURES OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019The preamble of this act states:“An Act to provide for protection of the interests of consumers and for the said purpose, to establish authorities for timely and effective administration and settlement of consumers’ disputes and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto.” Provision for Minors: Section 2 (5)(vii) of this act brings minors under the ambit of the consumer meaning that the minor can enjoy the rights of a consumer and if aggrieved can reach out to the authorities with the help of their parents or legal guardian.Advertisements: Section 2(1) of the act defines “advertisement” . The law now can hold manufacturers, service providers, celebrity endorsers accountable for coming up with misleading advertisements. If the consumer falls prey to any misleading advertisements through any of these mediums, then the aggrieved consumer can approach the authorities for relief.Product liability: A new clause of “product liability action” has been added to the definition of complaint. Here the liability of the product lies against the product manufacturer, seller or service provider as the case may be.Unfair Contract: Through sec 2(6)(i), unfair contract has also been added to the definition of the complaint. By this, the act ensures that larger businesses can not build on their profits by unfair or restrictive trade practices.E-commerce: Two terms e-commerce and electronic service provider have been added in sec 2(16) and 2(17) respectively. These have been brought to bring the e-market under the ambit of consumer protection laws. These strengthen the rights of the e-consumers and make the e-commerce businesses answerable in case of any right. Infringement. The provisions under Section 2(9) are the most important feature of the Consumer Protection Act of 2019 which defines consumer rights as the right: to be protected against the marketing of goods, products or services which are hazardous to life and property;to be informed about the quality, quantity, potency, purity, standard and price of goods, products or services, as the case may be, so as to protect the consumer against unfair trade practiceto be assured, wherever possible, access to a variety of goods, products or services at competitive prices;to be heard and to be assured that consumer’s interests will receive due consideration at appropriate fora;to seek redressal against unfair trade practice or restrictive trade practices or unscrupulous exploitation of consumers; andto consumer awareness; DISPUTE RESOLUTIONCentral Consumer Protection AuthorityThe primary distinction of the Consumer Protection Act 2019 from the Consumer Protection Act 1986 is the setting up of regulatory authorities to regulate matters related to consumer rights’ infringement. Chapter 3 of the consumer protection act of 2019 establishes the Central Consumer Protection Authority (CCPA) which has the powers to regulate matters entertaining false or misleading advertisements, unfair trade practices and other matters related to consumer’s right infringement. Consumer Disputes Redressal CommissionChapter IV of the Act establishes the Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission which has the powers to resolve disputes arising out of restrictive or unfair trade practices, MRP and hazardous goods. It has to be set up at three levels, i.e. the District, State and National levels (commissions). Though these commissions had been already established by the consumer protection act of 1986, by this act the jurisdiction, as well as powers of the commission, were enhanced. District Consumer Disputes Redressal CommissionDistrict Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission entertains the complaints where the value of the goods and services paid as consideration does not exceed one crore rupees. Under section 34(2)(d) of the act, now complaint can be filed in the jurisdiction in which the complainant resides or works for his\\her gains or in the jurisdiction where the other party resides, has his|her business or personally work for gains. It is headed by a President who is assisted by not less than two or more than the number prescribed in consultation with the central government. State Consumer Disputes Redressal CommissionState Consumer Disputes Redressal commission entertains the complaints where the consideration exceeds one crore rupees but does not exceed ten crore rupees. The commission consists of a president assisted by not less than four or more than than the number prescribed in consultation with the central government. National Consumer Disputes Redressal CommissionNational Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission entertains the complaints where the consideration exceeds ten crore rupees. The National Commission consists of a President who is assisted by not less than four and not more than such number of members as may be prescribed. This commission primarily functions in the national capital region and the central government has powers to establish branches. MediationThe most important and new provision of the consumer protection act 2019 is mediation. Section 74 of this act empowers the state government to establish a consumer mediation cell to be attached to each of the District Commissions and the State Commissions of that State and the Central government to the National Commission and each of its branches. This cell has been set up to resolve consumer related disputes through mediation without having to approach the commissions. PROS AND CONS OF THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 2019 PROS:The act guarantees Consumer sovereignty over choice of goodsConsumers are protected from false and misleading advertisementsThe redressal machinery is within easy reach to the consumers.It ensures redressal in case of defective products or services,It ensures fast track redressal of complaints. CONS:Only those activities for which a payment is made comes under this act. Many free activities like a prescription from a government hospital, or basic civil services escape the liability in case consumer rights are infringed.The act does not mention the definition of safety requirements and the permissible hazardous levels of hazardous goodsIt does not empower the commissions to take cases suo moto and it also forbids the consumer from filing any complaint to the commission if other remedies are available in some other law.If the liability is put against an organisation the commission has no right to impose liability on the higher ranking officials of that organisation EFFECT ON CONSUMERS AND SELLERSThe Act has ensured a smooth transition from the principle of “caveat emptor” to the principle of “caveat venditor”. In simple terms, this Act has ensured that the customer enjoys their right to the fullest and the sellers beware of the products and services they are providing. The Act gives immense rights to the consumer and makes the seller liable in case of a defect in any of its services or products. The seller has to ensure that its products are neither defective and hazardous to the customer nor he practices any unfair or restrictive trade practices . The Act ensures that the consumer is fully protected and well informed about the quality, standard, quantity and purity of the product and in case his rights are infringed provides fast redressal. This Act has made the seller more accountable to the consumers for their products. CASE LAWSHorlicks Limited v. Zydus Wellness Products Limited, 2020 AIR CC 2416In this case, the High Court restrained Zydus from advertising a commercial comparing Complan to Horlicks stating that the same was misleading and disparaging. Connaught Plaza Restaurants Ltd. v. Kapil Mitra, 2020 SCC OnLine NCDRC 192In this case, the petitioner had participated in a McDonald’s scheme. He alleged that the scheme was an unfair practice as details of the entire scheme and the result of the entire scheme was not revealed. The court held this scheme as an unfair practice. CONCLUSIONThe Consumer Protection Act 2019 has successfully managed to address the problems for which it was brought. It was a much-required change as the previous law had become outdated and couldn’t cater to the modern needs of the consumer. Now the consumer stands much empowered as the law has clearly defined rights and a fast-tracked dispute resolution process. The act is surely a welcoming move but it also lacks on some fronts. Involvement of the executive in the affairs and less consumer awareness are one of the main hurdles now. Though the act may not be perfect but it provides better protection to the consumers in these modern days of digitalization REFERENCESTHE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019, NO 35, ACTS OF PARLIAMENT,2019 (INDIA)THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019, SEC 10, NO 35, ACTS OF PARLIAMENT,2019 (INDIA)THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019, SEC 28, NO 35, ACTS OF PARLIAMENT,2019 (INDIA)THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019, SEC 42, NO 35, ACTS OF PARLIAMENT,2019 (INDIA)THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019, SEC 53, NO 35, ACTS OF PARLIAMENT,2019 (INDIA)THE CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019, SEC 74, NO 35, ACTS OF PARLIAMENT,2019 (INDIA) Curated by Shivanshika Samaddar of National Law University Delhi.

GNCTD: UNFAIR TO EXPECT CHILDREN ORPHANED DUE TO COVID TO PROCURE DOCUMENTS FOR AVAILING BENEFITS UNDER WELFARE SCHEMES: DELHI HCRIGHTS OF NURSES AGAINST THE DEROGATORY BEHAVIOR OF PATIENTS",
    "data": "This article is written by Robin Kumar Thakur of Chanakya National Law University.“Out of the last 16 to 17 Chief Justices, half have been corrupt.”– Legal Activist And Supreme Court Lawyer Prashant Bhushan (2009)Echoed by Shanti Bhushan, Law Minister (2010) Corruption happens to be one of the main parasites degrading the social fabric of India, and it has not gone easy on the judiciary either. The judiciary enjoys the highest place among the trinity in public conscience and confidence and if charges of corruption are labelled against it the last bastion of public hope in government also falls. The corruption charges against the Judiciary results in public mistrust which is very fatal as public faith is the sine qua non for the smooth functioning of Judiciary. HISTORY OF JUDICIAL CORRUPTION IN INDIAThe history of judicial corruption in independent India dates back even before the constitution was drafted, such as in the case of Justice SP Sinha of the Allahabad High Court who was charged with improper exercise of judicial functions along with lowering the dignity of his office and undermining the public trust in the judiciary. He was removed under the Government of India Act, 1935. Other cases such as Justice V Ramaswami (found guilty for charges relating to gross abuse of his financial and administrative powers as the Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court and criminal misappropriation of property), Justice Soumitra Sen of the Calcutta High Court (found guilty for misappropriation of large sums of money in her capacity as the receiver appointed by the High Court of Calcutta and misrepresentation of facts with regard to this misappropriation of money before the High Court of Calcutta), Justice Karnan (charged with contempt of court). REASONS BEHIND JUDICIAL CORRUPTION IN INDIAContempt Of Court Act: This Act brushes aside any possibility of critical criticism of the judiciary, suppressing public criticism of all kinds and taking away any system of check and balances for the conduct of the judiciary.Lack of transparency: The Indian judiciary does not fall under the ambit of the RIght to Information Act 2005, hence covering up for the lack of transparency and the ambiguity over almost every decision of the judiciary, sub-standardizing accountability and standards of the system.Inaccessibility: The high cost of litigation, slow disposal of cases and English as the official court language expands the drastic gap between the privileged and non-privileged, inviting corruption as the party on the weaker side falls prey to the broken system in the somewhat alien land.Weak Bar-Bench Relationship: The faith of the general public in the Indian Judiciary mainly depends on the cardial relation between the Judges and the Advocate. The weakening of the cardinal relationship between the Judges and the Advocates due to the mutual lack of trust and honour along with the ‘uncle judge syndrome’ demeans the justice delivery.Weak Governments: The trinity of legislature, executive and the judiciary in the Indian system is a system of checks and balances. If one of them becomes weak the others become rather dictative. If one of them starts to enjoy tremendous powers without check from the other, instances of abuse of power will incur. If the judiciary becomes rather dictative in the presence of a weak legislature and executive, the scope of judicial corruption will increase as there are no checks on it.WHY PEOPLE PATRONISE CORRUPTION IN JUDICIARYThe judges or administrator alone cannot be held accountable for the breakdown of the justice system; the approach of people towards this institution too, plays a major part, with people patronising corruption so that the results are favourable to them. The reasons behind this patronisation of corruption is:Sped-up Judgements: One of the main reasons behind the patronization of corruption is the delay in justice delivery. In India, about 4.4 crore cases were pending as of 15th April 2021. The layman who has to also make their both ends meet find it very hard to cope with the dates of their case. This shortcoming of the system calls for corruption as a corrupt judge is more likely to give the judgement in no time.Favourable Judgement: People with resources may offer and pay bribes to various officials of the justice delivery system including judges so that they can get a favourable judgement.Lack of Stringent Laws: Laws like law of torts are uncodified and some rules and regulations like in bail are very basic. It depends upon the judges to deliver judgements in such cases. The possibility of influencing the judgement which entirely depends upon the discretion of the judge broadens the ambit of corruption.SUGGESTIVE REFORMSIncrease In The Number Of Judges: The filling up of vacancies so as the judges are less burdened with the cases. It will also help in faster trial processes and judgements.Court Record Management: The court record management should perform to its optimum which can only be achieved by updating it with modern technology. It will ensure real-time data of legal documents and cases along with transparency in the court proceedings.Passing Of Judicial Standard And Accountability Bill: In 2010 a judicial standard and accountability bill was put on the table of Lok sabha by the ministry of law and justice which mandated the declaration of assets of the judges as well as their family members. It also laid down judicial standards to remove high court and supreme court judges. The Bill had provisions for the establishment of the National Judicial oversight Committee, the complaints scrutiny panel and an investigation committee. The Bill had provisions to empower the common man by giving them the right to complain about any judge. This bill at present, has not been passed.Better Pay For The Judges: There are many instances where several legal luminaries do not want to become judges because of the lesser pay of judges as compared to that of the advocacy. Better pay will not only ensure that the judges are well qualified and learnt but will also ensure that the corruption decreases as financially strong judges are less likely to take bribes.Annulment Of Contempt Of Court Act: The Contempt of Court Act should be revoked or it should be ensured that it is used in the rarest of the rare circumstances. It would ensure that the judiciary falls within the ambit of public criticism and its decisions can be questioned without a light of fear.CONCLUSIONJudicial corruption is like a parasite for the judiciary. It does not only hamper the day to day proceedings of the judiciary but it also eats away the public trust and the reputation of the judiciary as the most reliable and clean of the trinity of the legislature, executive and the judiciary. The judiciary is still run by a system which is not efficient in modern days. The refusal of the judiciary to cope up with the modern advancements and the rampant corruption prevailing in the offices of the judges is degrading the system.The Judges can only safeguard their titles of honourable or my lord if only they ensure that the public interests are safeguarded in a just manner. The judges are lawgivers and while pronouncing judgements should ensure that their hands are free of the blood of public goodwill and justice.REFERENCESHuchhanavar, Shivaraj. (2018).

    "headline": "An Overview on Anti- Hijacking ActKesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala: AnalysisSupreme Court Judge in TroubleWHETHER SUPREME COURT CAN INTERFERE IN THE PERSONAL LAWS?",
    "data": " This article is written by- Surbhi Kumari from Amity University Patna.IntroductionAircraft hijacking is the unlawful seizure of an Associate in Nursing craft by a personal or a bunch. In most cases, the pilot is forced to fly consistent with the orders of the hijackers. In 1982, the Associate in Nursing act was passed by the Parliament of India for suppression of unlawful seizure of aircraft registered in India and was referred to as the Anti-Hijacking Act, 1982. Consistent with the act, whoever on board craft on the wing tries by force or threats and intends to manage the craft for unlawful functions shall be charged with the offense to commit a hijack. The social control underneath such a charge, if proved, was imprisonment and fine.The increase within the variety of incidents of hijacking, increasing dangers against the protection of the flights of aircrafts presents grave issues before the international community and notably before the International Civil Aviation Organization. So as to unravel this drawback and penalise the hijackers, many Conventions are adopted.In Dec 1999, Associate in Nursing Indian Airlines craft popularly referred to as IC-814 was hijacked whereas movement on its method back to urban center from Kathmandu, Nepal. Despite many tries of negotiation with the hijackers, the Indian government was forced to unleash 3 terrorists specifically Maulana Masood Azhar, Ahmed Saeed ruler and Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar. One in every one of the passengers was killed whereas many others were injured . Later the case was investigated by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI), which charged ten individuals, of which seven individuals were absconding as well as the five hijackers. The 3 people that were charged with serving the hijackers were awarded life imprisonment.The Anti-hijacking Act, 2016Reforms within the Anti-hijacking Act, 1982 were given, and 1st brought up in 2010 but the amendments couldn’t see abundant daylight. It had been this year within the month of could once the Anti-hijacking modification Act was passed in each home with success additionally because it received the assent of the President. The Anti-hijacking Act, 2016 has been divided into 3 chapters mainly: the primary chapter deals with the definition of hijacking and different things like craft, hostage, military craft, etc. The second chapter deals with the social control for the defendant. The provisions of CRPC, 1973 have been permitted.Chapter-2 describes the powers of the central government. It conjointly defines the jurisdiction of the law.The 3rd chapter contains the miscellaneous provisions like the ability to treat bound craft to be registered in Convention countries. The persons acting in straightness and doing something needed underneath their duties. The new bill has an impact on The Hague Convention, 1971 and also the Peking Protocol, 2010. Some of the vital modifications within the new bill are;• Change in definition of the word “hijacking” The law currently defines hijacking as “Whoever unlawfully Associate in deliberately seizes or exercises management of an craft in commission by force or threat thence, or by coercion, or by the other style of intimidation, or by any technological means that, commits the offense of hijacking”Provision of execution and Role of Central Government• Change of jurisdiction of the law to “Universal”. Punishment:- Section 3(1) of the opposing Hijacking Act, 2016 defines the offence of hijacking as:• If hijacking results in death of a rider or a trained worker, it’s punishable with death. If not, the hijacking is punishable with imprisonment.• The Act of 2016 conjointly provides for fine and seizure of movable and immovable assets. The hijacker would even be charged with the other offence that takes place throughout the hijacking. It conjointly provides for detention in custody for up to thirty days, and a bail application won’t be pleased unless the general public attorney is given an opportunity to oppose it. If opposed, the court would need to be moderately happy that no offence of hijacking was committed.Critical AnalysisSignificance of the new act:• The new legislation could be a welcome move as Asian nations tighten their stand on handling hijacking incidents. Hijacking has become a major space of international aviation law inflicting nice concern globally.• India has shown its concern by changing its legislative machinery and by establishing combating hijacking.• This act was introduced for a lot of alerts for the protection and security of passengers just in case of hijacking. It’ll help to beat drawbacks of the prevailing crisis management system in handling cases of hijacking.• It proposes to allow powers to the agencies and force for stern action against those creating phone calls and distributing hoax threats.• Standing Committee had supported the supply to award death penalty to abettors and conspirators committing any act outlined as hijacking.• However, this committee had conjointly opined that if capital punishment was ensured for all hijacking offences, then the chance for negotiation or settlement to save lots of the lives of passengers would be closed. It had conjointly asked whether or not capital punishment would function deterrence to hijackers on suicide missions.Old Act vs. New Act• The key new introductions square measure the capital punishment, sentence for hoax calls, and a wider definition for craft “in service”.• Under the previous Act, associate craft was thought of “in service” between the time the doors shut and also the time each traveller had disembarked. Below the new Act, “a craft shall be thought of to be ‘in service’ from the start of the pre-flight preparation of the craft by ground personnel or by the crew for a selected flight till day when any landing”.• In case of aircraft landing, “the flight shall be deemed to continue till the competent authorities take over the responsibility for the aircraft”.• The new Act applies although the offence is committed outside India. However the craft is registered in India or chartered to Indians, or the wrongdoer is Indian, or the wrongdoer is homeless however lives in Asian nation (such as associate with an embezzled Bangladeshi migrant), or the offence is committed against Indians.Shortcomings• The Act of 2016 has some shortcomings. The term ‘aircraft’ is known as any craft, whether or not or not it’s registered in Asian nation. However it excludes associate craft that’s utilized in customs or police service that ought to are enclosed.• Provision to hide ‘hoax calls’ with proportionate penalization ought to be enforced. Hoax calls produce panic, leading to serious complications for passengers. They conjointly cause a nightmare for security agencies that find themselves wasting resources and time to verify the legitimacy of the decision.• Moreover, even the terms ‘hostage’ and ‘security personnel’ haven’t been outlined within the Act. The Act, as expressed on top of, solely prescribes a penalization with death wherever the offence of hijacking leads to the death of a prisoner or security personnel. Within the case of associate intervention, particularly associated armed intervention by security personnel, there’s an opening of the death of alternative persons and of import penalization has to be prescribed.• The Act conjointly doesn’t defend ground workers and security personnel at the landing field. Whereas associate craft is on the bottom or is being ready for departure, a prospective hijacker could commit an act of violence against the bottom personnel. In its current type, the Act defines the penalization for acts of violence connected with hijacking and covers solely violence against passengers or airline crew. It overlooks violence against ground workers or security personnel, that is equally necessary.• The Act ought to have even thought of providing extra-territorial standing or immunity from jurisdiction for the good thing about the passengers and also the crew within the state so that associate craft is also hijacked. This sort of rule, that ought to conjointly apply to any or all cases of unexpected landings in an exceedingly foreign country, is desperately required, notably within the event of the unlawful seizure of associate craft.ConclusionThe Anti-hijacking modification Act, 2016 covers a substantial quantity of enhancements compared to the act of 1982 or the amendments created in 1994. With the implementation of this act, the Indian legislation certainly tightens its stand against incidents associated with hijacking because it brings each technology and men to figure along a lot of watchfully for the protection of passengers. The new act has conjointly been framed by the Beijing Protocol, 2010 that makes it noted globally as several countries frame their civil aviation laws by this protocol.

    "headline": "WHETHER MINORS COMMITTING HEINOUS CRIMES SHOULD BE TREATED AS JUVENILE?Kulbhushan Case: Will ICJ rule in favour of India? Live Update#DO WE REALLY NEED SEDITION LAWS IN INDIA?DISCUSSION HOUR: DEMONETIZATION",
    "data": " INTRODUCTIONIn our society, when a minor commits heinous crimes, the best method and how to balance the punishment, justice and rehabilitation become more complex as compared to adults. When any terrible offence has been committed ineluctably many questions arise. According to our Juvenile Justice System, if a minor commits any crime then it is considered as an act of stupidity, or spirit of adventure or lack of teaching and morals. The Latin maxim “doli capax”, means the person incapable of creating an intention required to conduct a crime. The origin of the Juvenile Justice System first came into existence during the British era. The very first act enacted in India was Madras Children Act, 1920 and was followed in Bengal and Bombay in 1922 and 1924 respectively. After that, the minor was divided into two categories: delinquent and negligent children and by this idea minors kept in rehabilitation to transform their character, can be released with good character. Imprisonment when the nature of offences was heinous. There has been legislation over Juvenile System in India comprising “Apprentices Act 1850; The Reformatory School Act, 1976; Children Act 1980 etc and the most important one Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2000. Later amended in the year 2006 and 2015.WHO IS JUVENILE?Juvenile refers to a person who has not passed the age of 18 but above the age of 10 years. The term means a teenager, very young, underage, childish and immature. Sometimes “child” is also used in the place of “juvenile”.In a legal way, a Juvenile is a child who has not attained the certain age at which he would not be held accountable for any criminal act like an adult in the country. He/She is a person who committed an act or omission which is legally a violation of law but not declared as an offence. According to Juvenile Justice Act,2000, if a juvenile commits any crimes he should not be treated as an adult person when they commit crime and also not be tried in court of law for punishment.WHY JUVENILE INDULGE IN SUCH CRIMES OR ACTIVITIES?As per National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 60% of the crimes against minors in India are usually held between the age of 16 and 18 year, as of 2013. The rate has increased in recent years, and those crimes also included the modesty of women being outraged. Actually there are a number of reasons which contribute to youth criminal nature. There are certain reasons behind such crimes: Social reasons, Psychological reasons, and Economic reasons.Social ReasonsFamily, Bad Association, School, Criminal Areas, Social disorganization, War, Entertainment etcEconomic ReasonsPoverty, Family conflict, Starvation, Employment of children etcPsychological reasonsMental Disease, Personality Traits, Emotional instability etc.Crimes committed by the children of a specific age are called juvenile delinquency.JUVENILE JUSTICE (CARE AND PROTECTION) SYSTEM, 2000The Juvenile Justice Act, 2000 main objective is to provide protection for such children. Incident of “Delhi Gang Rape Case” literally frightful in which one of an offender was minor done the deadly crime. While the other criminals were sentenced to death, he was sentenced to a mere three years. After such an incident it compels everyone to think whether the minor, in this case, not mature enough as others, he is not “guilty mind” or incapable of forming “intention for committing such heinous crime.Nirbhaya case brings out certain amendments in the Juvenile Justice Act. On 31st December 2015, the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) System was implemented.MAJOR FEATURES OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE ACT, 2015To establish a Juvenile Justice Board in the entire district to deal and resolve the conflict children are going through, with the law.Raise composition and power of the Juvenile Justice Board.Open rehabilitation centre for delinquent juveniles, as envisaged in Preamble and Fundamental Principles.Section 12 (2) defines a child “a person who has not completed 18 years of age”. Two major heads of the children “child need proper care and protection” and “child in conflict with law.”Divided juvenile crime into categories: a) Petty, b) Serious, c) heinous.The Juvenile Board will comprise social experts and psychologists.ARE THE AMENDMENTS GOING TO STOP THE MENACE – A CRITICAL ANALYSISThe lawyer of Delhi High Court stated “by suggesting change in the juvenile justice system the Government has not done justice, the new juvenile law will not reform a juvenile but school him in crime. It is a serious deviation from the system of ‘parens patriae’, a doctrine that believes that the State is the parent of the nation”. After the pathetic incident, Delhi rape case (2012) and the Shakti Mills rape case, where minor was also one of the accused. The issue raises how to punish these juveniles, as in both the cases where others were sentenced to death, the juvenile was imprisoned for three year in remand home and got away. Then the question arises, how to punish enough to rectify a youth? How should the punishment be given to optimum positive result in changing the criminal characteristic and changing them?Many experts suggested giving them the most severe punishment, dealt with an iron fist, treated them as adults, if any juvenile about 16 committed a heinous crime, sent to jail bypassing the juvenile justice board. The expert feels that the object of Juvenile Justice Board is reformative justice not retributive justice.The three schools of thoughts have been pointed out:The first one is to reduce the age.The second one feels that the Government should not confer power to criticize children.The third one is that the Government has no right to interfere and only after inspection, a child is treated as an adult.STAND OF JUDICIARY ON SUCH CASESAfter the Delhi Rape Case (2012), one of the accused was juvenile and tried in Juvenile court. Seeking that in the year 2013, A BLP politician, Mr. Subramaniam Swamy filed a PIL in Supreme Court with a plea to try a juvenile accused in an ordinary court of law.On which a three judge bench rejected to interfere in the juvenile cases found with heinous crimes. It was held that the provision of the Act is in agreement with constitutional directives and international conventions. The Supreme Court transferred the case to Juvenile Justice Board, to make the best decision in which the board sent the juvenile to remand home for 3 years.This judgement of the Supreme Court was criticized by the victim’s mother along with the public, for not punishing the juvenile as an adult and remarked that the court gives a path to encourage a minor to commit such crime without any terror.After criticism, the Ministry of Women and Development made a draft, mention, the juvenile between 16 and 18 year of age should be treated as an adult if they committed any heinous crimes viz. Rape, robbery, murder etcMEASURES TO REFORM SUCH CHILDRENOnce a child is detected with some weird behaviour like frustration, aggressive etc, one must not reject the individual.Bring out positive change in society to encourage such behaviour.Inculcate a sense of affection, love and security among them.Parents should consult with children about their behaviour and detect early signs, it may help to destroy the tendency of criminal minds at the root.Implant a sense of social and moral values.REHABILITATION CENTRE FOR SUCH CHILDRENNumber of rehabilitation centres have been established for children who are in need of care and protection and in conflict with law. In these centres, the children are supplied with services of education, nutrition, treatment of disease, health, de-addiction, skill development, counselling etc. It will help them to build up their personality.CONCLUSIONThe statement is true “A child is the father of the man”. Whatever qualities build up in the child, will stay with them till the end. With bad qualities, we get such juvenile delinquency and vice-versa. There is no wrong in saying that every delinquent youth is a victim of a situation, no one is wrong since birth. It must be the responsibility and duty of each and every citizen of India whether as teacher, friends, parents, siblings and relatives, to guide them about right and wrong. It is for their betterment along with for the society as whole. It is important to remove bad from an individual, not an individual.

    "data": " This Article is written by Ishita Agrawal from Mody University of Science and TechnologyWhat is Conversion?The Ordinance characterizes transformation as denying one’s current religion and receiving another religion.The Ordinance tries to manage strict changes and disallows specific sorts of strict transformations (counting through marriages).Prohibition on ConversionsThe Ordinance restricts change of religion through implies, for example, (I) power, deception, unnecessary impact, and allurement, or (ii) misrepresentation, or (iii) marriage. It likewise disallows an individual from abetting, persuading, and contriving to such changes. The Ordinance relegates the burden of evidence of the legitimacy of strict change to the people causing or working with such transformations. In any case, an individual reconverting to his/her quick past religion is permitted.Marriages involving religious conversionUnder the Ordinance, a marriage is obligated to be pronounced void on the off chance that it was accomplished for the sole motivation behind unlawful transformation, or the other way around. In any case, a marriage including strict transformation is allowed if the change is gone through according to the system set down under the Ordinance.Procedure for ConversionThe Ordinance requires people (trying to change over) and strict converters (who perform such transformations) to present a development affirmation of the proposed strict change to the District Magistrate (DM).The statements must be given with a notification of:60 days by the personOne month by the convertor.On accepting both the statements, the DM is needed to direct a police enquiry into the expectation, reason, and reason for the proposed change.Punishments for causing Unlawful conversion:i) Imprisonment-Whosoever contradicts this law will look at any rate one-year detainment which might be stretched out to five years.Whosoever negates this law concerning minors, ladies or individuals having a place with SC or ST clan, will look at any rate two years prison term which might be stretched out to ten years.Whosoever contradicts this law regarding mass change, will look at any rate three years prison term which might be reached out to ten years. ii) Fine-People doing the restricted transformation will be obligated to pay Rs. 15,000 fines.Whosoever repudiates this law concerning minors, ladies or individuals having a place with SC or ST clans, will be at risk to pay Rs. 25,000 fines.Whosoever negates this law concerning mass transformation, will be responsible to pay Rs. 50,000 fines. iii) Compensation to the victim: The pay payable by the blamed to the casualty for the said transformation will be notwithstanding the fine and may reach out to Rs. 5 Lakh. iv) Offense by institution or organization:If any foundation or association disregards the arrangements of this law, the head of such association/foundation will confront a prison term referenced above and the enrollment of such association/organization will be dropped. Additionally, no monetary guide or award will be given to such an association/foundation by the State Government.The Ordinance accommodates discipline for causing or working with unlawful strict change. It likewise makes such a demonstration of transformation a non-bailable criminal offense.States that have anti-conversion lawsThe primary state to execute it was Odisha in 1967.This was trialed by Madhya Pradesh in 1968.Different states which have this law are Arunachal Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Gujarat, Himachal Pradesh, Jharkhand and Uttarakhand.Supreme Court on ConversionsWhile maintaining the legitimacy of the Freedom of Religion Acts of Madhya Pradesh and Odisha, in Stanislaus (1977), the Supreme Court had held that the “option to engender” a religion did exclude the “option to change over”. The Supreme Court said that the demonstration of strict proselytization isn’t ensured by Article 25 of the Constitution The Supreme Court of India, in both the Lily Thomas and Sarla Mudgal cases, has affirmed that strict transformations did without a true-blue conviction and for the sole motivation behind determining some lawful advantages don’t stand up to anything. Those cases concerned strict changes by Hindu men to Islam to close bigamous relationships. This methodology has additionally been affirmed by the high courts of different states. Observation made by the Courts in India on MarriageIn the Hadiya case, the Supreme Court dominated:“The option to wed an individual is fundamental to Article 21 (right to life and freedom) of the Constitution”.“The decision of an accomplice whether inside or outside marriage exists in the selective space of every person. Affections of marriage exist in a center zone of protection, which is sacred”.The Supreme Court held that an individual’s entitlement to pick a religion and wed is an inherent piece of her significant presence. Neither the State nor “male centric incomparability” can meddle in her choice.Allahabad High Court has said the option to live with an individual of one’s decision is characteristic for the privilege to life and individual freedom independent of religion.“The Courts and the Constitutional Courts specifically are ordered to maintain the life and freedom of an individual ensured under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Option to live with an individual of his/her choice regardless of religion declared by them, is characteristic for the right to life and individual freedom. Impedance in an individual relationship, would establish a genuine infringement into the privilege to opportunity of decision of the two people”.Why do we need such Law?The statute sets out a strategy to guarantee that any transformation starting with one religion then onto the next is just finished with free assent. The methodology is implemented to forestall transformations by unreasonable methods.It isn’t against a local area or a religion as no place in the law, involving 14 segments and three timetables, the terms ‘Hindu’, ‘Muslim’, ‘Christian’ or ‘Parsi’ or ‘strict larger part’ or ‘minority’ are utilized. It is similarly material to everybody independent of their religion or sex.The law would apply to individuals of all religions similarly and would boycott any sort of strict transformations for marriage. Advantages & DisadvantagesConversion from a faith like Hinduism, in which caste plays a pivotal position in religions like Islam and Christianity, which do not differentiate on the premise of caste, has each benefits and disadvantages.The advantages are pretty obvious and consist of freedom from the limitations imposed by society on the decreased castes that save them from realizing their authentic ability and limit their possibilities within the call of tradition and do not let them upward thrust from their lifestyles of poverty, deprivation, and exploitation.Conversion allows them to break free of the shackles that bind them to their distress and the sensation of being unworthy and lower than others, of being treated as 2nd-class residents and being made to hold on to menial work era after era without receiving any appreciation or reputation from society.However, conversion also has its disadvantages. Hindu Dalits that convert to other religions lose their affirmative motion benefits. They may be now not entitled to the seats reserved for them in authorities’ places of work and authorities funded academic institutions. Jobs and admissions granted to them under the quota will be taken lower back on conversion. Supporters of this coverage claim that considering the fact that their new religions are caste-much less there is no discrimination and therefore no inequity. These human beings are not at a drawback and consequently don’t want to assert these privileges.Uttar Pradesh freedom of Religion Act, 2019 (Draft)In 2019, the Uttar Pradesh State Law Commission under Justice Aditya Nath Mittal incorporated a report on unlawful strict changes and proposed a draft named ‘to give opportunity of religion by the restriction of transformation starting with one religion then onto the next by distortion, power, excessive impact, intimidation, allurement or by any false methods or by marriage and for the issue associated therewith or incidental thereto’.Uttar Pradesh Unlawful Religious Conversion Prohibition Ordinance, 2020It makes strict change for marriage a non-bailable offense and the onus will be on the respondent to demonstrate that transformation was not for marriage.The notification period to the District Magistrate for the strict change is two months.In the event of transformation done by a lady for the sole reason for marriage, the marriage would be proclaimed invalid and void.Infringement of the arrangements of the law would welcome a prison term of at least one year extendable to five years with a fine of Rs. 15,000.On the off chance that a minor lady or a lady from the Scheduled Caste (SC) or Scheduled Tribe (ST) changes over, the prison term would be at least three years and could be reached out to 10 years with a fine of Rs. 25,000.The mandate likewise sets down exacting activity, including dropping of enlistment of social associations directing mass changes, which would welcome a prison term of at least three years and as long as 10 years and a fine of Rs. 50,000.Whether the Government should regulate Religious Conversion?Supporters of Government intervention in religious conversions argue that the law handiest prohibits pressured conversions and does no longer save you voluntary conversion.Critics of Government interference counter those claims by way of pronouncing that religion being a non-public choice the country has no jurisdiction over spiritual freedom. Changing one’s faith is a private act that falls outside the ambit of governance. They also claim that the existing anti-conversion legal guidelines are ambiguous and open to misuse and are concerned with flagrant misuse of electricity through the authorities in charge of judging whether or not or no longer a conversion turned into forcible.First Arrest under Anti-Conversion Law21-year-old Uwaish Ahmed was captured in Bareilly against unlawful transformation in Uttar Pradesh. A FIR was stopped against him by Tikaram Rathore (an occupant of Sharifnagar town) in Deoria Police Station on charges of purportedly attempting to force a 20-year-old Hindu lady to change her over to his religion and wed him, The Hindu announced.Mr. Tikaram asserted that the accused had fostered a kinship with his little girl during their schooling and needed to ‘constrain, persuade and appeal her to change over.ConclusionUttar Pradesh Prohibition of Unlawful Conversion of Religion Ordinance, 2020, the point of view of it as a powerful protection against unlawful change, and separating the spaces of dispute against the recommendation of the equivalent, this paper has uncovered the requirement for its far-reaching execution. Sadly, in the mission for wokeness, it tends to be not difficult to unsee actuality-based truth and go against approaches established in the public interest. It is presently evident that the option to wed an individual voluntarily, right to protection are basic opportunities that can’t be limited excessively by the State and its instrumentalities. The judgment of the Allahabad High Court in Safiya Sultana v. the State of U.P. is consoling of this situation, as it held that if distribution of notice under the Special Marriage Act, 1954 welcoming issues with the marriage were to be required, they would attack the principal privileges of freedom and security, including inside its circle the opportunity to decide for marriage without obstruction from state and non-state entertainers. It will be fascinating to see whether the courts follow the milestone points of reference in managing the petitions testing the ordinances and shield the protected profound quality from being trammeled by evident cultural ethical quality.

    "headline": "ISRAEL PALESTINE CONFLICTCHILD AS A CONSUMER: PERSPECTIVE FROM LAW AND BEHAVIOURMarital Rape: Still RapeACID ATTACK: NATURE OF PROVISIONS SINCE THE DAY OF ITS EVOLUTION",
    "data": "This article is written by Anjaly Ann Joseph from Government Law College, Ernakulam.The conflict between Israel and Palestine is a lot more complex than what it seems on the surface and dates back to 1948, when the country of Israel was formed. To be able to completely comprehend the conflict it is necessary to understand the importance and significance of this piece of land. It does not take a lot to gather that this conflict is more than a mere territorial dispute. HISTORY OF ISRAEL PALESTINE CONFLICTJews were in occupation of this land from 1800 BCE and held ground there for more than 3000 years. After the Babylonian conquest many Jews began moving out, thereby beginning the Jewish diaspora. Jewish migration further intensified after the Roman Conquest in 63 BCE. After the destruction of temple at Jerusalem at 70 CE, the Jews lost their identity along with their symbolic structure. It was a watershed moment for the Palestinians, and resulted in large scale migration.The Ottoman Turks ruled Jerusalem and much of Middle East from 1516 to 1917, forming the Syrian Palestine. After First World War, the British captured the area. Whereas during middle ages, Jewish population immigrated to different countries, especially Europe and in the 19th century, the Jews were facing persecution from all these nations. Anti-Semitism reached its zenith during the fascist regime while the Zionist movement gained momentum among Jews and clamoured for a country of their own. Britain through the Balfour Declaration created the country of Israel. Soon after the establishment of Israeli Settlement in 1984, Arab states joined hands with Palestine leading to the First Arab-Israel War. With this there occurred mass migration of Palestinian nationals to nearby countries and with that, in 1964, Palestinian Liberation Organisation (PLO) was formed. In 1964, during the six day war, Israel captured East Jerusalem, West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights. These areas remain tumultuous even after decades. From 1987, Palestinians started revolting against Israel, which kickstarted the First Intifada. In 1993 the First Intifada was brought to a conclusion with a peace settlement between Israel and PLO. Unfortunately the September of 2000 witnessed the Second Intifada with the visit of Ariel Serron to the Al Aqsa mosque. The conflict zones were ravaged by the incessant attack and suicide bombing inflicted by the Palestine nationals. In retaliation, Israel captured West Bank. Fresh hope of peace sprung with the moderate leader Mohammed Abbas becoming the President of Palestine and in the following the Israel forces withdrew from the Gaza Strip; but as a thorn in the flesh, Hamas- a Palestinian fundamental organisation took control over Gaza Strip in 2007. Israel threatened by their extremist actions and restarted operation there from 2014. After 3 years of violence Hamas reached conciliation with the ruling party and consents to initiate democratic process. SHEIKH JARRAH EVICTIONThe recent escalation between Israel and Palestine is caused by the eviction proceeding against 13 Palestinian families in Sheikh Jarrah located in East Jerusalem. At the creation of Israel, Sheik Jarrah was mainly occupied by a Jewish community, but after the creation, Palestinians driven out of the Israeli settlement moved to Sheik Jarrah. It was captured by Jordan in the First Arab Israel war. Jorden, with the help of International organisations built homes in that area, which were occupied by Palestinian families. Later during the Six-day war, Israel recaptured East Jerusalem including Sheik Jarrah. After this, Israel authorities started demanding Palestinians to move out of Sheikh Jarrah. This year, the Central Court in East Jerusalem upheld the evictions of Palestinian families, which led to protest all over. There were attempts by Israel to barricade the protesters, which culminated in violent clashes on May 10. INTERNATIONAL LEGAL PERSPECTIVE AND HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONSMajor concerns centers around entitlement to territory, which is a source of self-determination to people. International legal principle of Uti possidetis is generally applied for ascertaining territory in newly formed nations. This principle states that “new states will come to independence with the same boundaries that they had when they were administrative units within the territory or territories of one colonial power.” As per this rule Israel has no legitimacy for its occupation of Gaza strip, West Bank and Golan Heights. Notorious human rights violations in this area includes forced displacement, unlawful killing, restrictions on freedom of movement and discriminatory policies. Either Palestinians were forcefully driven out or making it impossible for them to live by discriminatory policies. Meanwhile there has been an increase in Israeli settlements in the area. Palestinians are restricted movement and the Gaza Strip is nearly closed down in the name of security. Moreover ruthless killing of civilians including children and the scarcity of resources to sustain life accounts the brutal human rights crisis.Right to self-determination is supposed to includeRight to exist-territoriality and demographically -as a peopleRight to territorial integrityRight to permanent sovereignty over natural resourcesRight to cultural integrity and developmentRight to economic and social developmentPalestine repeatedly spoke of “the territorial sphere over which the Palestinian people are entitled to exercise their right of self‐determination.” The self determination of the Palestinian people will somewhat be fulfilled by the two state solution of creating an independent Palestine state. INTERVENTION OF INTERNATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICEIn 2002, when the second intifada was raging, Israel government decided to construct a separation wall in West Bank. Security was the main reason cited for the construction of this colossal wall. This created a closed space between the Green Line and the wall called the seam zone. It contains 42 Palestinian villages cut off from the rest of the land. A special permit is required to move in and out of the area.The matter came before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) and in 2004 by an Advisory opinion declared the construction illegal. It recommended that separation wall is against the International law and hence the construction is to be stopped and the existing wall is to be dismantled. Court cited the following reasons for its decision:-The wall may likely remain permanent which is against the prohibition on annexation of territory.The wall will create demographic changes in occupied territories in contravention to the Article 49(6) of Fourth Geneva Convention alongside Security Convention resolutions 446,452 and 465.As the wall goes around 80% of the settlements ,it will reinforce the illegality of transfer of population into occupied territory. Consequently, the wall will cause a fair share of Palestinians to live sequestered lives, cut off from the rest of the land.Wall is within Occupied Palestine and involves a destruction of public and private property.This wall causes restriction on freedom of movement of Palestinians, further inducing negative effects on agricultural production, economic development, healthcare services, education establishments and primary source of water.Palestinians’ right to choose residence protected under CRC, ICCPR and ICESCR is affected.Even though the Advisory opinions of the International Court of Justice is non-binding ,it is generally held in high regard and adhered to by the countries. However, in this case even after 16 years the separation wall still stands tall. CONCLUSIONApparently, every time the two nations get at loggerheads, the International community intervenes and prompts peace. Yet, a permanent solution to this problem should be realized at the earliest. The execution of the two state solution is the need of the hour. Meanwhile every possible attempt should be made to tackle humanitarian crisis and attack on civilians. Edited by Shivanshika Samaddar of National Law University Delhi. "

    "headline": "IS IT TIME THAT INDIA ABOLISHES DEATH PENALTY?Modi Government bans Rs 500 and Rs 1000 notes to curb corruption: AnalysisSHRI RAM JETHMALANI: AN EMINENT LAWYER AND GREAT POLITICIANThe Social Peril of Honour Killing",
    "data": " This article is written by Anjaly Ann Joseph from Government Law College, Ernakulam. INTRODUCTIONThere was a time in history when public hangings and guillotines were the most common methods of punishment. The general intention behind this was not just about punishing the perpetrator but it was about inducing fear and obedience in everyone who witnessed it. The brutal executions from the fascist regimes still haunts the memory of the people. Our country inherited this practice from our erstwhile colonial masters, who were known for notorious capital punishments; from having 222 offences including impersonation and damaging of Westminster Bridge that could attract capital punishment to decapitating even the queen of the country, it is an undeniable fact that British history is incomplete without capital punishment. However when they employed this practice in India it was their display of authority and a means to evoke submission in our countrymen, but meanwhile it interesting to know that Britain today have jointed the league of abolitionist nations of death penalty. Yet much to the regret of many, India has not liberated itself capital punishment. JURISPRUDENCE BEHIND DEATH PENALTYIt was the political philosopher Thomas Hobbes who defined punishment as “an evil inflicted by a public authority on him that has done, omitted which is judged by the same authority to be a transgression of the law”. Maintaining social order and peace is the main purpose behind punishment. Different theories of punishment clarifies different perspectives to punishment such as preventive, deterrent, retributive and reformative are the major approaches to punishment.Preventive Theory: Focuses on prevention of crime by the disablement of the offender by impersonation, exile etc. The basic proposition behind this theory is “not to avenge for the crime but to prevent it”.Deterrence Theory: Focuses on the role of punishment as to deter the wrongdoer from repeating the offense and a potential wrongdoer from committing a crime.Retributive Theory: Works on the principle “Eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth”. It focuses on avenging the criminal for the harm they have committed.Reformative Theory: Primarily deals with reforming the offender and bringing them back to the society as a better person. This approach to punishment is gaining momentum and we have brought in new initiatives like open prison to facilitate rehabilitation.Death penalty serves both the purposes of retribution and deterrence. Capital punishment is traditionally seen as way by which the state and society vent their revenge on the offender and it also serves as an example for the potential offenders thereby deterring them. INTERNATIONAL PERSPECTIVESDeath Penalty is not prohibited to any International Treaty so far, but the matter given to its gravity was touched upon in various conventions. International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) is the most important treaty relating to death penalty.Article 6 of the ICCPR states:“1. Every human being has the inherent right to life. This right shall be protected by law. No oneshall be arbitrarily deprived of his life.2. In countries which have not abolished the death penalty, sentence of death may be imposedonly for the most serious crimes in accordance with the law in force at the time of thecommission of the crime and not contrary to the provisions of the present Covenant and to theConvention on the Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide. This penalty canonly be carried out pursuant to a final judgement rendered by a competent court.3. When deprivation of life constitutes the crime of genocide, it is understood that nothing in thisarticle shall authorize any State Party to the present Covenant to derogate in any way from anyobligation assumed under the provisions of the Convention on the Prevention and Punishmentof the Crime of Genocide.4. Anyone sentenced to death shall have the right to seek pardon or commutation of the sentence.Amnesty, pardon or commutation of the sentence of death may be granted in all cases.5. Sentence of death shall not be imposed for crimes committed by persons below eighteen yearsof age and shall not be carried out on pregnant women.6. Nothing in this article shall be invoked to delay or to prevent the abolition of capitalpunishment by any State Party to the present Covenant.” Customary law put forward several pre requisites of imposing death penalty like right to fair trial and right to seek pardon and commutation of sentence. It also mandates that capital punishment should be limited to serious offences only. Along with this, International Organisations are pushing for abolition of the same and till date more than two third of the countries have abolished death penalty in law and practice. DEATH PENALTY IN INDIA; DOCRINE OF RAREST OF RARE CASESCapital punishment in India is limited to most serious and heinous offences. This method of restricted death penalty to rarest of rare cases was laid down by Supreme Court in the case of Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab. The constitutional bench of Supreme Court by a majority of 4:1, explicitly declared death penalty constitutional and crafted the said doctrine of restricting it to rarest of the rare cases when there is no other alternative option left. In Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab, Supreme Court laid down the test for finding rarest of the rare cases. The pointers include the way of commission, nature of the homicide, ruthlessness and gravity of the crime and rationale behind the commission. In Santhosh Kumar Bariyar v. State of Maharashtra, it was laid down that life imprisonment is the rule and death penalty is the exception. The issue before court was the validity of section 303 of Indian Penal Code, which mandates death penalty for all offenders serving life imprisonment. Ultimately, the Court struck down this section as unconstitutional. Even after forty one years ,the ratio laid down in the Bacchan Singh case continues to prevail and the courts have shown no inclination to re-examine the rarest of rare doctrine. ‘COLLECTIVE CONSCIENCE’ IN DEATH PENALTYHeinous and barbaric crimes that shock the nation are followed by public outcry for capital punishment or instant justice. More often than not, death penalty is demanded for the sake of collective conscience of society. While diverging to that claim, it is worthy to note that capital punishments to Nirbhaya convicts and instant revenge on Disha incident have not stopped rape. However even courts have turned to the collective conscience doctrine, while imposing death penalty. Well, people advocating death penalty on the basis of collective conscience is one issue and court pandering to these calls ignoring the individual right is another. Now, courts are presented with two options; it can side with majoritarian barbarism or choose ‘justice’, in every sense of the word. CONCLUSIONMore than 700 people were hanged in our country after Independence. Recently, we have seen a surge of offenders convicted with capital punishment, especially in UP with 404 criminals on death row. Most probably, punishment for a good share of them will be reduced to life imprisonment. However these numbers are still alarming ,as the time has passed to quit ourselves from this savage mode of punishment. Many countries have laid the path for us and it is time for Indian judiciary to pursue it .“Justice is not only the way we punish those who do wrong. It is also the way we try to save them.”-Gregory David Roberts, Shantaram REFERENCESBachan Singh v State of Punjab AIR 1980 SC 898Machhi Singh v State of Punjab (1983) 3 SCC 470Santhosh Kumar Bariyar v State of Maharashtra (2009) 6 SCC 498 Curated by Shivanshika Samaddar of National Law University, Delhi.

    "headline": "Black Marketing of Medicines During PandemicFemale Genital Mutilation: A Curse to HumanityAn Overview on Anti- Hijacking ActROLE OF COLLEGIUM SYSTEM IN PROTECTING  THE DEMOCRACY ?",
    "data": "This article is written by Sanya Solanki, a student of ILS, Pune.The pandemic has had some catastrophic effects on the working of many sectors of the society. But not all sectors were negatively affected. With its onset, it has only provided a booming ground for the illicit economy of medicine. The country has seen a surge in the illegal trade of pharmaceutical drugs for a period of two years now.One of the drugs that has been making headlines recently was the antiviral medicine, developed by Gilead Sciences called Remdesivir. Remdesivir is one of the government-approved, prescription-based drugs. The substantial rise in cases, the lack of supply, and the failure of a proper health care system has only added fuel to the rampant practices of illegal trade of Remdesivir.A single vial is being sold for almost ten times its retail price. But doctors recommend at least six vials administered to a critical patient for the medication to work. This means that the drug touts sell these prescription-based drugs for inflated prices and profit off people’s desperation.This is not the first time unfair trade practices of pharmaceutical drugs have come to light. Last year, an injection known as tocilizumab that was administered only to patients with deteriorating oxygen levels was sold for three times its listed price.Medicines were not the only things subjected to black marketing. In 2020 we also saw a rise in hoarding and illicit trading of essential commodities such as the infamous N95 masks.Ineffective yet wantedA matter of contention here is the effectiveness of the medicines. There is no evidence that the above-mentioned medicines have any effect on the progression of the disease. Even the N95 masks failed to prove their effectiveness.According to the World Health Organization, Remdesivir should only be injected in severe cases. A home isolated patient does not require this medication. Regardless, clinicians and doctors continue to prescribe remdesivir and it is still widely used in the country.The failure of the central drug authorities to update their guidelines and the sheer lack of awareness among people were a few important factors that led to the spur of demand for these drugs.Supply chainsIt was also disconcerting to watch how strong the supply chains run. With the help of the internet and the right connections, it is easy to obtain medications as and when needed. Moreover, several distributors give a certain portion of the shipment to pharmacies because they need those records on their books, but the rest of the stock is given to people who are a part of the inner circle. Strong connections and lack of any punitive measures have only encouraged the suppliers. The repercussions the market brings alongThese drug suppliers have perfectly exploited the gap of demand and supply by selling drugs at exorbitant prices. They’ve easily profited off misinformed and distressed people who have turned to the market as they see it as their only gleam of hope. Hence, it is fair to infer that these activities are not only legally wrong but also morally reprehensible.Apart from being ethically iniquitous, the illegal trade of pharmaceutical drugs also has grave health consequences. There is no way to test the genuineness of the medicines. People could procure counterfeit drugs that could impose severe risks to public health.The responsibility of societyBefore everything slips out of hands the responsible authorities need to take urgent and sustained measures to curb this menace. They need to step up and narrow this gap of demand and supply, ensure adequate health care and make sure everyone receives the proper treatment and medicines on time and keep updating guidelines regarding the utility of medicines.But it is not just the responsibility of the authorities. We, as responsible citizens must educate ourselves about the drugs we’re obtaining and ensure that we’re paying a fair price for them. People should be aware of the consequences of getting involved with the activities in the black market and try to be away from it as much as possible.ConclusionIt is appalling to watch grief-struck, misinformed people being exploited in the name of treatment. In this grim situation where panic and misery clouds the country, it is important to keep our composure and battle the virus and everything it brings along.

    "headline": "LAW OF GUARDIANSHIP IN INDIA AS PER DIFFERENT RELIGIONSCENTRE ISSUES GUIDELINES FOR DELIVERY OF ESSENTIAL GOODS THROUGH E-COMMERCEPROVISIONS UNDER WHICH INDIA CAN EVACUATE ITS CITIZENSThe Vulnerability of Data: A Look at Data Breaches and the Statutory Framework in India",
    "data": "The article is written by Robin Kumar Thakur from Chanakya National Law University. Guardianship in law means acquiring the legal authority to take decisions for someone else who is incapable of taking care of themselves due to infancy, insanity or disability. The legal guardians are vested with the authority of looking after the personal as well as financial aspects of the ward.GUARDIANSHIP UNDER HINDU LAWThe Hindu minor and Guardianship act of 1956 defines a minor as a person who has not completed the age of 18 years. Here it is understood that the minor is physically as well as mentally not fit to take his own decisions.Section 6 of the Hindu Minority and Guardianship Act 1956, deals with natural guardians of a minor Hindu child. Only three people are considered to be the natural guardian of a minor: husband, father and mother. Section 6(a) states that the guardianship of a minor until 5 years will be vested in the hands of the mother. Section 6(b) says that the mother is the sole natural guardian in case of an illegitimate minor, even if the father is still alive. In the case of a legitimate child, the mother can only become guardian after the death of the husband, or his inability to become a guardian.Testamentary Guardians: As the word, ‘testamentary’ itself suggests, these guardians are appointed in a will or testament of the natural guardians. In Section 9(1) it is mentioned that the father has the right to appoint the testamentary guardians for his children. Section 9(2) says that after the father’s death the mother will be the guardian of the minor and the will of the father will only be entertained if the mother dies without appointing her testamentary guardian.In the case of Sundaramurthy v. Shanmuganadar,it was held that no one else has the power to appoint the testamentary guardian of a minor except the parents. The guardian can choose to accept the guardianship, but once acknowledged it can not be revoked unless the court decides otherwise.Guardians Appointed By Courts: In section 13 of the Hindu minority and guardianship act of 1956, it is in the hands of the court to appoint or revoke any person as the guardian of the minor citing the welfare of the child.Defacto Guardian: Defacto guardian has not been described in any statute but the courts have always recognised it. Defacto guardian is a person who has consistently shown interest in the welfare of the minor in person as well as his property. There is no legal authority vested in the hands of the defacto guardian but he has assumed the responsibility for the welfare of the minor by himself.Guardian By Affinity: Usually, the guardianship by affinity is for the minor widow. The guardianship is given to someone within the degree of sapinda. Here it is to be noted that the minor’s welfare comes first, so the guardian must meet all the needs and provide safety to the minor to be a guardian.GUARDIANSHIP UNDER MUSLIM LAWThe roots of guardianship in Muslim law can be traced back to the Quran and various hadidts. Under Muslim law there exist three types of guardians:Natural guardian: The Muslim law regards the father as the only natural guardian . The muslim law gives him the right to preside over all the matters related to the ward even if the custody of the ward is being enjoyed by someone else. In the case of Imambandi v. Mutsaddi the privy council had held that the father is the sole and supreme guardian of the minor in his lifetime.Testamentary guardian: Muslim law provides the right to appoint a testamentary guardian only to the father. In Shias, after the death of the father, the grandfather becomes the guardian and if he appoints another testamentary it supersedes the testamentary guardian appointed by the father. Whereas in Sunnis, after the father’s death the executor of the testament becomes the guardian of the ward.In both the sects of the Muslim law mother does not enjoy much rights. They can only appoint the testamentary guardian for their children only if they have been chosen as an executor in their fathers will or has some property to her name, which will be inherited by the minor.Guardian appointed by the court: The guardians and wards act of 1890 governs the appointment of the guardian of the child for any group or religion by considering the child’s best interests.GUARDIANSHIP UNDER CHRISTIAN LAWThe law of guardianship in Christian law is governed by The Guardians and Wards Act of 1890 which is more or less secular in nature. According to section 17, the guardian must look after the health of the minor. It also notes that sex, age, faith and desire of the parents, the minors wish if he is old enough must be taken in to consideration while giving guardianship to anyone. Section 19 mentions that the court has no power to appoint any other guardian if the husband or the father is fit to be the guardian.CONCLUSIONThe children being the future of the nation need to be nurtured and well treated. Their mind as well as their character is in the preliminary stage of development and is subject to the mentoring and the environment provided to it by the Guardian. They also need someone to satisfy their basic needs, so the law must take utmost precaution before deciding the guardian. The well being of the child should be of the utmost importance.REFERENCESPatrick Olivelle (). Dharmasutras: The Law Codes of Ancient India, 110, Oxford University Press.

    "data": " This Article is written by Ishita Agrawal from Mody University of Science and Technology. IntroductionMaternity as the name recommends is the advantage that each lady is qualified to get as an installment which is payable to her by the business in her genuine nonattendance over the span of work.Ladies all over the world have heaps of duties and need to go through specific things like pregnancy, youth, monthly cycle and so forth. It might happen that she needs to leave her place of employment to deal with different things. Maternity Benefit Laws are subsequently made to help women so they can proceed to work and receive the rewards.The principal maternity advantage enactment was made by the State of Bombay in the year 1929. After this few different states made comparative laws and soon a need was felt to make a focal enactment for ladies and afterward ‘Maternity Benefit Act 1961′ appeared with the goal that disparity between the various Acts can be diminished.Objectives and need for Maternity Benefit Laws in IndiaThe most central reason for the maternity advantage laws is to ensure the respect of parenthood and Mothers, and to defend her and her kid’s well being. Parenthood is the most delightful time in any womens’ life and it’s her entitlement to appreciate it and give appropriate consideration to her kid having no concerns identified with the security of her work.Further the proportion of working ladies in the metropolitan area has expanded amazingly and there is a need to make a sexual orientation amicable work market giving a hopeful and an empowering climate and, in this manner, it was normal to ensure the ladies in her maternity seeing an enormous number of female representatives.Maternity Benefit Laws under Indian ConstitutionThere are a few laws under the constitution of India that defend and secure the privileges of ladies. Under Article 14 – correspondence of the sex is specified, while Article 15 accommodates uniformity in business, Article 39(a) orders equivalent compensation for equivalent work Article 42 specifies option to simply and altruistic states of work and maternity alleviation which is a DPSP and under the equivalent under Article 46 it is expressed that state should make rules for development in work openings and states of the functioning ladies.Article 15(3) enables the public authority to make extraordinary laws for the ladies and under which it passed the ‘Maternity advantage Act’.Aside from this ‘Indian Labor Organization’ have made certain guidelines on maternity benefits where the major concern is to give social and affordable security to the ladies representatives and guarantee that no danger is presented to her and her youngster in any capacity. The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017The Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 (Act) got the consent of the President on 27 March 2017 and was informed with impact from 28 March 2017. The Act manages the work of ladies when the introduction of their youngster and accommodates maternity benefits. This applies to every one of the plants, mines, shops and different foundations.Maternity benefits in basic words mean paying ladies representatives for the time of her genuine nonappearance from work during pregnancy. Coming up next are the notable highlights of the revision identified with the length and materialism of maternity leave and different offices to be given by the business after the introduction of the kid:Maternity leaves accessible to working ladies has been expanded from 12 weeks to 26 weeks for the initial two kids. This maternity advantage ought not be benefited before about two months from the date of anticipated conveyance.Maternity leave for the third kid onwards will keep on being 12 weeks.Maternity leave of 12 weeks is needed to be made accessible to moms embracing a kid underneath the age of a quarter of a year just as to the ‘dispatching mother’. Dispatching mother has been characterized as the organic mother who utilizes her egg to make an incipient organism which is then planted in another lady.All foundations with an overabundance to give crèche offices to working moms. They will be allowed to cause four visits during working hours to care for and feed the kid in the crèche.The business may allow a lady to telecommute if the idea of work licenses them to do as such.Each foundation will be needed to suggest every one of the advantages accessible under the Act, recorded as a hard copy and electronically, to all ladies at the hour of their underlying arrangement. In case of J.Sharmila vs The secretary to Government on 19 October, 2010The Madras High Court has decided that if a functioning woman brings forth twins in her first conveyance, she won’t be qualified for maternity benefits in case of an ensuing conveyance. This implies, in the event that she brings forth another child after twins in her first conveyance, the kid will be treated as the third kid. As of now, a functioning lady can profit from maternity benefits just for her initial two conveyances.Key Takeaways:The primary seat including of Chief Justice A P Sahi and Justice Subramonium Prasad in Madras High Court decided that a functioning lady won’t be qualified for maternity benefits in the subsequent conveyance on the off chance that she conveys twins during her first conveyance.According to the current standards, a functioning lady is qualified to get the maternity benefits just for her initial two conveyances.On account of twins, there is some delay between the successive births and the lady, at any rate, needs to convey twice. This adds up to two conveyances and consequently the kid after this will be viewed as a third kid.Second Delivery After Twins in First to Be Comprehended as Third“According to existing guidelines, a lady can profit from such advantages just for her initial two conveyances. Indeed, even else it is questionable with respect to whether the conveyance is anything but a second conveyance yet a third one, while normally when twins are conceived, they are conveyed consistently, and their age and they’re between se old status is additionally controlled by righteousness of the hole of time between their appearances, which adds up to two conveyances and not one synchronous demonstration,” the court said.For a lady representative to be qualified for maternity leave, she ought to have finished 80 days of working in the association where she is looking for the benefits. The Maternity (Amendment) Bill 2017 has expanded the prior 12 weeks’ leave to 26 weeks.This decision occurred after an adjudicator had given a CISF lady worker 180 days of maternity leave under the guidelines administering the Tamil Nadu state government. The Ministry of Home Affairs had gone against that and said that since she is an individual from CISF, her maternity advantages ought to be as per the Central Civil Services rules and Tamil Nadu state governments. I get that the demonstration says that maternity leave applies for the initial two children, I feel that it is fairly imperfect. Regardless of whether a woman had twinned the first occasion when, it was only one pregnancy and one time profiting of the maternity benefits. Since the maternity leave is principally for pre and post conveyance care, it ought to be founded on pregnancy and not the quantity of kids conceived. Likewise, is the lady expected to join work following bringing forth the third kid? This has neither rhyme nor reason. The time and work responsibility from a mother isn’t decreased on the grounds that this is her third kid. ConclusionI’d like to conclude that each lady has a privilege to live with nobility and profit from certain advantages for the total and solid upkeep of herself and her child in any event, when she isn’t working. With the coming and progress in the current time there has been a vigorous development in the quantity of working ladies’ representatives in the association and henceforth depending on maternity leave and different advantages is in a hurry. The key plan incorporates: Every lady will be qualified for, and her manager will be at risk for making an opportune installment of maternity advantage which is payable for the time of her genuine nonappearance at the pace of the normal day by day wage so decided. There is a need to authorize maternity benefits so a lady is to have the option to give a quality living to her child without stressing over whether she will lose her employment and her type of revenue.

    "data": " This article is written by Ritika Srivastava, The ICFAI University, DehradunIntroductionThere are certain sections in the society which remain unrecognized by the state viz. Asylum seekers, refugees, undocumented migrants (non- citizens of India). These people are framed as illegal migrants, who ran from their respective countries (endangered) but yet not accepted. Despite living in India for several years, many of them didn’t have proper documents to show their identity, also far from governmental schemes. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), statistics is maintained for seeking the number of asylum seekers and refugees fled to India and also protecting such migrants and refugees from Myanmar and Afghanistan, along with the government. It has been a tradition going on for several years, to host refugees from South-Asian subcontinents and beyond certain refugees from Tibet and Sri Lanka, itself facilitated and protected by the Indian Government.As per the sources of 2019, the estimated number of refugees is about 195,103 in India which is only officially reported. Refugees are no doubt ‘foreigners’ but in many cases they are distinguished with ‘foreigners’. There is no specific law to deal with them, they are dealt with common Indian law. UNHCR generally plays a vital role along with the government, especially regarding verification of their background and country origin. India is not a signatory to the 1951 Refugee Convention or its 1967 Protocol, and has consistently chosen to not enact a national asylum framework.Do refugees and asylum seekers fall under the criteria fixed by the government for registration to get vaccinated?The Covid-19 vaccination India had started from January 16, 2021. The process of vaccination is further divided into several phases. In the very first phase, it includes the frontline workers and healthcare people and in the second phase it included the people who are above the age of 45 years, and very recently it began for the age group above 18 years. Earlier this process of vaccination was started on the basis of data as mentioned in the voter’ list but this process would not continue for so long, but still people needed some identity proof to get vaccinated. Aarogya Setu and Covid-19 Vaccine Intelligence Network (CoWIN), these are the two apps through which a person gets registered for vaccination but there is also a requirement of Identity details in order to show that you are a citizen of India.The registration process is done on these apps, it is also compulsory to provide one of the seven identity cards which includes Aadhar Card, Driving License, Pan Card, Passport, Pension Pass Book, NPR Smart Card and Voter ID CardRefugees do not have any identity cards to get registered to get vaccinated, thereby making the process exclusionary especially for them only. They are totally eliminated from this whole process. This is not from day; they are always excluded from any basic amenities. The government did not even talk about their inclusion in the process of vaccination. This method of making registration mandatory raises lots of questions. As per the sources, the vaccine is already limited due to dense population. Due to lack of documents they did not even get to register.Process of vaccine includes only the citizens of India, who have basic documentation but they are considered as non-citizens or illegal migrants and this is the major disadvantage for them. Lack of documentation builds a primary problem in front of them, which is facing in the way of Covid-19 vaccination. UNHCR recognized them but they are not recognized by Indian Government and only UNHCR might hold the Certificate of Asylum Seekers and Refugees.How to make Refugees and Asylum Seekers vaccinatedIn the month of February, the United Kingdom government took the first initiative to vaccinate their refugees and asylum seekers despite of proper documentation, considering this as their legal right as they contribute to raise the economy of the country, some other countries viz. European Unions, German also stepped out to protect their asylum seekers in order to control the spread of Covid-19.Due to Covid-19 each and every section of the society is affected, but there are certain vulnerable section who faced this, both economically and socially, asylum seekers, undocumented migrants, refugees. These sections generally belong to the poor class, earn 500-700 daily to support their family, but now they are unable to find any work. Most of them dwell in places and surroundings that don’t allow them to socially distance themselves. Because of their economic condition, they have lack of medical care, personal hygiene and awareness regarding the virus.The drive of ongoing vaccination in Indian is only open for the citizens of India, who fit under the categories of their registration process. And the remaining groups are still eliminated because of lack of documentation.This is the perfect chance for the Indian government to widen their goodwill by vaccinating asylum seekers and refugees. Such a step would be considered a sincere humanitarian action by the Indian government and could alleviate its image within the international community. India should recognize the document which is issued by the UNHCR to asylum seekers and refugees. The UNHCR had revised its appeal early this year, asking countries to roll out vaccines for refugees, stateless persons and undocumented migrants. The UNHCR has also advocated for the inclusion of displaced persons and migrants as part of the national vaccination strategy.Indian government should also start vaccinating these sections and inclusion of them can stop the spread or virus up to some extent. This is the only way to ensure the safety of all because it is the duty and responsibility of the government to secure each and every individual of the country because no one is safe until and unless everyone is safe.In the case, State of Punjab & ors v. Mohinder Singh Chawla, Supreme Court held it is a duty of the state to maintain and provide health services to all the people residing in there, made it mandatory to vaccinate them and include Right to Health under Ar. 21 of the Indian Constitution.ConclusionThis widespread of coronavirus breaks everyone either mentally or economically, whether it is citizens or refugees. But citizens have some sort of relief as they are provided with all the governmental policies. Despite of residing in India for several, they are helpless and eliminated from covid-19 vaccination processInternational Organisation for Migration (IOM) Director General Antonio Vitorino stated:“Access to health is a fundamental right, but too often still, those who need it the most – including migrants and forcibly displaced persons – are left out. If 2020 has taught us something, it is that ill health is a universal issue that does not distinguish based on nationality; so, to be truly effective, neither should our health coverage, including in upcoming COVID-19 vaccination efforts.

    "data": "This article is written by- Surbhi Kumari from Amity University Patna.IntroductionThe term comes from the Latin word ‘obscaena’ which suggests offstage or a cognate to the traditional Greek root term skene. This can be as a result of some probably offensive content, like sex or murder, was pictured offstage within the classical drama. The term obscenity is dynamic in nature, because it perpetually varies with the passage of your time and from nation to nation. It depends upon the standards of morality of the latest societies around the world. The future result of obscenity within the society has resulted in corrupting the thought method .Obscenity may be thought of as any act or statement that powerfully offends the current ethical standards of the society. The term may be outlined as any image, video, photograph, write -up, figure, article etc. or a public act that depraves or corrupts the mind and that appeals to the salacious interests of the society or that is against the appropriate social ethical standards.History of ObscenityIn European country it had been regulated by one statute and in additional than one domain, it’s slightly be musing that the draft of the IPC, ready by indian Law Commission headed by Thomas Babington historiographer and submitted to the Governor-General of India Council in 1837, talked of obscenity narrowly, just as AN insult to the modesty of a lady.In 1857, the Obscene Publications Act 1857 was passed by the national parliament, and 3 years later the IPC came into effect in the country. Not like the 1837 draft, the IPC that was finally implemented. AN offence under this section is punishable, on 1st conviction, with imprisonment which can extend up 2 years with a fine of RS 2000.Tests of obscenityMiller checkMiller check was 1st applied by the USA, Miller v. Golden State. In this case, Melvin Miller mail-clad 5 unsure prospects to the manager which contained noticeable pictures of men and girls engaged in numerous sexual activities. once the manager browsed the mail, he filed the case of Obscenity against Mr. Miller for violating the Golden State Law.There are 3 elements of the Miller test:The average person, implementing the up to date community standards, would realize that a job, taken as a full, appeals to the salacious interest.Whether the work depicts or describes, during a plainly offensive approach, sexual conduct specially outlined by the applicable state law.The work, taken as a full, wanting serious literary, artistic, political or scientific. The work is taken into account obscene on condition that all 3 conditions are fulfilled. Hicklin checkThis check is a legal check for obscenity came from the case Regina v. Hicklin.This check is extremely liberal, during this check The Henry Scott, United Nations agency resold copies of anti-catholic pamphlets entitled “The booth Unmasked”, showing the befoulment of the papistic profession, the iniquity of the booth and the queries place to females confession. Once the pamphlets were ordered as obscene, Benjamin Hicklin, the administrative official who was to blame for such orders as recorder, revoked the order of extermination. Hicklin commanded that Scott’s purpose had not been to corrupt public morals however to expose the foremost problems associated with the Catholic Church; Scott’s intention was innocent. Lord Chief Alexander Cockburn, writing for the court of Queen’s bench, a broad definition of obscenity, supported ascertaining “whether the tendency of the matter is to change and corrupt those whose minds are receptive to such immoral influences and into whose hands a publication of this kind could fall”.Community standards checkThis check applied in india. It says that the art or any sign is obscene on condition that the theme is against society.Anti-Obscenity Laws in indiaThe Indian penal code, 1860 Section 292 & 293 prohibit publication and sale of obscene books, pamphlets that are deemed to be ‘lascivious or appeals to the salacious interests’, which embody obscene advertisements.Section 294 prohibits obscene acts and songs.Indecent representation of women (Prohibition Act), 1986Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008Section 67(A) says that a publication of sexual content on a social media website causes social control.National Human Rights Commission Section 2(d) of Act, protects the dignity of women in advertisements with the State Human Rights Commission.CASE LAWAveek Sarkar vs. State of West Bengal .In this case a German Magazine revealed a photograph of Boris Becker, a celebrated jock, sitting nude along with his bride-to-be Barbara Feltus, AN actor covering her breasts along with his hand.

After this, a criticism was filed against the newspaper underneath Section 292 of IPC. However, the SC held that the half-nude image of Boris Becker along with his bride-to-be wasn’t obscene, once applying the community normal check, and therefore the reason is that the image isn’t obscene as a result of it didn’t excite sexual passion or to change or corrupt minds of individuals. Ranjeet D. Udeshi v. State of Maharastra.In this case, Ranjeet D. Udeshi is the owner of the store.

    "headline": "RELATIONAL CONTRACT :Time for Legal Recognition in IndiaWHERE IS THE LINE OF HUMANITY WHEN ONE IS A PRISONER?SURROGACY LAWS IN INDIAABETMENT AND CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY – THE DIFFERENCE",
    "data": " This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida. RELATIONAL CONTRACT THEORYThis theory was originally conceived in the United States of America, guided by the intellect of learned legal savants Stewart Macaulay and Ian Roderick Macneil. It is characterised by the view that contracts are not only discrete but relational as well, i.e., contracts in which the expectations of both parties are not inked down in thorough detail but it develops subsequently as the relation progresses. This relationship between the parties is based on trust and has its roots in bona fide intentions towards one another. This theory stipulates that the beginning and end of some contracts are progressive and develop further based on user interaction and the unseen future.RELATIONAL CONTRACTRelational contract is a special category of contract, entered into by the parties for their mutual benefit. It involves a high degree of cooperation, communication, loyalty and is deeply rooted in transparency, trust and good faith. These contracts contain an implied obligation on both parties to not engage in any action which may lead to its frustration. This type of contract is very useful for securing long term mutual goals in order to keep the parties’ interests and desiderata aligned. Relational contracts are executed in cases where the relationship between the parties is to last 10-15 years or more and all conditions of service cannot be presumed at the onset.EVOLUTION OF RELATIONAL CONTRACTSTechnically, the concept of relational contracts was birthed in 1889 in the English Court by Lord Bowen under the test of ‘business efficacy’. It was in 2013 that the concept of ‘duty of good faith’ was recognised as a mechanism of cooperation between contracting parties by the English Courts in the much-discussed case of Yam Seng. This implied duty conveys a shift from the traditional view and brings forth a general doctrine of duty of good faith. The Court framed nine characteristic features which will help categorise contracts under the relational contract species. The Queen’s Bench in this precedential decision of Bates v. Post Office Ltd. directed that a duty of good faith encompasses not just honest actions but also, a restrain on certain conducts which are commercially substandard and may prove fatal to the achievement of the purpose of contract.LEGAL RECOGNITION IN INDIARelational contracts find no mention or provision under any Indian acts of the legislature, nor any jurisprudential reference. Stepping into the sphere of relational contract terms, the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 1976 observed that parties should adopt a common-sense approach to execution of contracts rather than a bland legalistic reading of the terms which may lead to widening the prospects of unconscionability. Using the theory of ‘business efficacy’ supra the Indian courts in the matter of Nabha Power Limited v. Punjab State Corporation recognised the principle of good faith implied in relational contracts through Penta Principles. These five guidelines include being reasonable and equitable, providing business efficacy to contracts, the Officious Bystander Test, clear expression through terms and that there should exist no express contradiction or violation of explicit conditions central to the execution of the contract. The court also observed that the intention and bona fide attitude of both the parties should be assessed before application of these principles, reinforcing the jurisprudential practice of not employing implied terms into a contract unless absolutely necessary.In another recent judgement by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in 2019, the court relied upon the Penat principles of Nabha Power Limited v. Punjab State Corporation supra, to interpret the contract harmoniously. It was held that the implied principle of business efficacy can be applied only if the literal terms of the contract cannot be interpreted in a manner leading to fulfillment of intention of both the parties. If the original contracted terms made commercial sense without the application of business efficacy clause, then the courts are bound to go by the literal interpretation. Moreover, the unexpressed term should be implied by the courts only if it forms a part of the intention of the parties at the time of drawing of the contract or if it goes without saying or if it is necessary to provide business efficacy to the contract.CONCLUSIONThe theory of relational contract, unlike in England (Yam Seng, 2013 supra), has yet to undergo direct judicial interpretation and pronouncement. Though, through the principles of good faith and trust laid out in the above-mentioned cases, the Indian courts are moving ahead on the evolution of this contractual structure. These contracts, after the judicial intervention, may be termed as relational contracts. The slow progress of the legal institutions in this sphere is primarily due to the existing dichotomy between express and implied terms and the interpretation of the same by the courts.I believe that the time has come to embrace the developing new structures in the law of contracts. Nowadays, with acute technical dynamics playing a major role in almost every commercial contract, it is impossible to envisage all distinct future possibilities or contentions arising between the parties. It is necessary to validate and introduce relational contracts to regulate and promote duty of good faith, transparency, trust and business efficacy. Formal relational contracts will never truly replace or modify traditional contracts but are necessary to govern the highly complex relations, demanding flexibility and cooperation.REFERENCESChrystal.K & Lipsey.R (1997), “Economics for business and management”, Oxford University Press, New York, Pg.702Lexis Nexis, Infrastructure Arbitration: A Perspective, Manoj K Singh, 1st Edition 2020The Murdock, [1889] 14 PD 64Yam Seng Ptd Ltd v International Trade Corporation Limited, 2013, EWHC 111 (QB)Alan Bates and Others v Post Office Limited, 2019, EWHC 606 (QB)Union of India vs. M/s.

    "data": "This article is written by Anjaly Ann Joseph from Government Law College, Ernakulam. The technocratic constitutional institution of election commission is a priceless gift from our constitution makers, their commitment to democracy and sagacious vision for the smooth running of democratic process is embodied in the creation of an independent election commission. With the evolution of the country, the election commission rose into the position of a powerful super structure and over years it has been able to attain great reputation among the general public .There are various constitutional and statutory provisions relating to election commission such as Article 324 which begins as “The superintendence, direction and control of the preparation of the electoral rolls for, and the conduct of, all elections to Parliament and to the Legislature of every State and of elections to the offices of President and Vice President held under this Constitution shall be vested in a Commission”. It further continues by laying down the structure of the commission and appointment of members. Article 329 places a bar to the intervention of courts in election matters, Article 329(b) of the section mandates that courts cannot entertain any matters related to election disputes other than in a manner laid down by appropriate legislature. As with the statutory acts, Representation of People’s Act 1951 deals with issues such as delimitation of constituencies as well as processual details and the basis of electoral system and the Chief Election Commissioner and other Election Commissioners (Conditions of Service) Act 1991 established a three member election commission.Along with these provisions, several other provisions related to election of the president touches upon the working of the election commission. All the possible power of the commission was explored and liberally applied after 1990. It was the cavalier approach of the then Chief election commissioner T.N Sheshan that fortified the commission. His bold initiatives include stringent enforcement of model code of conduct, introduction of voter id cards, ceilings on election expenditure. He applied the above mentioned power in the constitution to defer election at several times along with instances of him cancelling elections at the last minutes. He even dared to cancel poll campaigns by leaders.But now the tide has turned. Internal dissent within the commission became public a short while ago. Moreover it had a tough time taming the political leaders and enforcing code of conduct. And there exist allegation that EC has become handmaiden of the ruling party. It is doubtless that the erstwhile faith in the commission among the general public have tarnished.Recently the commission became the subject of blatant criticism by conducting elections amid the COVID surge. The election proceeding that extended over two month were conducted on the poll bound states of West Bengal, Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Assam and Puducherry. All the COVID protocols were ignored and the mega rallies of the political parties turned out be super spreader rallies of the mutant virus. Apparently soon after the polls there a huge rise in the COVID cases and death rates have turned alarming. But the election commission, who is independently in charge of overseeing the election stood as a mute spectator all throughout.Lately courts have taken up the issue and pronounced EC entirely responsible for the deadly spread on the second wave. It was the Calcutta High Court that came first came forefront expressing dissatisfaction with EC on the wide scale breach of COVID norms in the West Bengal election. And the High Court pulled up EC for not using its powers. As a result EC banned roadshow and rallies. However, these it is evident that these restrictions had little effect on ground.Then came the notorious remark of Madras High Court calling EC officials murderers. High Court named EC singularly culpable for the deaths to the extent that it even threatened the of stopping the counting of votes . Consequently increased restrictions were affected by the election commission on the counting day. Moreover EC was extremely offended by the remark of Madras HC, moved to Supreme Court of India against it. The Supreme Court agreed that the remarks were derogatory but refused to expunge them and refused to restrain media from reporting the oral remarks.It is worthwhile to note that on the other side of all these drama, we have the common man, whose very life and livelihood is affected by COVID. They are mercilessly prosecuted for flouting a single safety norm. Official statics have come out with massive spike in four states and one Union Territory after Elections. Already Kerala and Tamil Nadu is under lockdown and the state of Assam is under night curfew. The lockdown will have grave effect on the livelihood of people ,who are already stooped in misery. And it is no sin to think today, that even though democracy is for the people, the democratic processes insensitive to the lives of people is a mere sham.As a final code, it is to be said that there is a ‘collective culpability’ in the government and its institutions for apathy to its citizens against putting all blame on EC. The same courts turned a blind eye to the negligence of the political spectrum and to the plight of common man. Court was ready to spill the beans only at the last hour. Evidently there are stark instances of apathy of the judiciary from the beginning of these testing times. Reverting back to the issue here, the part of political parties cannot be condoned. Even media, especially local media in poll states, directed their entire attention to the political vendetta and failed to inform the citizen on the doom about to fall on them. There is a saying that “apathy is the acceptance of unacceptable”. In this instance several segments joined hands to make the unacceptable possible. So, there is a collective responsibility for the indifference shown by all quarters. Curated by Shivanshika Samaddar of National Law University, Delhi. "

    "headline": "CYBER LAWS IN INDIA: EFFECTIVENESSCLAT RESULTS 2019Does PM Care Fund come under RTI Act, 2005?IS THE GOVERNMENT SERIOUS ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF MANUAL SCAVENGERS?",
    "data": " This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida. INTRODUCTIONThe word Cyber has its root in the Greek word kybernetes and its first usage can be traced back to cybernetes, as phrased by Norbert Wiener. The advent of computer technology has brought about a revolutionary change in the progress of human society. With computers came the internet or the world wide web which gives rise to the concept of Cyberspace, where personal as well as community boundaries are not specifically distinguished. Deception and disguise go hand in hand with the internet which gives birth to the need for a legal framework in place to regulate cyberspace. Most of these netizens employ the computer and internet with malicious intent, either for own personal benefit or under influence.The development of Electronic Commerce has impelled the requirement for energetic and compelling administrative instruments which would additionally reinforce the legal institution, essential to the further growth of Electronic Commerce. Every one of these administrative components and legal frameworks come under the ambit of Cyber law.CYBER CRIME‘Cyber crime’ as a term was first proposed by Sussman and Heuston in 1995 amid a mix of information technology related crime tags. Cybercrime is best thought of as a set of acts or conducts rather than a single action. These are illegal acts in which a digital information system is used as a tool or a combination of the two. Electronic crimes, computer-related crimes, e-crime, high-technology crime, information age crime, and other terms are used to describe cybercrime.In simple terms, Cyber Crime refers to offenses or crimes committed using electronic communications or information systems. These are basically illegal activities that involve a computer and a network. An unusual feature relating to cyber crimes is that the victim and the offender may never undergo direct contact. To reduce the chances of detection and prosecution, cybercriminals frequently operate from countries with no or weak cybercrime laws.TYPES OF CYBER CRIME1. Cyber Crime Against Individuals- Crimes committed against an individual or a person by a cyber criminal.Email SpoofingSpammingCyber DefamationInternet Relay Chat (IRC) CrimePhishing2. Cyber Crime Against Property- These include crimes such as computer vandalism, IP crimes, online threatening etc.Software PrivacyCopyright InfringementTrademark Infringement3. Cyber Crime Against Organisations- A few examples include unauthorised changing/deleting of data, unauthorised reading/copying of confidential data.DOS attackEmail bombingSalami attack4. Cyber Crime Against Society- These crimes circumvent the security of the society as a whole.ForgeryWeb jackingAnother useful categorisation is carried out under two main headers-Where the computer is used as a weapon- Such as in the cases of Internet Phishing, Spoofing, Farming, Wire Transfer.Where the computer is a mark of attack- Such as in the cases of Hacking, Virus Attacks, DOS Attacks.HISTORICAL EVOLUTION OF CYBER CRIMEFrom Morris Worm to ransomware, cybercrime has progressed. Many countries, including India, are attempting to prevent these crimes or attacks, but these attacks continue to affect our nation and pose a threat to its security. The eventful history of cyber crimes can be segregated into 3 phases:PHASE I – 1870s to early 1980sThe first cases of surface hacking can be dated back to the 1870s, when telephone phreaking was used to deceive people (hacking long-distance telephone networks illegally so as to make free calls). Because the internet began in the United States, it was here that the first computer-assisted crime occurred in 1969. The end of 1970 saw the evolution of cyber pornography. In a seminar conducted by author Len Adleman in 1983, the first known computer “virus” was designed and tested. It was Germany which first enacted a regulatory law to govern cyberspace technology.PHASE II – Late 1980s to 1990sThis period saw the first instance of cyber theft in the infamous case of R v. Thompson where confidential information of US Govt. and NASA was hacked by cyber criminals. Other significant landmark cases of cyber crimes include R. v. Gold and United States of America v. Jake Baker and Arthur Gonda.In the case of Yahoo, Inc v. Akash Arora, India had its first brush with cyber crime in 1999. Yahoo filed a lawsuit seeking permanent injunction to prevent the defendants and their partners from using the domain name ‘Yahooindia.com’ for commercial purposes. The court clearly stated that other businesses cannot use the Yahoo! Trademark.PHASE III – Since 2000The Indian Parliament ultimately enacted a law to tackle cybercrime in the year 2000. The Information Technology Act (ITA) of 2000 was passed with the sole purpose of establishing a legal framework for business transactions conducted via the internet. The Indian Court, in Rediff Communications Ltd. V. Cyberbooth, took note of the large number of instances involving trademark infringements and reaffirmed the Yahoo! decision. Before tackling cybercrime, it was realized that a slew of concerns needed to be addressed. Post 2004, ‘carding’ swept across the cyber crime sector, which involved international credit card frauds. Other notable recent cyber attacks include the Union Bank of India heist (2016), Wannacry Ransomware(2017), Zynga(2019) etc.CYBER SECURITY LAW IN INDIAThe Information Technology Act, 2000 (“IT Act”), which went into effect on October 17, 2000, contains laws relating to cyber legislation in India. The Act’s principal goal is to give internet trade legal legitimacy and make it easier to file electronic records with the Govt. With the advancement of technology and the emergence of new means of committing crime using the Internet and computers, the need to revise the IT Act, 2000 arose to include new types of cyber offenses and to close other gaps that hampered the efficient implementation of the IT Act, 2000. As a result, the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008 was passed and went into force on October 27, 2009. On various counts, the IT (Amendment) Act of 2008 has brought forth significant revisions to the IT Act of 2000.INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ACT, 2000The Information Technology Act of 2000 governs the use of computers, computer systems and networks, as well as data and information in electronic form. This legislation covers a wide range of topics, including electronic authentication, digital/electronic signatures, cybercrime, and network service provider liability.EFFECTIVENESSCyber laws are questionable in their efficacy. Despite the fact that the parliament attempted to provide a solid legal framework to govern and define the bar for user information that can be evaded in cyberspace, in truth, the Parliament’s efforts are praiseworthy, as it has revised a large number of laws to conform to the IT Act’s objectives. The IT Act, 2000 defaults in catering to the remedies for emerging cyber threats. Apart from lack of variety in laws, there has been weak implementation of the existing laws by the governing body. The laws need to be tailored in a technology neutral manner with their scope expanding over at least all known cyber issues and those stemming from them. Even the cases which do get registered witness a low conviction rate, hampering the effectiveness of cyber security laws in India.The quantum of punishment offered under this act seems to be soft on the criminals. This needs to be revised or else the very purpose of this act will stand defeated. The narrow cyberspace issue spectrum of the IT Act facilitates unprecedented growth in the cyber threats every day. A number of issues which plague the internet today have not been provided enough coverage under the act. The IT Act has a long road left to travel and needs to undergo extensive amendments to incorporate within itself the capacity to secure India’s cyberspace.CONCLUSIONAs our reliance on technology grows, cyber laws in India and around the world must be updated and reviewed on a regular basis. The pandemic has also driven a large portion of the workforce into a remote working mode, highlighting the importance of app security. The world of this generation is digital and thus, more needs to be done to protect them from the traps and snares of this mind-boggling technological maze. Legislators must go above and beyond to stay ahead of the impostors in order to stop them in their tracks. Cybercrime can be managed, but it will take the combined efforts of legislators, Internet providers, intermediaries such as banks and shopping sites, and of course, the users. Only these stakeholders’ sensible actions, assuring their adherence to the law of cyberspace, can ensure online safety and resilience. Cyberspace security can be solidified at homes as well with a little more precaution and involvement from the ends of guardians. The recent incident of Bois Locker Room has been an eye-opener for a lot of us and should be seen as a one time issue stimulating swift action on part of the relevant authorities.While some issues will always persist owing to the open nature of cyberspace, some level of vulnerability will always be present and cannot be entirely eliminated. As a result, ethical use of the internet is expected and encouraged.REFERENCESCybernetics: Control & Communication in Animal & The Machine, Reissue of 1961 IInd Edition, Norbert Wiener, MIT Press, CambridgeOxford Handbook of Crime & Public Policy, Michael Tonry, Oxford University Press, 2009J L.

    "data": " This article is written by Girija Rani MullapudiWhat makes one an e-commerce consumer? Any activity which has one ordering a product or service online, regardless of its payment method can make them an e-commerce consumer. It ranges from purchasing a product from a website, app, television shopping program, to even an unregistered company, such as a Facebook page selling earrings. Any and every product can be sold and bought on the internet, starting from phones and books, utilities and even digital goods such as applications and consumption licenses; and they all can be considered to be the part of e-commerce.A market-based or inventory-based approach may be used by the e-commerce business from which you purchase. The former has goods or services manufactured by the same corporation and sold online, such as the furniture company PepperFry’s online shopping service or the airline company Indigo’s ticket booking site. In the market-based paradigm, the e-commerce business acts as a platform for various businesses’ goods and services. The website serves only as a conduit for the trade. Examples include Flipkart and MakeMyTrip.Consumer Protection Act, 1986The Consumer Protection Law 2019, which went into effect on July 20, 2020, contains specific guidelines for e-commerce businesses and online retailers. The government has asked e-commerce companies to ensure that their grievance officers accept every consumer complaint within 48 hours and resolve it within one month in order to prevent consumers from being duped on e-commerce platforms.The Ministry of Consumer Affairs, Food, and Public Distribution has issued a new set of consumer protection e-commerce regulations, which prohibits e-commerce companies from enforcing cancellation fees on customers who return goods or services they have ordered unless the company bears equivalent fees. The government also stated that showing the country of origin would be needed so that consumers can make an informed decision at the pre-purchase stage.IT Amendment Act, 2008E-commerce aids in paving the way for digital transactions, resulting in writing and signatures no longer being used as legal evidence. In such a case, regulatory changes in e-commerce are needed. This act has a significant impact on the legal infrastructure as well as the laws and regulations that govern how the E-Commerce sector operates, and this act was required in order to protect customers’ privacy and security issues. This law governs the processing, handling, and dissemination of personal information collected by visitors to an e-commerce website.The following three legal agreements must be used by any online ecommerce business:Policy on Returns, Cancellations, and Refunds: This agreement is used to remind a buyer of the return and termination policies of an ecommerce website. The first section of this essay discussed the need for and application of such a policy.Terms & Conditions: This is a voluntary partnership that sets out standards and regulations for consumer registration, use, and access to an ecommerce website. A terms of service arrangement binds the parties that commit to it lawfully. The essay ‘Why does a website need a disclaimer?’ goes into more detail on this.Personal Information Protection Policy: A privacy policy tells a client of a company’s privacy practices, the types of information gathered, and the purpose and application of that data. Under the Information and Technology Amendment Act of 2008 and the Information Technology Rules of 2011, this arrangement is a legal requirement.What If the Online Store Refuses to Issue a Refund?If you pay for your online order with a credit card and the redemption period has not yet expired, you can contact your credit card issuer to refund your money on your behalf. This is referred to as chargeback.You can send letters instead of contacting goods suppliers because a written letter is considered more credible and can be used to bring a lawsuit against the retailer in a customer court.If your complaints are not settled, you have one more option: go to the consumer forum or the consumer court and file a complaint against the retailer.Determine if the E-Commerce firm or the retailer is at fault, and then take corrective steps. In the event of a defective product, the retailer is ultimately responsible for refunding your money.According to the Information Technology Act, every e-commerce organization must have a grievance officer, whose contact information should be posted on the company website. Bring your complaint to this officer’s attention., on the other hand, claims that many businesses are ignorant of the requirement for a complaints officer.Any e-commerce firms have an arbitration clause in place that will assist in resolving the issue.If none of these solutions work, get the dealer’s and manufacturer’s/service provider’s names and addresses. Complain to each of them in writing, plainly outlining the essence of the issue, evidence of purchase, and the relief you need. Insist on a written response from them, and set a deadline for them to respond.Send the letter via registered mail so that you can get confirmation of receipt. You can file a complaint with any of these entities that the product defect could have happened at some point in the supply chain, and one of them could be to blame.If you haven’t had a response by the deadline, contact the consumer forum or board. If necessary, get assistance from a local consumer organization. E-commerce customers will file lawsuits at their local consumer forum, according to a Supreme Court order from August 2017. While the Consumer Protection Act forbids it, the SC had issued the order for the convenience of online shoppers. “In certain cases, e-commerce firms that serve as intermediaries attempt to shift the blame to the manufacturer by claiming that the invoice is ultimately directed to them. However, some clauses, such as those found in the IT Act, mandate e-commerce firms to practice due diligence.”In certain cases, e-commerce intermediaries tend to shift the blame to the manufacturer by claiming that the invoice is ultimately made to them. However, some rules, such as those found in the IT Act, mandate e-commerce businesses to practice due diligence.REFERENCESDoes your website need a disclaimer?

    "headline": "IS YOUR PRIVATE VEHICLE A PUBLIC PLACE? -LAW HAS DIFFERENT ANSWERSThe Indian Legal Legend: Fali S NarimanSix Women Lawyers designated as Senior Advocate by the Supreme CourtONLINE LEARNING AND VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 21-A OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTION",
    "data": "This article is written by Robin Kumar Thakur from Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Law is more than just the ‘plain meaning’ of the words of a statute. The application of law also takes into account the intended meaning of the words in the statute, the context, and the seriousness of the crisis or situation. This leads to a whole range of different answers to various questions related to the applicability or interpretation of the law. The various precedents set by the courts over time shows us that one can find different or even conflicting answers in law to the same questions.Personal Vehicle As A Public PlaceThe supreme court in the case of Boota Singh vs The State of Haryana held that a private vehicle will not be considered as public property, under Section 43 of the NDPS act. The accused here was charged with the possession of drugs, which were recovered from a jeep at a public place by the high court.The petitioner here appealed against the decision of the high court contending that the vehicle from which the drugs were confiscated was a private vehicle so it should be governed by Section 42 of the NDPS Act, which deals with search, seizures and arrest without warrant and not with Section 43 which deals with seizure and arrest at a public place. The plaintiff contended that since Section 42 was not at all compiled, they were entitled to be acquitted. Section 43 (b) of the NDPS act explains public place as any public conveyance, hotel, shop, or other place intended for use by, or accessible to, the public.Here, the supreme court noted that since this explanation of the public place only referred to “public conveyance” and not “personal vehicle”, the accused was acquitted on the grounds that a personal vehincle was not a publice place and it was the duty of the officers to abide by the procedures of Sec 42 of the NDPS act, which they failed to do.Personal Vehicle, A Public Place: Delhi Face Masking RuleRecently the Delhi high court in Saurabh Sharma and others vs Delhi Sub-divisional Magistrate (East) and others mandated the use of masks even if the person is travelling alone in his personal vehicle. The judgement was delivered by Justice Pratibha M Singh, stating that, in the present scenario of the Covid- 19 pandemic, any personal vehicle will be regarded as a public place. The court also said that the meaning of the word ‘public’ differs from statute to statute and context to context while referring to the precedents established in the case of Gaurav Jain vs Union of India.The court, citing the COVID-19 pandemic stated that there is a risk of transmission to another person who might enter the car later. The court also stated that there exists a plethora of possibilities in which a person driving alone in their car is exposed to the outside environment.Citing the immediate risk of exposure, the court held that a personal vehicle travelling across the city, even if occupied by one man only will be considered as a public place. While there was much doubt regarding the reasoning behind wearing masks in one’s personal car, it is to be noted that the court did not want to interfere in the regulations passed by the concerned authorities in Epidemic Diseases Act and Disaster Management Act. The court, citing the grave situation due to the Covid-19 pandemic, was being extra cautious. The chance of reducing the risk of transmission amid this grave situation of the COVID-19 pandemic seems to be the reason behind this judgement.Alcohol Consumption In A Personal CarThe Supreme Court in the case Satvinder Singh Saluja vs The State Of Bihar had held that a person consuming liquor in a personal vehicle, at a public place will be held liable under the Bihar Excise Act which prohibits alcohol in the state of Bihar.In this case, the petitioners while travelling from Giridih, Jharkhand to Patna, Bihar in a private vehicle were stopped at a checkpoint, where they were subjected to a breath analyser test. A certain amount of alcohol was found in the test. The petitioners argued that their personal vehicle cannot be said to be a public place under section 2 (17A) of the Bihar Excise (Amendment) Act 2016 and therefore the ingredient of section 53 (A) is not satisfied.The court ruled out the first argument on the basis of the definition of ‘public place’ given in the section 2 (17A) of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise (amendment) act 2016 which defines public place as any place to which public has access whether as a matter of right or not and includes all places visited by public and also includes any open space or any transport, whether public or private ; the court also added that though it may be true that the public has no right to access the car but it definitely has the opportunity to access the car on public roads. Hence the car comes under the ambit of Section 2(17A) of Bihar Excise Amendment Act 2016.The court also emphasised on the fact that Section 2(53) of the Bihar Prohibition and Excise Act 2016 specifically included means of transport, both public and private.CONCLUSIONAt the first stroke from the above judgments gives us the feeling that whether a car is a private or public place depends upon the fact that whether the occupant is wearing a mask or lighting a joint. Law is not exact science, it behaves differently in different circumstances. In this case, the question as to what constitutes a public place cannot be universally set in stone. The term public place differs from statute to statute, enactment and even depends upon the context. Since most statutes have different definitions of the public place, there are different judgements by the courts. This shows us that sometimes answers in law can be contrary to the intuition of the layman.REFERENCESThe NARCOTIC DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES ACT. 1985, Sec 42, Act no. 61, Acts of Parliament, 1985The NARCOTIC DRUGS AND PSYCHOTROPIC SUBSTANCES ACT. 1985, Sec 43, Act no. 61, Acts of Parliament, 1985BIHAR PROHIBITION AND EXCISE ACT, 2016, Bihar Act 20 of 2016Boota Singh & Others v State Of Haryana – LNIND 2021 SC 14 (India)Saurabh Sharma And Others v Sub-divisional Magistrate (East) & Others – LNIND 2021 DEL 708 (India)Satvinder Singh Saluja And Others v The State Of Bihar – LNIND 2019 SC 478 (India)Gaurav Jain v Union of India (1997) 8 SCC 114 (India) Curated by Shivanshika Samaddar of National Law Unvesity Delhi.

    "headline": "IMPORTANCE OF MEDICLAIM POLICYAn Overview on Anti- Hijacking ActCOVID-19, PLANETARY HEALTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE!INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN INDIA",
    "data": "This article has been written by Samridhi Prakash from Symbiosis Law School, Noida(In reference to Advocates)BACKGROUNDThe concept of ‘Mediclaim’ was introduced in India in the year of 1986, offering minimum coverage of Rs. 15,000 and a maximum of Rs. 5 lakhs. For the employees in the government sector, the Central Government Health Insurance Scheme was launched, while for the people employed in the private sector, Employees State Insurance Scheme was introduced to cater to their medical necessities. The idea envisaged was narrow in scope and extent, providing minimal insurance relief-only to individuals and their families. There was capping on every relief offered through these policies. With the opening of the market in the 1990s and introduction of diverse economic reforms, health insurance schemes too, witnessed drastic advancement. Removal of sub-limits, entry of private players in the medical sector, increased life expectancy, reforms in the varieties of policies offered- all these factors helped influence the public, pushing them to try various health insurance schemes. Moreover, in 2001, IRDA (Insurance Regulatory & Development Authority) introduced third party administrators, facilitating the set-up between hospitals and companies by providing cashless provisions on their products. With the advancement of technology and the growth of the IT sector as well as the service sector and the wide spectrum of life-style diseases, chronic diseases, critical illnesses etc. plaguing our generation, the need for health insurances and life insurances have taken the market by frenzy.IMPORTANCE/ NEED FOR MEDICLAIM POLICYBearing the current pandemic in mind, as well as the illnesses afflicting our society due to the life-style we pursue, the importance of health insurance cover can be recognised and realised. As families are grappling with the fear and havoc caused by Coronavirus, the inflated costs of hospitalisation, oxygen cylinders, PPE kits, oximeters, masks etc., are burning holes in our collective pockets. Mediclaim policies provide security, protection and confidence in these tough trying times. They ease the financial strain by eliminating expenses which might be out-of-pocket for families who are currently grappling with the clutches of the virus.MEDICLAIM POLICIES AND LAWYERSIt was highlighted by the Madras High Court very recently in re Sudha Ramalingam v. The Bar Council & Ors., W.P. No. 13047 of 2020, Madras High Court (2021) that there are roughly 65,000 advocates on the rolls of the Bar Council of Tamil Nadu and Puducherry and none of them are provided any health cover benefits by the said authority. The appalling state of affairs beckon the State and the legal administration to introspect upon their handling of the current crisis and provide respite to their lawyers. The hon’ble court directed the council to set-up a 9-member committee to review the introduction of a group health insurance whose benefits might also be extended to the families of concerned lawyers. In 2019, the Central Government had set up a 5-member committee to frame a health policy supporting a structured framework and also to deliberate upon the modalities of its execution. The scheme was formulated to provide a comprehensive welfare mechanism for all the advocates across India.Yet, the grim reality suggests otherwise about the intentions of the authorities regarding the implementation of this scheme. Delhi Government in collaboration with the Bar Council of Delhi had, in December 2019, contrived a medical insurance scheme for all the advocates residing in Delhi and enrolled with the Bar Council by The New India Assurance Company Limited (NIAC). The scheme was allocated Rs. 40.60 crore out of the Rs. 50 crore budget of the Chief Minister Advocates Welfare Scheme as announced by the Law Minister Kailash Gehlot. Under this scheme, Rs. 5 lakhs have been columnised under medical insurance and Rs. 10 lakhs for term insurance individually. The registration under the scheme started in March 2020 but owing to the Covid-19 pandemic the process got inadvertently delayed. A petition regarding the same was filed before the Delhi High Court urging the court to pass immediate orders as the undue delay of the said welfare scheme was responsible for bereaving the legal fraternity of its benefits, that too in the present unprecedented circumstances.The abysmal delay in the implementation of this scheme rendered many advocates helpless in the times of need and it was only on 10th December, 2020 that the registration was opened by the Delhi Government. Under this welfare scheme, the immediate family members as well as dependent parents are also provided an inclusive cover. According to the data provided by the Bar Association, out of the 37,135 lawyers registered as voters in Delhi 29.098 are on the rolls of the council to avail health benefits under the said welfare scheme. Another commendable health security step has been taken by the Delhi Bar Council by providing a much-needed breather to advocates registered under its tutelage. It has offered financial assistance of Rs. 25,000 (home quarantine) and Rs. 50,000 (hospitalisation and not covered under any scheme) to the advocates afflicted with the virus.CONCLUSIONIn these trying times of extraordinary physical as well as mental anguish the authorities in power should not hold back in assisting their workers. Spotlighting the way ahead, this pandemic has flagged the loopholes in the administration of medical and health infrastructure and services. With the most recent numbers shared by the World Health Organisation (WHO), the current death due to Covid data stands at 31,64,577 globally as on 29th April, 2021. The staggering variety as well as figure of cases is a matter of grave concern for a country as diversely/deeply populated as India with limited medical infrastructure and services which themselves are wrapped in bureaucratic red tape. The legal community, despite the existence of welfare funds, has been deprived of the benefits it may legally derive from the said funds. Streamlining of welfare health benefit schemes is the urgent need in order to bring the legal family under a single umbrella of Mediclaim cover. The central government in association with the BCI and the State Bar Councils should revamp its health policy terms and provide the much-needed respite sought by the advocates for themselves and their families.REFERENCESAkshita Saxena, Madras High Court Constitutes Committee To Make Recommendations On Insurance Cover For 65,000 Lawyers, LiveLaw (April 26, 2021) https://www.livelaw.in/news-updates/madras-high-court-insurance-cover-for-lawyers-173129?infinitescroll=1N.

    "headline": "The 50% Reservation Ceiling: Protection or obstructive Equality“WORK FROM HOME: A NEW NORMAL AND A COMPLETE PARADIGM SHIFT TO A NEW CULTURE”.ONLINE LEARNING AND VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 21-A OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTIONMARRIAGES DURING COVID",
    "data": "This article is written by- Surbhi Kumari from Amity University, Patna.AbstractThe issue of reservation has continuously been contentious in reference to the idea of equality enshrined within the Constitution. The present reservation policy hasn’t solved several problems like non-applicability of the creamy layer within the case of SCs and STs, casteism, reservation within the promotion within the case of employment, wealthiest persons inside SCs, STs and OBCs, and to incorporate additional castes in backward categories underneath political pressure. This text intends to analyse the provisions of the Constitution of India vis-à-vis reservation policy; the 103rd change affects the equality principle, breaches most of the limit for reservation and violates basic structure belief. To analyse the judicial pronouncements and implementation of the judicial pronouncements of reservation policy through Government Policies and to recommend the modifications within the reservation policy and thereby making certain equality.Keywords: Reservation Policy, Constitutional Provisions, Judicial Pronouncements.IntroductionIndian Society has been delineated as a “compartmental” society. Underneath it is a massive range of teams maintaining distinct and numerous types of life. Sovereign Asian country determinedly and unambiguously embarked on the countervailing discrimination principle with a powerful justification that it works as an efficient mechanism to offset the historical additive deprivation toughened by lower castes. The reality is that Indian social structure has, for hundreds of years, committed social and economic injustices by the so–called higher castes on the lower castes who are denied equality within the chance and therefore the facilities of the society. The framers of the Indian Constitution incorporated into the Constitution provisions for countervailing discrimination programmes. The policy of initiatives employed in India to offset the inequalities of society could be a policy of reservations. Within the annals of Asian country history, it’s evident that some categories of individuals measured backward because of historical injustice and exploitation. Therefore, the notion of ‘reservation’ has been enshrined within the Constitution of Asian country specifically in Article 15 (4) &16 (4).Meaning of “Reservation”Reservation by definition entails some preference for the deprived UN agencies could otherwise lose in Associate in Nursing open competition with people who square measure lucky to possess an honest education, coaching and upbringing. It’s intercalary within the Indian Constitution as a positive way to produce a chance to the Backward categories to boost quality within the service. However, whereas providing advantages of the policy of the “reservation”, a stable equilibrium is required to stay between justice towards the Backward categories, equity for the forwards likewise as potency for the whole system. The idea of the “reservation” is incredibly wide. As a generic idea, the reservation is Associate in Nursing anti–poverty live. According alternative read, reservation is simply providing a right of access however it’s not a right to redress.HistoryIndia was a country with a very rigid caste. The conventional Indian society had witnessed the luxuriant growth of stratified movement embodied inside the institutions of grouping and caste. The legal origin of Reservation Policy in India began with lying down of the govt. of India Act, 1919 that came throughout war I. Once itinerant the whole Indian provinces, their representatives planned for combining separate electorates and reserving seats for depressed classes and demand for the broader franchise. The Poona written agreement of 1932 came into force whereby the Prime Minister Macdonald declared the communal award where separate representations were to be provided to Muslims, Sikhs, Christians, Indians and Dalits’ were appointed seats.Case lawIn the case of State of Madras v. Champakam Dorairajan , the Court struck down the order of the Madras Government that had fastened the proportion of scholars of every community of the backward categories which will be admitted into the medical and engineering schools go by the authorities, and therefore the Court command that the reservation of seats for the backward categories within the skilled colleges is offensive of the equality principle enshrined in Article fourteen. This judgment resulted in insertion of clause (4) to Article 15.50% RuleThe Supreme Court in Indra Sawhney vs.UOI capped the limit of the reservation to 5 hundredth. With regard to the 5 hundredth rule, it was completely commanded by the Supreme Court that Article 16(4) is Associate in Nursing exception to equality of probability one thing on prime of 5 hundredth would imply the advantage of limitation. In 2006, a difficulty was raised before the Supreme Court that whether or not the 5 hundredth rule could also be a neighbourhood of the essential structure or not. Throughout this case, the court noted that “the ceiling limit of fifty, the construct of creamy layer, sub normality and inadequacy of illustration unit of measurement all constitutional wants whereas not that the structure of equality would collapse”.ConclusionThe idea of providing the reservation to the socially and educationally backward classes inside the Constitution was for some ten years but at the will of ruling organisation inside the system, but this era kept it extending and it made people to promote for the interests of backward classes with the foremost aim of getting votes and to be in power.Curated by Athira Albert of Kristu Jayanti College of Law, Bangalore.

The Supreme Court’s constitutional bench reopened the debate on sub-categorization of SCs and STs for reservation in September 2020 and when debate arose, only few communities have secured a part of 27% reservation among over 2,600 that were included in the Central List of OBCs.Need for sub-categorizationFor reservation, there were arguments for sub-categorization and creating categories within OBCs. It should ensure equitable distribution among all OBCs. Rohini Commission was held on 2nd October, 2017 for examination and they were given 12 weeks to submit its report but has been given many extensions since, the latest one being the 10th. The Centre had granted constitutional status to NCBC (National Commission for Backward Classes) before the Rohini Commission was set up.What are the Commissions’ terms of reference?Examining the inequitable distribution among the castes and communities which includes in broad category of OBCs of benefit of reservation to such classes including in Central List.Norms, mechanism, criteria and parameters in a scientific approach for sub-categorization within OBCs to workout.Identifying the castes, sub-castes, communities in the Central List of OBCs and classifying into their respective sub-categories.These are the main three terms of reference, mentioned above and the fourth term of reference was included on 22nd January, 2020 when Cabinet granted it an extension.Correction of ambiguities, inconsistencies, repetitions, errors of spelling and transcription in the central list of OBCs entries.Why are so many extensions being given?On 30th July, 2019 Commission sent the letter to the government and also noted several ambiguities from the sub-categorized central list of OBCs. Before preparing the central list of sub-categorized, the Commission’s opinion is to be clarified or rectified.What progress has it made so far? The Commission wrote a letter to the Government on 30th July, 2019 that it is ready with the draft report on sub-categorization.Following the latest term of reference was given on 22nd January, 2020 to the Commission. In the Central List, it is studying the list of communities.How smooth has its work been?Various communities are comparing their representation in admissions and jobs. The Home Minister announced that in Census 2021, OBCs data will be collected but the government has been silent on this matter and it was on 31st August, 2018. Several groups of OBCs are demanding for enumeration of OBCs in the Census.What have the findings been so far?1.3 lakh central jobs given under OBC quota over the preceding five years, the Commission analyzed in 2018 and OBC admissions to central higher education institutions.25% of all sub-castes classified as OBCs as 97% of all education and jobs seats have gone; 24.95% of these seats have gone to just 10 OBC communities.Group-A Central government 16.51%Group-B Central government 13.38%Group-C Excluding safai karamcharis 21.25%Group-C Safai karamcharis 17.72%Zero representation in education and jobs out of total 37% and 2.68% in admissions and recruitment out of 994 OBC sub-castes have a total representation. The Commission’s tenure has been extended by the Centre to examine sub-categorization of OBCs (Other Backward Classes) headed by Justice G Rohini till 31st July, 2021 (this year). Due to nationwide lockdown and even restrictions on travel imposed on account of the pandemic, the commission was not performing the task assigned to them. Broadcasting Minister Prakash Javadekar and Union Information said that Narendra Modi (Prime Minister) had decided to give an extension. He said that this was due to circumstances which were affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, otherwise the work of the commission was ongoing.Rs 1.92 crore have been spent on the Commission including salary, consultant fee and other expenses and the report is yet to be publicized. It is understood that the report will have huge political consequences.If sub-categorization follows some conditions, then it will lead to beneficial results, if its fulfilled:Make OBC quota proportional to their population and enumerate the OBCs.Reservations of OBCs are fully implemented at all levels and censure the institutions not doing so.In the public sector, increased the jobs of people.Make sure, SC/ST/OBCs get the number of seats they are entitled to and plug all the loopholes in it.The Communities which exist in the OBC list, have not been to get any major benefit of the scheme of OBC for reservation and for appointment in Central Government. Educations are expected to benefitted upon implementation of the recommendations of the Commission. Such recommendations are for the benefit of marginalized communities in the list of OBCs.Expenditure involved related to the administration and establishment costs of the Commission. It would continue to be borne by the Department of Social Justice and Empowerment.Persons who belong to the castes and communities are included in the Central List of SEBCs but have not been getting any major benefit of the existing scheme of reservation for OBCs in Central Government posts & admission in Central Educations would be benefitted.ConclusionSub-categorization of the OBCs need not imply establishing a further social hierarchy within the communities included in the Central List on the basis of relative lowness or otherwise of their ascribed social status or traditional occupation. It is not hard to draw the conclusion that the OBC is treated as some sort of a compromised category. After all, the artisanal and service caste, who are supposed to be the main beneficiary of the sub-categorisation, deserve much more than a bureaucratic pipe dream.

    "data": " This article is written by Girija Rani Mullapudi from Damodaram Sanjivayya National Law University (DSNLU).“Vaccines Don’t Save Lives – Vaccination Save Lives”INTRODUCTIONCreating an effective vaccine is half the journey, the main objective is to getting it to people’s arms to facilitate actual real protection; a process that has its own different set of obstacles like logistical, supply, distribution, and ethical challenges. This is the largest mass vaccination campaign and most rapid one in to be ever witnessed and also comes with manufacturing complexities, a probable lack of facilities and ways to ship and store these vaccines, not to forget the complications with the second dosage. The question then arises of who should get vaccinated first; and doing this equitably is critically important because we know there is structural imbalance as to the impact of the pandemic on different people.WHAT DOES VACCINE EQUITY MEAN?The equitable distribution of vaccines worldwide is essential to ending infectious diseases that spread rapidly between countries. The fair and equitable access to vaccines has emerged as a major issue. Government bodies in various countries, the WHO and various other organisations are working on this problem, and are developing guidelines and ethical norms.WHO issued a call in January 2021 to all countries to work together in unity – and in each other’s best interests – to ensure that vaccination of health workers and older people was underway in all countries within the first 100 days of the year. This call to action is at the core of WHO’s #VaccinEquity movement, which seeks to end the pandemic and the disparities that are at the root of numerous public health issues while also driving a global recovery.The #VaccinEquity Declaration has been signed by tens of thousands of people and nearly 1500 organisations from all over the world by day 100. About half a billion doses of COVID-19 vaccine have been distributed globally, with over 38 million COVAX doses delivered to over 100 countries and economies.The COVID-19 Vaccine Equity Project (CVEP) seeks to address these more localised issues in low and middle-income countries by assisting with vaccine monitoring, supply management, community involvement, and more.The greatest obstacle to ending the pandemic’s acute stage and pushing a global recovery remains to be a shortage of vaccine supplies and inequitable delivery of vaccines. Trade and tourism will be affected as long as the outbreak is spread around the world, delaying economic growth. Continued delivery means more variations that could evade vaccination, as well as a greater burden on the health services and personnel that support us.Why is vaccine equity so important?World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has warned that the mentality of vaccine nationalism, where countries push to get first access puts the world on the brink of “catastrophic moral failure.”CHALLENGESThe Access to COVID-19 Tools (ACT) Accelerator, which seeks to ensure equal access to tests, therapies, and vaccines around the world, is reportedly facing a $27 billion funding deficit. COVID-19 Vaccine Global Access Facility, or COVAX, is the vaccinations pillar, which seeks to deliver vaccines and other services to low and middle-income nations.“The more this disparity persists, the more difficult it becomes to comprehend why, provided that this represents a tiny fraction of the trillions of dollars mobilised for stimulus packages in G20 countries,” WHO Director-General Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in a press conference.Vaccine colonialism occurs as nations rely on using their power and money to vaccinate their own population before other countries collect vaccinations. President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa recently called on countries to cease hoarding vaccines in this manner.“Vaccine nationalism is a problem for us,” Ramaphosa said. “The world’s wealthy nations went out and purchased vast quantities of vaccines from the vaccine’s producers and suppliers. Any nations go far and beyond, acquiring four times their population’s requirements.”As new, more infectious COVID-19 variants spread throughout Africa, health facilities are being overloaded, according to the WHO. The widespread dissemination of extremely infectious strains emphasizes the importance of equitable vaccine delivery. Otherwise, new and more dangerous mutants may occur, rendering current vaccinations useless.“We are all at risk if certain countries vaccinate their citizens and others do not,” Ramaphosa said at the World Economic Forum, pushing for equitable vaccination coverage.INDIA’S VERDICT ON VACCINE EQUITYIn the aftermath of the Centre’s decision to put half of the vaccine stocks on the open market for state governments and private hospitals to purchase, states say vaccine equity – who gets how much, where, and for what price -is emerging as one of the most pressing issues. Some states are concerned that as vaccination is made available to anyone above the age of 18 on May 1, there will be a scarcity problem.CONLUSIONThe World Health Organization (WHO) and allies are leading multilateral initiatives including COVAX and the Access to COVID-19 Resources (ACT) Accelerator to increase access to vaccination – and other required resources and therapies. To speed up the process, the WHO has also asked vaccine manufacturers to license their inventions to other companies. Meanwhile, more funding for the ACT Accelerator is needed to ensure that countries have access to other life-saving experiments and equipment. Finally, long-term framework strengthening based on human rights is needed to ensure that all COVID-related and non-COVID-related diseases receive equal treatment. When it comes to caring for people with “long COVID” and administering potential variant-adjusted vaccines as the pandemic fades, good health services will be critical.It is important for countries to keep in mind that no one is protected until everyone is safe. Join the vaccine justice campaign by taking steps here to ensure that COVID-19 is addressed for all, anywhere.REFERENCES Curated by Shivanshika Samaddar from National Law University DelhiA Funding DeficitVaccination regarding nationalismCOVID-19 Variants are now available.

    "data": " This article is written by Ritika Srivastava of The ICFAI University, Dehradun and Curated by Athira Albert of Kristu Jayanti College of Law, Bangalore. IntroductionIndia is facing a sudden spike in the number of covid-19 cases, another wave of novel corona virus. The country reported over 3 lacs cases per day. It is rising at an alarming rate which is literally not excellent news for any of us. The situation is getting worse day by day, with hospitals unbearly full, oxygen supplies running low, people dying in line waiting to see doctors and therefore the actual toll of death is way above than officially reported. The level of fear reaches the position that the people started wearing PPE kits while stepping outside.The Election Commission also granted permission to hold elections in this horrific and pathetic situation most of the states are directing elections. Such states are West Bengal, Uttar Pradesh, Assam, Tamil Nadu, Puducherry, and Kerala. The parties with full zeal and enthusiasm are conducting rallies with large gatherings of individual, mostly without face masks. In spite of focusing on the crisis where there is a lack of oxygen supplies and beds, the government is busy fighting elections and conducting rallies.Election Commission’s ResponsibilitiesAs a massive rise in the covid-19 cases, the EC issued certain guidelines with the suggestion of various political parties, chief electoral officers of states and UTs on the election campaign. The commission planned regarding the management of preventive measures and these guidelines will be equipped in consultation with the Nodal officers for covid-19 in their respective states/UTs.GuidelinesEvery person involved in election related activity is compelled to wear a face mask.At the entrance of the polling areas there must:Thermal scanning,Sanitizer, soap etc shall be available.Social Distancing.Large hall should be identified for polling.There must be a limited number of vehicles present there for polling personnel, security personnel to ensure compliance of covid-19 guidelines.On 28th April, EC announced certain more guidelines regarding counting. It made it mandatory for the candidate and their agent to show their negative RT-PCR report within 48 hours of start of counting or to show their complete vaccination only after which they would be permitted to enter the centre. Proper sanitization of the hall, added later on. The candidates or their agents, in order to enter the counting hall on 2nd May in Assam, West Bengal, Kerala, Puducherry, and Tamil Nadu must have taken both the doses of vaccine. Moreover, there shall be no public gathering outside the centre, shall have sufficient arrangement of PPE kits and the hall shall be large (proper ventilation) as per available protocol of the State Disaster Management Authority.Election Commission’s Liabilities on the failure of Covid Protocols“You (Election Commission) are the only institution that is responsible for the situation today….No action against political parties taking rallies despite every order of the court” said Justice Sanjib BanerjeeElection Commission fails to stop abuse of Covid-19 Protocol during rallies, polling campaign. The honourable court of Madras in its proceeding called EC an “irresponsible institution” and put the charges of Murder. The writ petition is filed by Tamil Nadu minister M.R. Vijaybhaskar for the sake of public interest to ensure fair counting. The bench in its decision also threatened the EC that if they did not find the proper arrangement of Covid-19 at the venue of counting on 2nd May, then in that situation they would stop the counting of assembly votes.The campaign is involved in rallies with large numbers of people – with least social distancing and wearing of face masks. Political Parties have continued to break the protocol set by EC. Indian commission has warned many times on gatherings but they don’t appear to have been heeded.The Election Commission is singularly accountable for the widespread of the Covid-19, it fails to stop the massive political rallies in the country where all the protocols are violated. The remark of High Court is apt; the EC is liable under murder charges because it cost death of large number of people. The graph of corona rose suddenly in the month of April when the rallies started. No action against the parties has been taken despite court orders. The people are also criticising EC over their decision on conducting political rallies. The importance to hold such protocol might be destroyed by the EC going by the puerile silence on campaign and rallies conducted without proper norms being maintained in the wanton disregard of the other items of the protocol.“Public health is of paramount importance and it is distressing that constitutional authorities have to be reminded in such regard. It is only when citizens survive that they enjoy the other rights that this democratic republic guarantees unto them. The situation is now one of survival and protection and, everything else comes thereafter,” the court said.ConclusionThe Election Commission is directly or indirectly accountable for the widespread, as election during this situation is totally a fallacious decision. Election is for the welfare of the citizen and if they are affected by election, it is of no use. It should be postponed as the parties did not follow any of the guidelines or norms after a number of warnings. The candidate continues to think about themselves and not the society. Not a single party took an initiative for the cancellation of the election, but gathered a large number of people in their rallies without following the Covid norms. Hence, people are dying and the graph of death rate is increasing, but the government is silent, EC is silent but it’s the society who is being affected. "

    "headline": "HOW FAR WILL THE CANCELLATION OF EXAMS AFFECT THE FUTURE OF A STUDENT?Right to Information: Evolution and Recent SetbacksWhat is the impact of online court proceedings with respect to litigants and lawyers?DELHI HC IMPOSES 50K COSTS ON WOMAN FOR FALSE SEXUAL HARASSMENT PLEA",
    "data": "This article is written by Anjaly Ann Joseph of Government Law College, Ernakulam.INTRODUCTIONExam seasons tend to be the most stressful periods of time for every student, owing to the status of examination in our highly competitive society; where the society equates results of examinations with not mere hard work or academic pursuit but the societal status of an entire family and putting the identity of the child at stake. In these already competitive and suffocating times, a pandemic does nothing but add to the woes of students. The second wave of Coronavirus has created a space for ambiguity and anxiousness due to the necessity of cancellation and postponement of exams, leaving the students wondering about their future of their academic pursuits. WHAT IMPORTANCE DO THESE EXAMINATIONS HOLD?Examination, particularly written examination has been the standard form for testing the level of knowledge and proficiency acquired in a particular subject since it was introduced in the colonial times. Even though various other forms of assessment have been incorporated into our education system, the emphasis on written examination has not decreased and is still prioritized over the others.When students grow up in a society which constantly judges their value on the basis of these marks, students often do not question whether their grades, be it board exams or university level, can actually showcase the intelligence, talent, creativity, knowledge or even the grasp of the student of the particular subject. Objectively looking at this question, the answer remains that no, the ‘rote learning’ prevalent in our education system does not provide a holistic reflection of the student’s abilities. The forementioned is also a driving reason why foreign universities admit students on criterion which put their actual ability to test ,and the academic grades merely provides an extra weightage ; this also holds true for professional courses, where students re let in through a system of assessment differing from their standard examination, and hence pushing the narrative that the grade cards of exams do not explore the potential of a student, and do not matter in the long run. HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC CHANGED THE SYSTEM?Everything has its own harms and benefits, and looking at the changes brought about during the pandemic, the inculcation of technology into education with all institutions working solely through screens and internet. This change had its own drawbacks, and was also not translated into examinations. Last year, the government mandatorily cancelled exams and held on to the importance of written examinations. Last year CBSE cancelled both 10th and 12th Board Exams and the students were scored on the basis of alternate assessment scheme, but the students dissatisfied with the same were given the opportunity to appear for the written examination in July. For the second time in a row CBSE has cancelled 10th board exams this year and the states of Telangana, Punjab, Haryana have followed the suit for their respective 10th State Board exams.In 2020, UGC led a legal battle against states for cancelling final exams in colleges. Ultimately Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of UGC and made final exams mandatory. The result of this act being loss of an year for the concerned students, roused by a predictable delay in the conduct of examinations and thereby culminating in the situation with students awaiting results past a year after their academic schedule.WHY IS THE CANCELLATION OF EXAMS BAD?If this trend of cancellation of examinations year after year is to continue, the academic competence will vanish slowly as the students will be derailed and will lack proper orientation without their academic advances being put to test constantly. There is an overall consensus that cancellation of examinations is not in the ‘best interest’ of the students.Possible avenue for judicial intervention is narrow in the case of cancellation of examinations unless, the judiciary steps beyond its borders with an aim to effect justice. Judicial review and power under Article 142 are the most effective options it can explore.The doctrine of judicial review is basically the authority of Judiciary to review the Legislative and Executive actions. It can extend to declaring these acts unconstitutional if it is in contravention to Fundamental Rights. The power of Judicial Review of High Courts is provided under Article 226 and 227 of the Indian Constitution. Article 32 as well as Article 136 of the Constitution prescribe the power of judicial review of Supreme Court. Article 142 empowers the court to pass any order necessary to do complete justice in a case. We see this power being widely employed in recent times. Moreover ,in this case ,this power can be used by courts to guide the existing education system to adopt new approaches and adapt to the times. Court can effectively question the current assessment criteria that works merely on memorization. Much needed transformation in education can be instigated. However in this case, if the court overturned the decision of government, the students would be forced to write the written exam and run the risk of succumbing to COVID-19. Moreover there is a unanimous opinion from all quarters that conducting a pan India written exam now is impossible.CONCLUSIONAs Winston Churchill once wrote, “Those that fail to learn from history are doomed to repeat it.” In 2021, as had been predicted, India is yet again in a surge of Covid-19 cases. Lat year, the exams had been cancelled as un unforeseen emergency, but this year exams are being cancelled and postponed due to lack of alternate efficient methods of assessment. Needless to say, cancellation of examinations is a necessity now, even though repeating this every year and making this a norm will be counterproductive. It is interesting to note that COVID has impacted the world equally, academic matters are going in full rigour globally. Hence, it would be ideal to not have the same remain standstill just in our country. It is advisable to explore the alternatives used in the rest of the countries and exercising the most fitting here. As it is said, whatever happens or changes “Life must go on”.

    "headline": "TKDL: A REVOLUTIONARY IMPACT ON THE IPR INDUSTRYTANZANIA CASE: A REFUGE OR PERILSub-Ordinate Judiciary affected by Inexperience at BarUnderstanding the concept of Quantum of Punishment in Court Martial Trails",
    "data": "This article has been written by Ipsita Rout from KIIT School of Law and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law.From Academics to Scholars, Students to Teachers, Doctors to Scientists – every profession on earth has had a history. An era where the struggles of man were only written in fine print or were folklore, man was still finding a way to channelize all the pieces of the puzzle and technology manoeuvred man this transformation. Like, they say, little knowledge is dangerous, with the advancement of time we are the future to dusty chalkboards. Books, old manuscripts, phonebooks, mail, journals, and more- all the information you need is a click away, digitalisation in every sector possible and the augment of AI has made everything much less sophisticated. In this article we shall visit the TRADITIONAL KNOWLEDGE DIGITAL LIBRARY (TKDL) that has taken the Intellectual Property Industry to an all-time summit. But, nothing that makes our lives easier has ever come without its challenges.INTRODUCTIONTraditional knowledge is the delicate and sacred information acquired and established by tribal groups which is passed from one community to another, and this consists of medicinal, agricultural and environmental experience. The nature of this information is sui generis and is open to threat due to danger to the identity of those tribes and communities. Traditional knowledge is distinct, and it is a hybrid between intellectual property and public domain, possessing characteristics and being subject to the constraints of both. Owing to the absence of qualities such as invention, recognizable owner, and so on, proprietary intellectual property rights (‘IPR’) cannot be held over such technology, it becomes part of the public domain, where it can be used. As a result, safeguarding conventional information has proved to be a difficult challenge.IMPACT AND IMPORTANCETraditional knowledge is described by the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) as “a growing body of knowledge passed down to the next generation within a community.” It is often a part of a person’s spiritual and cultural identity.’ Yoga or the medicinal powers of turmeric or tulsi, for example, would be part of our cultural wisdom for Indians. One of its distinguishing features is that this information has been passed on over the generations by word of mouth. It could be published anywhere or not. The Ministry of AYUSH (Ayurveda, Yoga and Naturopathy, Unani, Siddha and Homeopathy), in cooperation with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and the Centre for Scientific and Industrial Research, has launched the Traditional Knowledge Digital Library (TKDL) (hereinafter referred to as CSIR).It was enacted in 2001 to prohibit overseas patents being granted for conventional Indian knowledge. The library was founded after the Indian government had to expend a significant sum of taxpayer money to get a patent awarded to the University of Mississippi by the USPTO revoked. Protecting the unique expertise that developed countries like India possess is critical because it will allow them to make their development process more sustainable. It will assist them in achieving their desired socio-cultural success stages. The TKDL’s implementation and formulation also aided in the protection of our science from bio-piracy while also bringing common knowledge into the mainstream. It also made it possible for overseas patent offices to deny trademarks to those attempting to infringe on ethnic groups’ interests.Since it was established with the aim of helping indigenous peoples, TKDL has obtained significant funding from the government. Since it does not execute the other roles of an IPR regime, it currently serves only as a defensive weapon, as enticing as it can sound. In most cases, an IPR regime has a dual purpose: it protects intellectual property while also providing monetary compensation. The current TKDL architecture only serves one of the purposes of protecting information, but it does not have any incentives to its owners.CRITICISMFor starters, TKDL does not allow access to third parties, so there is little financial advantage to be gained from a contractual arrangement. Only the CSIR and the Patent Offices, who enter into the ‘Free Access Agreements,’ have a contractual arrangement. Second, it fails to benefit the real winners, the initial traditional wisdom holders, aboriginal peoples. Third, common information is not recognized by the TKDL as a part of the public domain that is not publicly available. As a result, commercialization is proposed to address the shortcomings of the current TKDL system. The primary goal of knowledge is to spread it, which can be obtained upon methodological foundation for selling conventional knowledge to third parties. Furthermore, commercialization will ensure the preservation of cultural knowledge while also benefiting aboriginal peoples financially. Traditional information commercialization has been debated before, but due to a lack of a protocol and a concrete record, it has never been prosecuted. However, with the existence of provisions for access value sharing under different treaties, as well as the BD Act and the TKDL, commercialization of common information under the TKDL can now be considered a possibility. Commercialization of information under the TKDL would result in financial gain, which could be put into the wellbeing of indigenous peoples.MODERN DAY THREATSTraditional knowledge, even as a resource to be communicated, is knowledge in and of itself, and thus has added value. Traditional wisdom is regarded as a shared property, and therefore its preservation is regarded as a shared responsibility that is easily overlooked by individual conscience. As a result, the need to defend, though felt, becomes a responsibility that others must fulfil. A person’s short-sightedness is what contributes to the loss of conventional wisdom, so this poses a significant challenge to its conservation and security.India’s experiment with defending traditional knowledge gained popularity in the early 1990s, sparked by fears of biopiracy, lack of access, and the catastrophe of the resources. This ultimately led to India’s TKDL initiative, which dates back to 1995, when two expatriate Indians at the University of Mississippi Medical Center applied for a patent for turmeric’s wound-healing properties. After the patent was awarded, the CSIR successfully contested it, arguing that this material was part of India’s common expertise and that seeking a patent for it would be biopiracy. As a result, the patent that had been awarded was revoked.A second patent lawsuit was contested along familiar ground by the Agricultural and Processed Food Exports Development Authority against the United States Patent Office in the matter of a patent to RiceTec, a US company that had submitted a request to name its brand of rice ‘Texmati,’ after the popular Indian Basmati. A patent for this rice variety was filed under the name “America’s Basmati.” Documents obtained by the Indian Agricultural Research Institute effectively refuted RiceTec’s arguments, demonstrating that the Basmati variety is part of India’s conventional expertise.CONCLUSIONThe scope of the TKDL is enormous, and it is perhaps the most significant step taken by the Indian government to preserve traditional information. It has the potential to act as an adhesive in reconciling indigenous peoples’ belief systems with the IPR Regime’s ideals, resulting in a technique that is feasible for all. "

Therefore, this petition has been filed to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India for seeking relief.Prayer Sought: The Petitioners through their learned counsels sought the following reliefs:● A direction to declare Kashmiri Pandits as “Internally Displaced Persons” within the meaning of the guiding principles on “Internally Displaced persons” adopted by ‘Office of the U.N High Commissioner for Human Rights’.● A direction to the respondents to investigate and prosecute cases of massacre and murders of the Kashmiri Pandits as submitted in the writ petition.● A direction to remove all encroachment on properties within the State of Jammu and Kashmir with a direction that properties, movable or immovable, sold by displaced persons after 1989-90 be declared as ‘Distress Sales’.● A direction to the State Government not to acquire any property owned by any Kashmiri Pandit without the prior concurrence of the Ministry of Home Affairs, Government of India.● A direction to provide permanent housing accommodation to all the Kashmiri minority migrants living in various parts of the country.Arguments by Respondents: The State of Jammu & Kashmir and the Government of India through their learned counsels filed a counter affidavit and a 407 pages rejoinder and Mr. Sunil Fernandes, learned counsel for the State of Jammu and Kashmir submitted that matters concerning relief and rehabilitation of Kashmiri migrants are being handled by the Relief and Rehabilitation Department of the Government which is located in Jammu itself and therefore, contented the petition to be transferred to Jammu & Kashmir.Decision by the Hon’ble Supreme Court:Having thoroughly heard the learned counsel for the parties, the court opined that it will be more appropriate if the petition is transferred to the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir at Jammu for hearing and disposal in accordance with law. As it will obviously be more convenient to both the parties to urge all such contentions as may be open to them before the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir at Jammu where the concerned departments and the relevant records are located and would be easily accessible . Thus the Hon’ble Court transferred the petition to the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir with a request to the Chief Justice of that Court to assign the matter to an appropriate Bench so that the same can be disposed off as expeditiously as possible and directed the parties to appear before the High Court of Jammu and Kashmir through their respective counsels with the dispatch of the Registry on record to the High Court at the earliest and without any costs to the parties."

In a world where almost more than 50 percent of the population is living in a situation of ‘hand to mouth’ can money not give them peace? Moreover, who thinks about peace in today’s world? The one who has money thinks of accumulating more of it and the ones not having it live in a dream of achieving it somehow, if not for them, then at least for their forthcoming generation. The former two mindsets however, are only responsible for creating a larger and larger gap between each other which is commonly known as the INCOME INEQUALITY, the major point of discussion of this article.Indian Statistics of Economic Distribution: As per a survey report published by OXFAM,titled “Public good or Private Wealth” in the year 2019, the top 10% of the Indian population holds 77% of the total national wealth. 73% of the wealth generated in 2017 went to the richest 1%, while 67 million Indians who comprise the poorest half of the population saw only a 1% increase in their wealth.There are 119 billionaires in India. Their number has increased from only 9 in 2000 to 101 in 2017. Between 2018 and 2022, India is estimated to produce 70 new milliBillionaires’ fortunes increased by almost 10 times over a decade and their total wealth is higher than the entire Union budget of India for the fiscal year 2018-19, which was at INR 24422 billionaires every day. Whereas, many ordinary Indians are not even able to access the health care they need. 63 million of them are pushed into poverty because of healthcare costs every year – almost two people every second.And if this process continues the statistics suggest that it would take approximately about 941 years for a minimum wage worker in rural India to earn what the top paid executive at a leading Indian company earns in a year. In the period between 2006 and 2015, ordinary workers saw their incomes rise by an average of just 2% a year while billionaire wealth rose almost six times faster. India has made substantial gains in health and education over the past few decades, but the picture is not uniformly positive. Disparities persist across social groups, states, and rural–urban areas, reflecting inequalities in opportunity to access basic services.The bottom 60% of the population holds only 4.8% of the national wealth.13.6 crore Indians, who make up the poorest 10% of the country, and have continuously remained in debt for the past 15 years.The Gini coefficient of wealth in India in 2017 is at 0.83, which puts India among the countries with highest inequality countries.The billionaire boom is not at all a sign of a thriving economy but a symptom of a failing economic system. Those working hard, growing food for the country, building infrastructure, working in factories are struggling to fund their child’s education, buy medicines for family members and somehow manage two meals a day. But on the other hand, the former are living a lavish life and not only that, have ensured the same luxury for their further generations as well.Issues to consider: Economic inequality is most disturbing when it is not the result of lack of efforts or talents, but instead is determined by the situations under which a child is raised. For example if, one child is able to go to a well-run grade school and high school and heads on to college, with parents supporting his education and other interests, paying for college, a vehicle, mobile phone, and also offer work connections that provides an opportunity to internships and jobs and there is an another child who attends a poorly run government grade school, barely makes it through a low-quality high school, does not go to college, and lacks family and peer support, these two children may have similarity in their capabilities and talents, also the effort they put forth may be alike too, but their economic outcomes are likely to be quite different. When we look at economic inequality from this perspective it becomes certain that the government has failed on the economic front, especially in the primary development of educational pillars and creation of jobs. There has been a rise in unemployment and lower participation of the labour force in the past couple of years that point towards low job creation. Another nail in the coffin is the corruption which has spread like an epidemic in the roots of our system, be it from any political party, elected leaders are corrupt and pass this to administration as well which is a very big problem in India.Further, there are important infrastructure-related governance issues due to the which half of the population suffers falling wages. Availability of water for irrigation is a major concern. Half of India’s agriculture depends on the monsoon for irrigation. The farmers continue to be in deep debt and hence ease of access to loans is a major concern. So in a sphere there is no single handed cause of this inequality generator but multiple of them entangled in each other.Repercussions and Comments: An indigent apparently seems to be but actually is not very welcome in any fronts of the society, be it social, administrative, or legal. Already suppressed by hunger and needs he finds a warfront in every aspect of societal anteriors. Let be a document to be made or a case to be registered or even a justified right is to be sought. He has a battlefield lying just next to his door and in some cases there’s no door as well. The end no. of governmental speeches and schemes have proven a vain for the righteous. The basic problem is the implementation and the building structure of the schemes. All the amenities that are put for an indigent class have already a comparatively compromised standard and till the time of reaching it gets impoverished. It’s high time that we ask ourselves a question, what is justifyingly more important? A kid going to school or a nation going to Mars, an ample three time food for a family daily or travelling in a bullet train, a person making lavish multiple floor car parking and servant quarters in his house or a roof to the ones who are compelled to die in footpaths everyday? The answer would be simple enough but no one chooses to deliver it. "

    "headline": "WOMEN ON BOARDS: A WORLD-WIDE GENDER INEQUALITY REIGNING FROM THE INSIDE IN THE CORPORATE INDUSTRYIs Hinduism a way of life or just a religion? SC to re-examine todayAN INTRODUCTION TO FIRIS SLAUGHTERING OF CAMELS IN THE NAME OF TRADITION ILLEGAL?",
    "data": "This article is written by Ipsita Rout, 4th Year student of KIIT School of Law and curated by Himanshu Raj of CNLU Patna.INTRODUCTIONCorporate boards are critical governing and management bodies and their productivity dictates the success of a corporation. The board is a central aspect of the framework of corporate governance and the effectiveness of the management and monitoring of the organization is measured by its productivity and profitability. The board is used as a liaison between equity suppliers (shareholders) and executives who use this money to extract value. The task of the board is to represent, formulate and satisfy shareholders’ wishes and desires as the owners of the businesses. Inevitably, the controversy surrounding female representation in industry must relate to their inclusion on corporate boards. It is also a credible measure of the agenda and development of gender equality embraced by countries and businesses.ISSUESIn a survey by catalyst workplaces that work for women, it was found that globally only 20% of directors were women in 2019, which was an increase of 2.1 % from the previous year. Women are not just facing gender discrimination in but their work spheres but are condemned for their lack of physical fitness, are already labelled as token in the board dynamic industry. Tokens are a visual reminder of how the company believes in diversity across all genders, but when you scrutinize and look into the matter in general, you will find that the tenure of the women is lower than that of male employers. There are still differences in pay grade and the choice of women is only done to showcase that the company is following no gender discrimination for its recruitments.In 2019, Australia had 31.2% women on boards, Canada had 29.1%, France had 44.3%, Germany had 33.3%, India had 15.9%, Japan had 8.4%, Netherlands had 34.0%, Sweden had 39.6%, Switzerland had 29.9%, United Kingdom had 31.7% and the United States of America had 26.1% women on the boards. (Catalyst global survey 2020)The above statistics however do show an increase of the percentage of women on boards in all the countries from the previous years, but you can notice that the representation of women is not something that is taken seriously in the corporate industry.WHAT CAN BE DONE?According to Victoria Medvec, Professor of Management and Organisations, Kellongg School of Management – Companies are keen to add female directors as board recruiters would gladly report their female hires. Nevertheless, there are also professional woman executives who ask, “Why isn’t my phone ringing?” “This is the aspect of the mechanism that should be proactive for women. Unless a woman is a sitting CEO, being selected as a director nominee involves honing a “value proposition,” which is the special value she adds to a board, a widely coveted expertise that speaks for itself.But the irony is, rather than the CEO, there are also men sitting on boards that hold senior leadership roles. And why, then, in terms of board service, are women held to a particular, higher standard? The sad reality of corporate life may be one reason why men are always rewarded on the basis of their ability, while women are promoted on the basis of their achievements. Therefore, if women have not proved themselves as CEOs first, they might be less likely to be accepted as candidates for director.Unfortunately, all the progress that we need for women in the corporate industry will take years to reach. However, this slowness hides what I consider to be true change. Women occupied 15.7 percent of board seats in large corporations in 2010; today, it has risen to about 20 percent. But there has been a much greater rise in female directors than the figures at first sight would reveal. A decade earlier, sitting on as many as six or seven boards was not unusual for directors. The women who also sat on several boards were counted many times, in effect (as were their male counterparts). Today, directors are sitting on smaller boards due to more strict compliance criteria, such as Sarbanes-Oxley. This suggests that there are far more actual female directors in the mix, which reflects a positive trend in the diversity of board gender diversity. The approach should not be mandatory requirement specific, rather merit specific. This is where the ‘Value Proposition’ concept checks out.CONCLUSIONWhen you buy a packet of chips, dates or fruits in the market what do you see first? We check the expiry date at the back, the nutrient content, the quality, and the packaging, right? Just like that the board recruiters look at the value that you can add to the company and how you manage the reputation of the company when everything goes south. True that woman does not have a minimum of 50% representation of boards globally and as tragic as this fact is, there is something that can be done about it. Leading by example is always something that makes your answer have safety. When you have more information and experience on something nobody can question you on your methods, you are not a beginner rather and expert on your research- the idea of value proposition adds more value and favourability to cause a woman to be ideal candidate for a position in the board. It is our turn to take back what’s ours as women, and change the boardroom dynamics. The sad part is few women cannot do it alone, but all of us together can make this reality and take back what’s integral for the development of the board dynamics. Years across from here, future researchers will study about the movement that began with the idea and birth itself to reality. Progress is just a mile away. "

    "data": "This article has been written by Ipsita Rout from KIIT School of Law and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law.India. Population 136.64 Crores, almost 18% of the world’s population which people are not usually aware of, which also has a silver medal right after china when it comes to the most number of people or population in a country. But, how is all this related to the context of consensual intercourse? It is relevant because amongst all these ethnicities, religions, cultures and age groups- we have the toddlers, who one day become kids, and then one day those kids become adolescents. And that’s exactly the age that we are targeting in this article.So why should adolescents or children going to the beautiful journey of puberty, not be treated as consenting parties to have intercourse? The following are the reasons for which, having consensual intercourse between the age of 16-18 should be illegal-1. The augment of experimental curiosity, can lead to STDS. Sexually transmitted diseases can change someone’s premature, not well thought out situation and have major life turning crisis or consequences.2. The psychology of children, irrespective of their gender or who they identify as, is still not the best version of themselves. That’s why they are not allowed to legally drink until they are 21. This isn’t a comparison to highlight the legal age to drinking and such age to have consensual intercourse, rather, elucidating the fact that certain irreversible choices can have a traumatic experience to how a person either identifies themselves or how they feel about making major life decisions.3. This expands the argument from sexual abuse to not knowing what abuse is or what situations identify as an abuse. You’re 16, and all you think about is how to be popular at school or how to do better in that one team. The world is everything your imagination wants you to be, and you get subjected to things and do not have the mature moral compass to decide. What behavioral patterns are correct and what are not? What happens if a 16 (female) year-old gets pregnant with a child? We do not have social services like the US in our country to safeguard from parental abuse. The parents are going to pressure for an abortion. The male adolescent is going to run away from the responsibility from having to deal with it and this episode is going to forever haunt the mind of the female and her family. How is that logically appropriate, should we not encourage adolescents to have enough knowledge before they become parties to consensual intercourse?4. The education system in our country is restrictive, and talking about sexual intercourse in public is still frowned upon and with preexisting stories like the boys locker room incidents and cyber-bullying, children today struggle school to maintain a decent reputation.What happens if lack of knowledge shapes either one of the consenting parties to experience trauma and compare any such incident to future conduct of safe intercourse?5. Between the age of 16-18, having consensual intercourse and not following the traditional methods, is going to take a toll on both adolescents and their families. This is also correlated with the majority of youth before 25 years having STDs, STIs, HIV, AIDS etc., as a consequence of unprotected sexual intercourse even after being consenting parties.6. Children between the age of 18, often suffer from emotional gaps with their parents- this is not subject to the parenting style, rather something that cannot be forced to shape with education. Thereby, they do things that lead them to hiding facts of truth and this includes adolescents who have consensual intercourse, and not having the support of their biological/adoptive parents meanwhile society frowning- takes a real toll on one’s mental wellness and well-being.7. Struggling with their gender or who they identify as, sexual orientation- adolescents who are still deciding whether they identify as a member of the LGBTQ+ community, adolescents who have consensual intercourse suffer from social ostracization from their peers at school and the gap of understanding with parents shapes a person to go through long term consequences, like deciding to be introvert and not outgoing, involving themselves in gangster acts die to being singled out as drugs and turning into law breaking citizens as a result of chronic social ostracization.The above are just a few of the many reasons, why children between the age of 16-18 should not be allowed to have sexual intercourse irrespective of consent. Because, the fact stays fact, that in that situation and premature moral compass one cannot fathom what it means to give consent or what they might be subjected to pressure, or if they know the long term consequences. Would this change with sexual education in schools and lack of social ostracization? Maybe, but you can never know for sure. Children are like flowers, they are filled with hope and innocence. It is our responsibility as adults to not encourage their mental well-being or wellness to be discarded or be brutally misused by letting them do what they deem fit. Therefore, the author of this article stands for protecting the youth and innocence of adolescents across the globe by taking a stand that sexual intercourse in between the age of 16-18 should not be legal.

    "headline": "UNWINDING THE DISCRIMINATORY DRESS CODES FOR FEMALE IN INDONESIANEW RULES ON CATTLE TRADESTANDING AT THE WAKE OF DEVASTATION: AHMADI MUSLIMS IN PAKISTANWhat is a Public Interest Litigation?",
    "data": "This article has been written by IPSITA ROUT, 4th Year, KIIT SCHOOL OF LAW and curated by Nandita Mishra, Chanakya National Law University, PatnaWHAT IS THIS ARTICLE ABOUT?In a report released on 18th march, Human Rights Watch reported that dress codes for women and girls in Indonesia discriminate against students, civil servants, and visitors to government offices and should be repealed. The government should thoroughly enact a decree released in February 2021 that forbids abusive dress codes for female students and teachers in Indonesian public schools, as well as take additional legislative action to eradicate sexism against women and children.WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?Local governments and school principals were expected to abolish all obligatory jilbab legislation under the new decree. Since March 5, the legislation has been in force. According to the news, any local authority head or school principal who did not comply by March 25 will face penalties. The government should fully implement a decree issued in February 2021 that prohibits abusive dress codes for female students and teachers in Indonesian public schools, as well as take additional legal measures to eliminate discrimination against women and girls.At least 60 laws and regulations discriminating on the basis of dress code have been enacted at the national, state, and provincial levels in the Asian country since 2001. The “dress code,” according to human rights campaigners and non-governmental groups, is a sign of growing religious bigotry and conservative attitudes in a world that, at least officially, acknowledges six religions (including Catholicism), but where Sunni Muslims make up more than 85 percent of the population.Since the national government introduced school uniform regulations in 2014, “many regencies and provinces interpreted [the suggestion that a jilbab should be worn] as mandatory, so you had the circumstance where local education officers and public schools began to amend the school rules and to enforce the jilbab (hijab) as part of the school uniforms,” according to Elaine Pearson, the Australia diaspora coordinator. This was particularly true in more conservative areas like West Sumatra and Central Java, where non-Muslims were subjected to the same dress code as Muslims. Aceh, Indonesia’s only province where Sharia, or Islamic law, is applied, is no exception. HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH ACTIVITYAccording to the National Commission on Violence Against Women, 32 regencies and provinces throughout the archipelago now mandate girls and women to wear jilbabs (hijabs) in public schools, government offices, and other public spaces. For a law that isn’t meant to be binding, young women have been humiliated by getting their hair shaved, being suspended from colleges, being penalized, or being dismissed from their careers.According to the HRW article, a new decree banning public schools in the Muslim-majority world from imposing religion-based dress codes – such as headscarves and long skirts – prohibits Islamic schools and women serving in the civil service and government offices. “In many parts of Indonesia, women and girls have faced unparalleled legal and social demands to wear clothing considered Islamic over the past two decades as part of wider attempts to enforce Sharia rules,” according to the study. According to the study “‘I Wanted to Run Away’: Abusive Dress Codes for Women and Girls in Indonesia,” “these tensions have risen considerably in recent years.”CONCLUSIONOnly state schools managed by local councils and the Ministry of Education and Culture are covered by the decree. It has little effect on the Religious Affairs Ministry’s Islamic state schools and universities. It also excludes Aceh province, which has more autonomy than the other provinces due to a special agreement and is the only province that formally observes Sharia, or Islamic rule. International human rights legislation respects people’s rights to openly share their religious views, freedom of speech, and fair access to education. Women have the same privileges as men, including the freedom to dress anything they choose. Any restrictions on these rights must be justified and enforced in a nondiscriminatory and non arbitrary way. Mandatory jilbab statutes, such as those in Aceh, also jeopardize girls’ and women’s fundamental rights to be free “from unfair treatment based on any grounds whatsoever.” Since the Indonesian government introduced a Muslim dress code in 2001, there has been systematic bullying against girls and women who do not follow it. Because of the constant requirement to dress like Muslim women, girls have been expelled or expelled from school, and female employees have lost or given up their jobs as a result of noncompliance. They have also endured psychological trauma as a result of the pressures to adapt. This practice is a death of freedom as a decision to represent is synonymous to one’s identity. In the coming years, this decree will lead to violence and break the society in pieces. "

    "headline": "Scrutinizing the Adamant Boundaries of Consensual Sex: What is to be considered an ideal age?Understanding the concept of Quantum of Punishment in Court Martial TrailsWHERE IS THE LINE OF HUMANITY WHEN ONE IS A PRISONER?Environmental Law Bare Acts",
    "data": "This article is written by Vijeta Mahara, a law graduate from Chanakya Law College, Rudrapur, Uttarakhand and curated by Himanshu Raj of CNLU Patna.Prelude: In India ‘Sex’ is a still taboo that peoples neither talk about nor open up easily. Even in today’s era parents feel awkward discussing puberty and sex education, but, the biggest question is- who will decide the age of adulthood, The Law, society, State or biological factors? We have a different age of adulthood for different things. Indian Majority Act prescribes majority at 18, age for casting vote is 18; driving is 16-18, for drinking is 18, 21, 23, 25 ; adoption can be done at 21; work age is 14; and age for marriage is18 (for girls) and 21 for (boys).As the societal atmosphere is ever-evolving, the level of maturity whether mental or biological is constantly evolving with it, however, the way, the age of consent is interpreted and applied in our country is definitely a matter of concern because we tend to forget that the society is dynamic, which needs to change with time to survive. Ours is a society where unrestricted flaunt of love and affection is still frowned upon. But if we look at human history, whatever does not change with the changing time, ultimately results in failure, and the same is with the set boundaries of physical needs. In today’s progressive world at the age of 16, a boy or girl is completely able to differentiate between rights and wrong, the person by the age of 16 has acquired a notion of higher self. But being a stubborn society we don’t like to break the boundaries and think beyond.World Statistics: In India, the age of consent is 18. Most places in the US set it at between 16 and 18 and through Romeo-Juliet laws eliminate or minimize the punishment if the age difference between partners is minute, in Angola, its 12, in Canada it is 16 but 14-15 can have sex with someone who is up to five years older. Argentina and Japan set the bar at 13. In Iran, to have sex you should be married, so you can be teenager having sex with 40 yr old husband as well and that’s legal! Sweden’s age of consent is 15, however, according to UNICEF, most countries have chosen to set the age of consent at 16 years. Studies across the world have established that children are attaining puberty earlier than before. There are reports confirming early initiation of children into sexual activities. Early sexual activity is directly attributable to the greater exposure that children nowadays have. All sorts of adult content and pornographic material is easily accessible online. A belief that it is too early for those between 16 and 18 to engage in intercourse is well-founded but most of the adults in different surveys admit having sex before the age of 18. Thus, keeping in mind all these perspectives, before discussing the age of consent with respect to sexual acts, there must be a clear understanding of the phrase “age of consent” which refers to an age where an individual is considered competent to understand the consequences of engaging in sexual activity with a free will.Fallouts of a setting a higher age: It is pertinent to note that the forbidden fruit is always more lucrative and severe restrictions serve to fuel curiosity. It is really convenient for adults to put curbs on teenage sexuality rather than deal with related issues. The teenagers are already under an overdrive of hormones and when they are strictly refused of their urges there is a backlash. There are many well known cases around each one of us where the desire for togetherness compels young couples to elope and in most cases, the girl’s family legally frames the boy, young couples are harassed by false cases of rape against their partners, which in fact is not rape and is a teenage romance. Section 375 and 376 of the Indian Penal Code are frivolously applied in cases to restore the family’s honour ignoring the consensual relationships. The idea of consent should be the same for all genders and the minimum age should reflect the capacity, age and maturity of the child. In India itself, a kid from 7-12 years is considered ‘Doli-Capax’ and after the 2013 amendment, in sexual offences, post 16 can be treated as an adult. So what we actually need is to guide the future generation but putting an absolute bar will lead to undesirable consequences. By legalizing a set higher age of consent we are criminalizing even consensual sexual activities and since it portrays illegal they are denied access to protective measures as well as safe medical procedures. We are duty bound to protect our children from unhealthy activities at their age as well as unnecessary prosecutions and punishments and that is only possible if we become more flexible with their changing needs.The Legal Chronicle: The Madras High Court in a recent judgment suggested that consensual sex, physical contact or allied acts after the age of 16 be excluded from the ambit of POCSO Act and the definition of “child” under Section 2(d) of the Act be amended and reduced to 16 instead of 18 years on which Senior Advocate Vikas Pahwa stated “Considering the innovation in digital technology, the children are exposed to so much of information that they get matured much earlier and thus are in a position to give consent for any relationship even at the age of 16,” He also opined that this will also reduce the number of criminal cases pending in various courts, where the provisions of the Act are grossly misused as even when a girl in the intermediate age of 16-18 gives consent. Senior Advocate Geeta Luthra had recently stated that today’s adolescents, especially those who have attained the age of 16 are mentally fit and capable to take a call with respect physical contact. In 2017, the High Court of Himachal Pradesh in the case of State of Himachal Pradesh vs. Varinder Kumar passed an order wherein they dismissed the rape charges after concluding that both the parties had consented to sexual intercourse from when they were minors until they had attained majority. Also, in the case of State of MP vs. Munna, the Supreme Court held that consensual sex by a girl who is more than 16 years of age cannot be termed as rape.Corollary: Teenagers in the 16 to 18 years bracket are sexually active and there is no point in suppressing tendencies when we have an option to handle it carefully. It is important to lower the age of consent and establish the age difference of 3 to 5 years between the consensual young couple. This would ultimately ensure that an older person does not take undue advantage of a young girl. Such an amendment in law, could offer protection to the young 16-year-old girl from sexual exploitation and harassment. A society can only become a better place when biological requirements are also accepted as a fact like any other need and not as a taboo. If Puberty and other biological changes are happening before 18 years of age then medically and scientifically sex can be also performed before that, therefore keeping a consent age without considering scientific facts and dynamic evolutions of society places sex as a forbidden act which actually is a need. Therefore, raising the age limit for sex by consent to 18 years would be unconstitutional as well as regressive in nature but also a step in the backward direction."

    "headline": "An overview on Ranjit Thakur v Union of IndiaProf. N.R. MADHAVA MENON- Father of Modern Education in India.DISCUSSION HOUR: DEMONETIZATIONCOVID -19: Quarantine and your Legal Rights",
    "data": "This article has been written by Dakshita Sharma Katare, Sushant University, Gurugram and curated by Himanshu Raj of CNLU, Patna.The Concept behind the CaseThe legal case of Ranjit Thakur v Union of India 1987 AIR 2386 is a case pertaining to Summary Court Martial.Court Martial literally means a trial conducted in a military court or tribunal. In India, Court Martial is of four types, namely as- GCM, DCM, SGCM and SCM. Here, GCM stands for General Court Martial, DCM stands for District Court Martial, SGCM’s full form is Summary General Court Martial and SCM stands for Summary Court Martial. All the four of them have been defined along with their powers and features mentioned in the Army Act, 1950.Summary Court Martial or SCM is the ground level court martial procedure with some features entirely unique to its own. It has been constituted to look after the issues of smaller nature. Its function is to punish the accused (a member of Indian Army), a soldier for any legal offence committed by him/her other than murder or rape of a civilian. The trial of these two offences is conducted in the regular courts, like any other citizen of India. It has the authority to sentence the offender in a grave manner, except giving a capital punishment and a long term imprisonment. It has the power to award with the punishment of imprisonment up to one year, if the officer conducting the SCM is of a rank Lieutenant Colonel or above and up to three months, if the officer conducting the SCM is of a rank Major or below. Any Commanding Officer of the corps, department or detachment to which the accused belongs can hold his/her SCM. That Commanding Officer solely constitutes the court and acts both as a judge and prosecutor. This power granted to the Commanding Officer has led to the biased and disproportionate judgements in the SCM. This power had been granted to maintain strictness and army discipline. But now, many feel that their rights are being hampered with, with all the supreme powers vested in the hands of the Commanding Officer who conducts the Summary Court Martial. Though the SCM is also attended by two other officers or Junior Commissioned Officers, yet they have no say in the proceedings and play almost no part in it.In addition to this, in a SCM, the accused is not entitled with some counsel or defending officer in order to defend himself. But he is permitted to take the help of a friend in assisting him during the proceedings for defence purposes.By and large, the system or the pattern followed in Summary Court Martials has led to a discontentment to those who have been martialed. This has led to several notable cases of appeal in the High Court and Supreme Court related SCM. One such case is Ranjit Thakur v Union of India.Scenario: The Layout of the CaseIn this case, Ranjit Thakur had sent a representation to the higher officers, in which he complained about the ill-treatment of his commanding officer towards him. This act of his was deemed to be an offence; hence by Section 80 of the Army Act 1950, he was given a rigorous punishment of being held handcuffed in the guard cell for 28 days. While serving this punishment, he committed another offence, this time of not obeying a lawful command given by his senior officer. He had not eaten the food he was ordered to eat by Subedar Ram Singh. By Section 41 (2) of the Act, he was summary court martialed for his act, just the next day of his commission of second offence, by his commanding officers in the presence of two officers junior to the latter. The result of the SCM was that not only did he plead guilty, but also was sentenced with an yearlong rigorous imprisonment along with being dismissed from the service by the addition of clause that he was unfit for any future civil employmentFor relief, he used Article 164 of the Act to gain remedy from the General Officer Commanding who rejected his appeal. He then appealed to the High Court which too granted no relief and rejected his appeal. Hereafter, he moved to the Supreme Court by filing a Special Leave Petition.Guiding Factors: The Aforementioned Sections of the Army Act 1950The Section 41 (2) of the Indian Army Act 1950 states that in case of disobedience of a lawful command of a superior officer, the offender is liable to be convicted by court martial.The Section 80 of the same Act mentions the punishment to be given to any soldier except officers, JCOs and warrant officers. These include imprisonment in military custody, detention or confinement up to 28 days, extra guards or duties, deprivation of position (nature of appointment/ rank/ pay), severe reprimand or remand, fine (up to 14 day’s pay of a month), penal deductions, any field punishment up to 28 days.The Section 164 of the Act provides with the means to gain remedy against an order, finding or sentence of court martial. It mentions the procedure to gain the remedy and the authority from whom the remedy can be asked for.Verdict: The Decision of the CourtThe Supreme Court decided that the participation of the Commanding Officer had rendered the proceedings Coram non-judice which means “not before a judge” (i.e., the legal proceedings took place without jurisdiction and in the absence of the judge). In addition to this, the Apex Court also stated that the punishment was strikingly disproportionate to the offence committed by the appellant. Hence, the court allowed the appeal and quashed the proceedings and the subsequent orders of the Summary Court Martial. Also, the court ordered that appellant should be provided with all the monetary and service benefits once again, but it decided to not grant him the compensation for the one year long rigorous imprisonment already undergone by him.Conclusion: The Critical AnalysisThis case clearly reflects the rigidity and strictness of the Army rules and is a proof to the fact that the immense power in the hands of the Commanding Officer during SCM can be misused. The SC judgment is a motivation for all those who faced biased verdicts in SCM. The SC verdict is just in every aspect as it respects the Army Act 1950 and thus, does not allow compensation for the imprisonment. But it does consider the other orders disproportionate as relieving the appellant from service along with rendering him unfit for any civil service is too harsh and of greater magnitude than decided even by the statute.It is commendable that the Supreme Court has looked into the matter of disproportionate punishment and relieved the appellant by providing him justice.

    "data": "Ex. Naik Sardar Singh vs Union Of India And Others[1]– Ipsita Rout, 4th Year, KIIT School of LAW Curated by Nandita Mishra, Chanakya National Law UniversityBACKGROUND In the current case the author attempts to lift the curtain on a court martial case of an Army Jawan who is charged with carrying liquor outside the premises of the base without permit. Was he liable for the charges? What provision was he charged under? And how did he plead in this case? The answer to all your questions lay at the end of this article. This case is an example of two things- Firstly, the shift of a case from the Summary Court Martial Trial to High Court to the Supreme Court of India. Secondly, the understanding of the quantum of punishment justifiable by law in Court Martial Trial. PARTIES TO THIS CASE The petitioner of this case is Ex. Naik Sadar Singh[2], and the Respondent is the Union of India & Others. A SHORT NOTE ON THE FACTS OF THE CASE X had to attend a family function for which he had brought 12 liquor bottles from the csd canteen, and was caught in a police area where his liquor bottles were confiscated. After checking it was found that he was carrying 7 extra liquor bottles without permit. The Summary Court trial sentenced him to 3 months of rigorous imprisonment and he was further dismissed from the service. X made a case of sparkling record with the army for 10 years, and said that an incorrect sentence had been passed against him, further, the proceedings of the summary trial had irregularities and were not conducted in prescribed order and took the case to Delhi High Court. The High court accepted X’s writ petition and looked into the matter, & gave the order that X’s plea of proceedings not being conducted in reasonable order was false after the scrutiny of all the evidence collected in the former trial. However, the high court did concur to his plea that the punishment was harsher in nature and a remand of a lesser sentence as per section 72 of the Army Code of 1950. X then went on to file a Special leave petition in the Hon’ble Supreme court of India and which was accepted. PROVISIONS OF THE CASE SECTION 63, 71 & 72 of the Army Code of 1950. This case is a manifestation of the offence by X under Section 63 which deals with the violation of good order and discipline under the code. Section 71 which deals with the punishments of situations where the court-martial trial awards possible punishments, holds clauses ‘a’ to ‘f’, which is important for the establishment that, the quantum of punishment varies from circumstance to circumstance, and it is the duty of the court martial to award appropriate punishment. It is important to note that Section 63 cannot be passed without keeping in mind the spirit of Section 72 of the code, which provides for alternative punishments by the court-martial after construing that the degree of the offence was low in its nature. RELEVANT CASES IN LIEU OF THE FINAL DECISION Ranjit Thakur v. Union of India and Others (1987), Bhagat Ram v. State of Himachal Pradesh (1983), & Council of Civil Service Unions v. Minister for the Civil Service, (1984). DECISION BY THE COURT The final judgement of this case was passed by Judge K. Jayachandra Reddy of the Hon’ble Supreme court of India. The court held that X was just a man who had bad luck on the day where he was caught by the civil police. He was in possession of eleven bottles of sealed rum & one of brandy, where he could only show the record of 5 validly purchased liquor. He must have had referral/chits by the higher authority to obtain the other bottles, otherwise, it was impossible for him to have them under his possession. In lieu of all the circumstances of the case, Judge Reddy, ordered the Court-martial to reinstate him in the army and his dismissal was cancelled under Section 72. However, he was awarded a lesser punishment as deemed fit to his circumstance under Section 63, but it was held that the award of 3 months of rigorous imprisonment and dismissal of service under Section 71 was too harsh a punishment in X’s case by the court-martial. The case was then dismissed. ANALYSIS This case is an extraordinary precedent to show that there are degrees to the quantum of punishment in court martial trials just like criminal law crimes. One can compare the degrees of murder and the execution of justice carried out in this beautifully written judgement by Judge Reddy. This case is an example of holding the incorrect behaviour responsible and also keeping in mind that the impact of all incorrect behaviour however, in the light of bad is to be punished but, at the same time, it also is to be scrutinized in lieu of the nature of the offence committed by a person. After understanding the facts and the judgement given in this case, the author would like to conclude that the justification given by the bench holds valid as, the dismissal of service of the appellant was a harsher punishment for being caught in a police area. And reinstating the appellant alongside guaranteeing a lesser punishment was the right track of carrying justice in a court martial trial in pursuance of Section 63, 71& 72 of the Army Code. 1950.[1] 1992 AIR 417, 1991 SCR (2) 676. [2] Here and after for the purposes of this article named X."

    "data": "Can Prejudice Surpass Principles of Natural Justice? The Bench:Lord DenningEdmund Davis (LJ) Parties to the Suit:Freshwater Group of Companies (Petitioner) here referred to as FGCMr.John Lannon and others (Respondent) Cases Referred:R v SussexR v Barnsley County Borough LicensingR v Camborne Principles Involved:Justice should both be done and be manifestly seen to be donePrinciples of Natural justice – Rule against biasTests of Reasonable suspicion and Real likelihood of bias Issues to be Determined:Whether Mr. Lannon should have sat in the Rent Assessment Committee?Whether Mr. Lannon had any direct pecuniary interest in the subject matter of the suit?Whether Mr. Lannon was biased towards one of the parties to the suit? Facts of the Case:A metropolitan township Oakwood Court was purchased by the petitioner, FGC, who post purchase, proposed to increase the rent of the flats. After which some of the tenants applied to the rent officer to register a ‘fair rent’ under the Rent Act 1965. The rent officer fixed a rent that he ought to be a ‘fair rent’. The Petitioner, however, unsatisfied, appealed to the rent assessment committee against the decision. The committee made drastic reductions in the rents. They put the fair rent as far lower than the contractual rents, in fact lower than any of the experts stated, and lower, indeed, than the tenants themselves had offered. Aggrieved, the petitioner took the case to the Divisional Court and made a complaint against the respondent, Mr John Lannon, the chairman of the assessment committee. The petitioner alleged that the respondent was disqualified as he was a solicitor living in another block of flats ‘The Regency Lodge’ owned by the FGC where his father was the tenant and was in dispute with the FGC. The petitioner further alleged that the son was assisting and advising his father in the matter and on account of this,ought not to have sat on the hearing as he could not have been delivered a fair and unbiased decision. Arguments Advanced:On Jan. 13, 1967, Mr John Lannon assisted his father in writing that letter in his dispute with the Petitioner, still on Jan. 19, 1967, he sat as chairman of the rent assessment committee to hear an appeal by that very group.On Apr. 26, 1967, the committee gave their decision and fixed the rents for Oakwood Court lower than anyone had submitted to themAnd, therefore, it was contented that this has been a biased decision in which the principle of natural justice has been violated by the respondent. The Code:A person can be disqualified from sitting in a judicial capacity on anyone of two grounds:A direct pecuniary interest in the subject matter orBias in the favour of any of the parties. Findings of the Divisional Court:It was acknowledged that Mr John Lannon did not actually have any direct pecuniary interest in the suit, the only possible interest he could have was his father’s interest in being a tenant of Regency Lodge, in getting the rent to be reduced so if the committee reduced the rents of Oakwood Court, those rents could be used for comparing the rents in Regency Lodge, and might lead them to be put lower than they otherwise would be. However, even if the son’s interest with the father’s is directly identified, this seems to be too remote. And so far as the bias is concerned, it is clear that there was no actual bias on the part of Mr Lannon, and certainly no want of good faith. But indeed, there was, a regardless unconscious, a real likelihood of bias and this is a matter on which the law is not altogether clear. Mr. Lannon was himself a tenant in difference with his landlord , that too, about the rent of a flat, although, another flat. In this case he was not a tenant, but the son of a tenant, but that makes no difference.A prudent man cannot draw any distinction between him and his father, especially when he was living with him and assisting him with his case. Judgment:Lord Denning emphasised on the clear non- appearance of bias, and found it needless to enquire whether the respondent was partial as it served that reasonable people might think he did. The reason being unpretentious that justice must be rooted in confidence and confidence pulls down when right-minded people have a slight chance of thinking that “The judge was biased”.Edmund Davies further stated that when ‘real likelihood’ and ‘reasonable suspicion’ tests are inconsistent with each other, the former has to be preferred. The public interest can never be served by relaxing the conditions under which it may be assumed by the people that there had been a bias, since, “justice should not only be done, but should manifestly be seen to be done”.Thus, the court referring to the above mentioned cases applied the test of reasonable likelihood as the test of reasonable suspicion failed and ruled that however, there is no direct pecuniary interest or bias that can be proved, still, Mr Lannon should not have sat in the committee, and quashed the decision. Inference Drawn:An aggrieved party reaches to the Court with a ‘Hope’ that the wrongdoing would be amended and justice would be served to him, there is a faith that a “Court” is an institution which is established on the firm foundation of Principles of Natural Justice and it will, no matter what, be purely impartial and honest. But that trust is shaken when there buds out even a petite probability of prejudice. Clearly this decision of the Divisional Court has been put forth keeping the above fact in mind and upholding the principle that., “No man can be an advocate for or against a party in one proceeding, and at the same time sit as a judge of that party in another proceeding”.

    "headline": "STANDING AT THE WAKE OF DEVASTATION: AHMADI MUSLIMS IN PAKISTANACID ATTACK: NATURE OF PROVISIONS SINCE THE DAY OF ITS EVOLUTIONIndia Ratifies Two ILO Conventions On International Day Against Child LaborShould the Death Penalty be Abolished in India?",
    "data": "This article has been written by Ipsita Rout, a 4th year student from KIIT School of Law and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law.WHO ARE AHMADIS?The Ahmadiyya community was formed by Mirza Ghulam Ahmad, the father and founder of the sect who was born in 1835. He believed that he had received a divine message that he was the promised Messiah and the anticipated Mahdi, whom most Muslims believe would appear at the end of the day to bring about Islam’s final triumph. When Ghulam Ahmad accepted the pledge of allegiance offered to him on Mar. 23, 1889 by his companions, the sect emerged.Ahmadis recognize themselves as Islam’s promised second rise; the second rise of the Muslim community linked to the Koran’s projected first generation of Muslims; the Prophet Muhammad’s predicted surviving party of Muslims; and leaders of the second Orthodox caliphate. They do not present themselves as a religious movement or an ideology that originated in reaction to other political sects, nor do they consider themselves to be a religiously veiled political party aspiring to promote their own interests. They believe that, they are the last community of believers that emerged by order of God after Muslims deviated from the proper direction and Islam became a soulless body, and that by believing in God and the Prophet Muhammad, their aim is to alleviate humanity’s misery and pain and establish security and peace in the world.It is seen as deviating from Islam by critics of the sect who believe Ghulam Ahmad to have wrongly assumed prophecy by claiming he is the Messiah. They also argue that under the justification that they are ‘guardians who should be obeyed,’ he founded his sect to serve the Colonial rule and avoid fighting the British. This criticism is based on a letter sent to the British ruler of India in 1898 which attributed to Ghulam Ahmad stating, ‘I have been striving with my tongue and pen since I was young to intensify the course of Muslims on the British government and to wipe out the notion of jihad, which is accepted by some of the ignorant Muslims.HISTORICAL BACKGROUNDThe Ahmadiyya group was declared a non-Muslim minority in 1974 by a constitutional amendment adopted by Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s government. In general, this move was interpreted as a response to pressure from orthodox Muslim groups to circumscribe the Ahmadis’ activities. On July 5, 1977, President Zia-ul-Haq came to power in a military coup which overthrew Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto’s government. With the proclaimed intention of turning Pakistan into a profound Islamic society, he initiated a program of ‘Islamization’. In enforcing restrictions on the Ahmadiyya minority, some analysts saw President Zia as reacting to tension from Islamic fundamentalist groups on whom he was deemed to depend on his government for help. Fundamentalist mullahs [Islamic scholars] reportedly warned in early 1984 that if no further action was taken against Pakistan there would be infringement of Ahmadis’ human rights by Apr. 30, 1984 and if the 1974 constitutional amendment were not rigorously implemented, Ahmadi places of worship would be targeted and the targets of attacks would become members of the group.President Zia-ul-Haq enacted Ordinance XX on Apr. 26, 1984. The Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) was modified by the Ordinance, which introduced Sections 298-B and 298-C, rendering it a criminal offense for Ahmadis to declare themselves Muslims, to use terminology and appellations synonymous with the Prophet, to use Muslim rituals in worship or to spread their religion. Section 298 of the PPC deals with the criminal offense of “uttering words, etc with specific intent to damage religious feelings”; Section 298-A deals with the use of derogatory statements, etc in reference of holy personages”.PLIGHT TO THE COMMUNITY OF AHMADIS IN PAKISTANOver the course of time, the Ahmadi Muslims in Pakistan have dealt with a series of transgression on part of the government, police, military and society which has cornered them to social ostracizing, unemployment, unavailability to access daily amenities of life like education, food and homes, burning of houses while they were inside, abduction of passports, threat of life when they would call themselves Ahmadi Muslims, loss of families and a fate worse than death itself. Some who had the resources are fleeing Pakistan but, everyone is not in a position to abandon their ancestral homes and uproot their life to start a new one. The government of Pakistan has already broken the diplomatic immunity whereby they were to safeguard the interests of the religious minority and a United Nations intervention on matters of the Ahmadis in Pakistan is now the only hope at such catastrophic times of terror and chaos.At the grassroot level, none of the government leaders have spoken in favour of the Ahmadis since the passing of the constitutional amendment and this image of imposter has now become more like an identification label for anyone who identifies themselves as Ahmadi Muslim in Pakistan.SUGGESTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONSAt times of grave Human Rights violation, the United Nations intervention might only subdue the debate of theocratic nature but might not be able to combat the crux of the issues. There are a total of 73 sects of Muslims in the world, wherein the Sunnis and Shias are the vast majority and across the globe there are only 10 million Ahmadis alive. This debate needs to be discussed and the only way to justify this war on faith is to call all the caliphs into one forum and have a rational discussion regarding the same. Much like the Nuremberg trials held after the World War II to right the wrongs that held Germany responsible, we owe it to the Muslim community as a whole, to ratify this debate once and for all. Otherwise, the Ahmadis much like the Jews will face a fate worse than those of the second world war and terrorism shall prevail the world.CONCLUSIONOne cannot quench his/her thirst without water and water cannot be obtained without a container to hold it. The container is the ‘acceptance of the Muslim community’ as a whole and the faith is water. Without rights of a life with dignity the Ahmadis shall be extinct one day. One can only hope that they get to quench their thirst while there is water in the world. "

    "data": "This work has been written by Kavya Kumar and curated by Rajrishi Ramaswamy, Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad Arnab Manoranjan Goswami v. The State of Maharashtra & Ors., 2020 SCC OnLine SC 931Facts: The appellant, a right-wing journalist and also the Managing Director of ARG Outlier Media Asianet News Private Limited was arrested on an FIR[1] for a case of abetment to suicide of Anvay Naik to whom the appellant (and two others) owed money. The appellant previously filed a petition before the Bombay High Court invoking the writ of Habeas Corpus, asking for quashing of FIR and also pleaded the Court to exercise the extra-judiciary and inherent powers vested in it under Article 226 of the Constitution and Section 482 of the CrPC and grant bail. The HC saw this plea as unnecessary and allowed the appellant to file for regular bail under Section 439 of the CrPC. Aggrieved by the denial of his interim prayer for the grant of bail, the appeal was brought before the Supreme Court.Issues: The issues addressed were firstly whether the allegations of abetment to suicide as stated in the FIR stand prima facie within the tenets of Section 306 read along with section 34 of the IPC and secondly, whether the Bombay HC was right in denying bail under Article 226 and Section 482 of the CrPC.Submissions by the Counsels: The appellant’s counsel submitted that there existed malice in the arrest of his client since he broadcasted criticisms about the Maharashtra government and police. It was also stated by the counsel that the recorded FIR does not fulfil the necessities for the crime as stated under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC. For the offence of abetment to exist there must firstly be incitement to commit the crime either directly or indirectly. Secondly, the accused must have an active role in instigating or facilitating the commission of the crime and thirdly, there must be a proximate relationship in time. These essentials, the counsel stated, were not fulfilled in the present case.The responding counsel, submitted that the High Court was correct in concluding that the facts of the present case did not shock the court enough to invoke extraordinary jurisdiction under Article 226 for direct release. The counsel reiterated the High Court’s decision regarding the crime of abetment to suicide as under Section 306 read with Section 34 of the IPC as valid.Judges: The judgement was given by a division bench comprising of honorable judges, J. Dr. Dhaananjaya Y Chandrachud and J. Indira BanerjeeObservations by the Court: The Court noted that for abetment to suicide, the person so accused must have played an active role by instigating or facilitating the commission of suicide by doing a certain act in that direction. To put it simply, there must be provocation. In the present case, the court held that prima facie it cannot be proven that the appellant abetted the suicide within the meaning of Section 306 of the IPC contemplated with Section 107. There existed no guilty mind or intention of the accused. While the deceased may have been in mental anguish on not receiving payment, there was no direct guilty instigation in proximate time on part of the appellant for the commission of the act which is essential for the crime to fall under the ambit of the aforementioned sections. The HC failed to make this evaluation and disabled itself from granting relief to the appellant under Section 482 of the CrPC and also failed to exercise its jurisdiction under Article 226. The Court also stated that these provisions are not a substitute to the remedy of bail as under Section 439 of the CrPC but simply, a recourse that the Courts ought to judicially implement in case rights of an individual are violated.The Supreme Court emphasized on the role of all Courts in ensuring human liberty. The duty of the Court is to meet the ends of justice while ensuring the process of justice is not abused. The Courts must balance both ends of the spectrum. In the present case the Court believed that appellant was indeed a victim of mala fides and his writ of liberty was at stake and it is the duty of the Court to ensure that Criminal Law does not become a tool of targeted harassment. The court stated that “Liberty survives by the vigilance of her citizens” and the Courts while exercising caution and ensuring no interference takes place in the process of investigation must also safeguard and protect liberty with the inherent powers vested in it.Judgement by the Court: The court held that the rejection of interim bail by the high court was erroneous and directed the release of the appellant (and co-accused) on interim bail subject to a personal bond of Rs.50,000. The bail would continue to remain in operation till the disposal of the proceedings before the High Court.Comments: The appellant is a prominently known right wing journalist therefore it is undeniable that the case has a deeper political influence than what can be gauged at the surface. The Secretary General of the Supreme Court Registry listed the case for an urgent hearing while litigants with similar or more pressing cases were kept waiting. Supreme Court Bar Association President, Dushyant Dave brought up this contention in a letter to the Supreme Court and asked whether the Chief Justice of India had given specific orders for such an extraordinarily speedy hearing. Mr. Goswami’s appeal in the Supreme Court took place immediately, only two days after the rejection of interim bail by the Bombay HC. [1] FIR 59 of 2018 "

    "data": "This article is written by Ipsita Rout, 4th Year, KIIT School of Law, KIIT University and curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.INTRODUCTIONXinjiang has significant numbers of Uighurs, Kazakhs and other predominantly Muslim tribes in the far north-western region of China. It is more analogous to Central Asia, geographically, linguistically and religiously, than the interior of China. In the middle of the region, the landscape is dominated by the vast Taklamakan Desert, numerous mountain ranges and typical oasis towns in the south. The region is rich in natural resources and has some of the highest reserves of oil in China.Since it took over power in 1949, the Communist Party has controlled the area with a strong fist. Xinjiang is considered by many Uighurs as East Turkestan, a name shared between two short-lived independent republics which existed prior to the Communist revolution.Chinese dominance of the area, which has seen an influx of ethnic Chinese refugees and a rise in controls on local language, culture and religion, has long been bridled by the Uighurs. Due to systematic ethnic discrimination, minority groups in Xinjiang complain they are not offered jobs or contracts.BACKGROUNDAuthorities have held 1 million or more people in Xinjiang detention camps, the most extensive mass incarceration program in the world since the Mao period. A wide variety of activities can lead to arrest, including acts of religious devotion, travel to some countries, breaches of birth laws, or the implementation of encrypted messaging applications for mobile phones. Authorities rejected the mass detentions at first. Then, by offering citizens work skills and Chinese language instruction, they acknowledged what they considered a vocational training initiative designed to curb insurgency, separatism and religious extremism. A rigorous prison atmosphere fraught with monotonous political indoctrination and, for many, terrorizing brutality and physical harassment by guards is characterized by those who were held in camps.In 2019, the Chinese government said they had unwound the scheme and released most of those detained, a statement that researchers and advocacy groups received with broad suspicion. Although there were indications that some camps were closed and some of those detained were released, China has also continued to grow the region’s detention centres, especially high-security prisons. According to official figures released in 2019, the country has also undergone a historic surge in convictions, prosecutions and jail terms. Moreover, the Xinjiang job projects have been promoted by the government, including the relocation of workers within the city and to other areas of China, which analysts believe most likely entails repression and forced labour.WHAT IS THE BIG DATA PROGRAM ABOUT?Human Rights Watch (HRW) wrote in a study describing an extensive survey project that indigenous Uighurs in China’s Xinjiang were “arbitrarily” picked for arrest by a software program that flagged suspicious conduct. HRW (Human Rights Watch) said leaked police statistics, which reported more than 2,000 Aksu prefecture detainees, provided further confirmation of “how China’s brutal repression of Xinjiang’s Turkic Islamists is being turbocharged by tech.”The list contains detainees identified by the Integrated Joint Operations Platform (IJOP) of a Chinese predictive analytic program, which gathers data and recognizes detention targets. It includes the names of the Xinjiang Uighurs, telephone numbers and explanations for detention in the so-called re-education camps system in China, including learning the Holy Quran, wearing religious attire or foreign travel. The Aksu list is the first time that we’ve seen the IJOP in action to detain people,” commented Human Rights Watch Maya Wang.WHAT ARE OTHER COUNTRIES STATEMENTS ABOUT THE ACTIONS OF THE CHINESE GOVERNMENT?In Xinjiang, the global reaction to repression has been relatively subdued, an indicator of China’s global impact. The U.S. has placed restrictions on economic activities, trade authorities and government agencies working in Xinjiang over the past year. The declaration of genocide is the sharpest statement so far. The same finding was drawn by a Canadian government last year.Pompeo’s declaration could lead to new U.S. sanctions, but those choices will now be in the control of the Biden administration. One test would be whether the Biden government will seek to convince U.S. allies to endorse attempts to urge Beijing over its Xinjiang persecution in a way that the Trump government has not. Antony Blinken, Biden’s candidate for Secretary of State, suggested during his Senate confirmation hearing on Tuesday (19.01.2021) that the United States will try to pressure other nations for funding.“When we are working with, not denigrating, our allies, that’s a source of strength for us in dealing with China,” he said.[1]However, a lot of Western multinationals have established business relations with Chinese companies linked to the Xinjiang crackdown, such as the German corporation Siemens AG. Sweden has announced that it will grant the Uighurs of China refugee status in 2019.Nearly two dozen developed countries named China in a letter to the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights in July to end the mass detention policy.WHAT DOES CHINA’S TAKE ON ALL OF THIS?China said in a statement to ICIJ media partner The Guardian that the camps are an important weapon in its fight against terrorism and do not violate religious freedom. After the steps were taken, no single terrorist attack has happened in the last three years. According to the statement released by the Chinese Embassy Press Office to the United Kingdom, Xinjiang is again turned into a stable, beautiful and peaceful region. The prevention steps had little to do with religious sects being eradicated. In Xinjiang, religious freedom is completely protected.The credibility of the leaked documents was also denied by China, calling them “pure manufacturing and blatant propaganda.” It pointed to an official White Paper in which the Chinese government explains the purpose of the camps as providing assistance and recovery for those engaging in militant or extremist activities.ANALYSIS AND CONCLUSIONAfter scrutinizing all the documents and evidence that are present today against the Chinese government towards the atrocities faced by the Uighur Muslims, one can certainly say that the government is actively suppressing this sect to ascertain political power and agenda. Economic sanctions and losing relations with other international trading countries has not stopped China from detaining these Muslims. And evidence of denial only proves that China has technology to target its prey, without having to disclose the targets. Therefore, this is a global issue, and it needs urgent attention of all the countries and United Nations to engage in private investigation to get to the bottom of this. Otherwise, soon the US claims of genocide of these Muslims will be reality and it will be too tragic a reality to take action upon and resolve. Our thoughts and prayers go out to the millions of Muslims who are still without voice in the dark struggling to survive. "

    "headline": "Status Quo of Italian Immigration LawsSC revives criminal conspiracy charges against Advani and other BJP leaders14-Year-Old Dalit girl ‘Gangraped and burnt alive’.Miscarriage of Criminal Justice System in India",
    "data": "This article has been written by Dakshita Sharma Katare, Sushant University, Gurugram and curated by Shruti Chaudhary, Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.During early October 2020, the Italian government decided to adopt a new immigration decree. It aimed at modifying the previous two security decrees which were brought in by the previous government and issued in the years 2018 and 2019. In the present times, the Constitutional Affairs Committee is trying to bring amendments which have the potential to improvise the rights of migrants and asylum seekers as well as protect them.These amendments aim at sanctioning on-rescue vessels, rejecting the concept of “safe country of origin” and providing an avenue for the protection of those people who have been at a loss of protected status since the past two years.BackgroundDecreto Salvini – Legge 113/2018 or the Salvini Decree Law was brought in 2018 to change the law on Italian Citizenship. It majorly changed the then existing rules on applications for Italian Citizenship by increasing the application fee along with processing and decision-making time and was brought keeping in mind the then proposed Brexit (Britain’s exit from European Union). It made amends in the prevailing law by bringing a provision for revoking the citizenship of a foreigner or stateless person who was convicted by the court for any criminal offence.In 2019, the Italian Government brought yet another Salvini Decree Law namely Asylum and Immigration Law. This law was made to help the government in deporting anyone who would be considered socially dangerous and who did not have a genuine reason to get an asylum application approved. The Salvini Bill was passed in the Parliament in November 2018 and was strongly opposed due to its complexity and subjectivity. It was estimated that this decree could lead to the deportation of around 48000 refugees from Italy which stirred up the human rights organizations globally.The New DecreeDue to heavy opposition to the previous decree laws, a new decree was brought in October 2020 with significant amendments. Let us try and understand each and every provision under the new decree law and see whether really it will prove beneficial or not.To Abolish the Fines on Nongovernmental Rescue ShipsThe June 2019 decree which got converted into law in October 2019 provided the interior minister the power to deny the permission of entering or staying in Italian waters to any ship under suspicion of violating Italian immigration laws. This also included rescue ships which carry people to a safe port of disembarkation, in compliance with international law. In addition to this, a provision to impose a fine of €150,000 (US$177,500) to €1 million ($1,183,275) on shipmasters of the violating vessels along with their immediate seizure on the grounds of entering Italian waters without authorization was added.The 2020 decree retains the Interior Minister’s authority but reduces the fines to a maximum of €50,000 ($59,000). It also provides exemption to the ships that have performed rescue operations on the conditions laid out by the authority. This includes those shipmasters who comply with “the indications of the competent authority for search and rescue at sea.” But such a condition is very subjective in nature and leaves no scope for those rescue ships which aim at saving the human rights of people, like of people of Libya who are at risk of grave human rights abuse.To Repeal the List of Safe Countries of OriginThe concept of “safe country of origin” comes from the 2018 decree wherein the countries of Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, Ukraine, Ghana, Senegal and Cape Verde were awarded fast track procedure on Asylum applications. According to Italian government, these countries were not in need of international protection. This led to discrimination on the grounds of country of origin. Hence, it was decided to repeal this provision in the 2020 decree.To Restore the Access to Complementary Protection‘Complementary protection’ refers to the grounds for protection that go beyond the definition in the 1951 Refugee Convention. The Italian Law with its 2020 decree aims at reinstating the “special protection.” This means that now residency permits will be again available in Italy on humanitarian grounds. Earlier, the provision of complementary protection provided those people to stay in Italy who had experienced hardships in their native countries or who faced troubles during their migration journeys or the ones who feared returning to their native grounds due to expected risk of life.Though this measure has been reintroduced, it is not retroactive in nature. This is because it will be available to only those individuals whose asylum applications have been pending for some time now.Experts want the government to create a system which allows those people with special protection whose humanitarian permit expired from October 2018 to October 2020, when the amended decrees were being applied in the country. This is because these people were neither able to renew their permits nor convert them. Also, experts wish for the inclusion of those people in this list whose asylum application was rejected in first place, but may seek permits via special protection.ConclusionThe Italian legal system is flexible in nature. Here the parliament has the right to amend the provisions laid out by the government decree within 60 days of its adoption into law. Many observers expect the government to impose an accelerated procedure (“fiducia”) that precludes further debate before a vote is passed in the parliament.Though the Italian Constitutional Affairs Committee has been putting in a lot of efforts to bring amends to the previous laws, yet they won’t be effective till the time any strict and rigid change is not introduced with proper research. The system will be both effective and efficient only if major changes are brought. The current provisions maintain the status quo of the previous decree laws as they are brought in with slight changes.Till the time no major changes are introduced, the situation of the immigrants would not be able to improve in Italy and their human rights will not be safe. Hence, a well laid-out plan is required for their best interest which is objective in nature and well-defined.“To bring a change, we need a change.” "

    "headline": "Online Sexual Violence Won’t Go UnpunishedKnow Who are the New Judges of Supreme Court…RESTRICTION OF INTERNET SERVICES IN J&K: IS IT JUSTIFIED?SUICIDE OR HONOR KILLING?",
    "data": "South Korea setting an example to the WorldPreface:In the initial months of 2020, South Korea came down heavily on the digital sex crimes. New penal guidelines were launched increasing imprisonment for production and distribution of sexually exploiting materials upto 5 years. The event prompting the above step was a college going student Cho Joo Bin, the mastermind involved in the digital sex abuse through a social media platform “Telegram”. The incident rolled media eyes when Cho was sentenced to a 40 year imprisonment for being guilty of targeting almost upto 74 women and putting them to virtual enslavement on social media.The disturbing case involves the alleged coercion and blackmailing of at least 58 women and 16 girls, starting from late 2018. Other 18 additional perpetrators were also arrested over a hundred other chat room participants.As per the news reports, 260,000 participants, including overlapping members in different chat rooms, paid up to US$1,200 for access, by demonstrating themselves as anti-feminist. The chat room operator obtained explicit sexual and sometimes violent footage of victims, such as nude photos, by luring women and girls under false pretenses, including offering employment. He further gathered their names and contact details, and subsequently used the images to blackmail them into producing increasingly cruel and dehumanizing footage.This case is commonly referred to as Telegram Nth Room, and sparked widespread public outrage. Millions of Koreans signed petitions calling for police to reveal the identities of the chat room operator and all other participants. Ground for Action:A 23 year old student Cho Joo Bin was arrested during an operation styling himself as a mid 40 year businessman in a group chat room called “Guru’s Room” on Telegram app. He allegedly used to blackmail the victims by sending them their degrading and violent sexual images. He was also accused of distributing and streaming sexually violent videos to a group chat room called Baksagang where he was commonly known as ‘Baksa’ meaning Doctor in Korean language.The Seoul Central District Court found Cho guilty of violating minor protection laws and making a profit from production and distribution of sexually abusive videos. The Court commented the sentence to be appropriate following the gravity of his offences. Cho was arrested in March and his arrest was followed by a widespread anger and protests of people in South Korea demanding strict penalties as they are already combatting the infestation of online sexual violence. Ultimately, on November 26, one of those terrifying chapters was ended by the pronouncement. Abstract:Prior to this instance in South Korea, generally, the offenders used to get away with nominal fines. This sentence brings a light of hope to victims battling sexual abuse as well as activists demanding stricter penal provisions for offendors and serves as a lesson that the legal system will now take such crimes seriously and the example will improve the aftermath of digital sexual violences.South Korea has been suffering from deep rooted gender inequality for a long time, and the same is evident from the world ranker gap in economic participation and opportunities for women. Adding more to it, the percentage of women in leadership roles is so minimal, that it stands amongst the worst in the world. According to the victims, the discriminative standards of the society are majorly responsible for such offences and an intense societal change can only put an end to gender based online sexual violences. Inference:The Ministry of Justice of South Korea has apologized for its ancient “lukewarm response” to digital sex crimes and has promised stricter efforts. The commissioner general of police committed a thorough investigation of the Telegram Nth Room case, creating two new bodies, the first dedicated to cooperating with overseas law enforcement authorities and technology companies, and the second a prosecution-led task force that incorporates expertise in child and youth crimes and recovering illegally obtained gains from criminals. The vital requirement for putting an end to such miserable and disgusting crimes is to get to the radicles of widespread presence of such offences and extend a high quality medical and psychological support to the survivors to normalise their lives and create a better ambience for them by reforming criminal laws to protect women from violence and protect their right to privacy while also protecting freedom of expression. Police, prosecutors, and judges need to ensure that survivors’ rights are at the forefront of all justice responses. Also the authorities must restrict every access to such traumatizing and dehumanizing materials available online. It’s about time to exhibit a clear message, “ ONE’S BODY CANNOT BE THE MEANS OF PLEASURE FOR ANOTHER AT ANY COST”. "

    "headline": "The Phantom of New Rape Laws in Pakistan  Can Strict Penalty Stop Rapes?WHETHER SUPREME COURT CAN INTERFERE IN THE PERSONAL LAWS?Money Laundering SC sets record by recommending 51 names for High Court Judges: Read to Know More",
    "data": "This article has been written by Vijeta Mahara and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law. Introduction:The article is footed on the approval of a new rape law in Pakistan on Tuesday, Dec. 29, 2020 that allows speedy trials and chemical castration of serial offenders.The law also tends to create specialised courts exclusively designed to deal with the matters of rape and sexual abuses.However, it yet needs to be ratified by the parliament of Pakistan in 120 days.The President Arif Alvi has approved the new anti-rape law and stated that it will help to expediate the cases of such offences against women and children and will encourage the victims to come forward against recognizing the offenders. Background:The Prime Minister Imran Khan has proposed the new legislation following the brutal rape incident in Sept. 2020, when a resident of France, was gang raped in front of her children in Lahore, beside a deserted motorway, which led to the wildfire protests in the city, later turning into a public roar due to the comment of a lead police investigator that the victim should not have travelled alone at night. Highlights of the Ordinance:Establishment of special courts to try cases of rape and sexual abuse against women and children.Deadline of four months to conclude the trail.Any officer negligent in the investigation of such offences could be punishable with 3 years in Prison.National sex offenders registry.Establishment of anti-rape units conducting medical examination of victim within 6 hours of complaint.Death Penalty and chemical castration of repeat offenders and of those convicted in most brutal cases. Chronicle of Rape Laws in Pakistan:In the year 1979, Pakistan legislature made adultry and rape punishable offences under The offence of Zina with the punishments of fine, imprisonment and even stoning to death; however, it reinforced that there must be a concrete evidence for the same, being a witness who can testify or the rape deemed credible by Quazi.In 2006, The Women Protection Bill was passed, which made consensual sex after marriage an offence punishable with imprisonment of 5 years and rape punishable with either death or imprisonment of 10-25 years and gangrape with death penalty or life imprisonment.Then came the Criminal Law (Amendment) of 2016, the DNA test was now made compulsory for rape cases and sabotaging the work of police brought imprisonment of 1 year, it also had provisions for legal and medical aid for rape survivors, in-camera proceedings, privacy of victim’s identity, conclusion of trials under 3 months and if not concluded as such, want of direct directions from the High Court Chief Justice. Rape Incidents in Pakistan:Rape cases in Pakistan are mostly Institutionalized and implicit the plain approval of the state. In the year 2002, Mukhtaran Bibi, a 28 year old lady was ordered to be gang raped by the village council as her brother was alleged to have sexual relations with a girl from higher caste. In 2005, a woman was raped by the police officers as she didn’t bribe them to release her husband from prison. Shazia Khalid,who now stays in Canada and therefore, talks openly about these situations in Pakistan was raped during the presidency of Parvez Musharraf. In Multan, the panchayat ordered rape of a 16 year old girl in lieu of her brother’s conduct. A 13 year old Kainat was kidnapped and raped for 4 days and reporting the offence led to the murder of her brother, death sentence of elder members of the family and continuous threats from the rapists. In the Dera Gazi Khan area, Border Police Officers reportedly carried 5 girls forcefully from a picnic and raped them. A girl who married against the wishes of her family was raped by the dominant members of the Village Panchayat. And this torment is not only confined to females, even the boys are not safe. A 13 year old boy was intoxicated and sexually assaulted, the same day in Faisalabad, a 15 year boy was found dead and sexual assault was confirmed by the medical report. This is not enough, adding more to it, there is a culture called Bacha Bazi, justified as a cultural tradition in north west Pakistan which involves the sexual abuse of adolscent boys by older men. And the most recent incident that set the nation on fire was the brutal gang rape of a woman in front of her children. Critical Analysis:In a country where reporting of a sexual offence leads to the death of the victim’s family members, and a constant threat to the life and security of the victim,there can be enormous serious consequences of harsh penalties. Moreover, the chronicles exhibit that about 70% of the rapes and sexual abuses are either done in police custodies, by the police officials and administrative officials or directly or indirectly sponsored by the state, hence, it would be better to amend a flawed system then to just keep building strident laws.Since, it is an imminent fact that the laws are created for the betterment of the society and the penal implications must reflect a positive evolution, what can be the benefit of such a law that can divulge a negative impact on the aggrieved and the society as a whole. Any tough stance without modifying the distorted structures of legal and administrative system can even lead to the assassination of the victim in order to rub out the evidences. Secondly, any law in the direction of affecting criminals only is of no help to victims, as we all know that the death penalty for murder and even rarest of the rare rape cases, has not been able to put a stop on the occurrence of such crimes. Conclusion:The development of rape laws and retribution should be backed up with data and case studies. The legislation of any country must make laws to strengthen women in a sense that the crimes related to rape and sexual abuse are not treated distictly from other crimes, as presently all of this directly or indirectly affects a woman only. A penalty should be there but in a way that it no more sabotages the ‘Dignity’ of a woman. "

    "headline": "TURKEY PASSES A NEW LAW ON OVERSIGHT OF ASSOCIATIONS- AN INFORMATIVE INSIGHTCAN DCP BE HELD LIABLE FOR POST POLL VIOLENCERight to Information: Evolution and Recent SetbacksCORONA: ATTACKED HUMANISM AND RAISED AN AMENDMENT TO PROTECT HUMANISM",
    "data": "This article has been written by Ipsita Rout, 4th Year, KIIT SCHOOL OF LAW, KIIT UNIVERSITY and Curated by Nandita Mishra, Chanakya National Law University, Patna1. INTRODUCTIONA bill that would improve the monitoring of civil society organisations was passed by the Turkish parliament. The act is called ‘Preventing the Financing of the Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction’ and was formulated by the ruling Justice and Development Party of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan to comply with the guidelines of the United Nations Security Council to keep terrorist financing and money laundering in check. Critics consider that certain provisions of the bill are unconstitutional and believe that, because they conflict with the right to freedom of association, they violate the provisions of the Turkish constitution.WHAT DOES THE BILL SAY ABOUT THIS?The Bill follows the 2019 Turkey review prepared by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) of the Intergovernmental Authority to tackle money laundering and terrorist financing. The bill contains 43 articles and has made revisions to seven laws on the Law of Associations of Turkey and is intended to protect Turkey from being blacklisted by the Paris-based terror funding watchdog. The FATF is now in its 30th year as an intergovernmental body working to “set standards and promote the effective enforcement of legal, regulatory and functional steps to fight money laundering, the financing of terrorism and other possible dangers to the integrity of the global financial system.”WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PASSAGE OF THE BILL?The Bill gives the Turkish state the authority to nominate non-governmental organizations (NGOs) as trustees, suspend their operations, seize their properties and monitor their funding sources. According to numerous media reports, in a nation where civil society is still not very open, critics and human rights advocates see this change as a way of crackdown on dissenters.Thousands of reporters, policymakers, scholars and judges have been targeted by the government after a failed coup in 2016 aimed at defending democracy in the country. Earlier this year, as part of its measures against those suspected of being involved in a 2016 coup plot to destabilize Erdogan’s government, Turkish prosecutors ordered the detention of nearly 700, including military and justice ministry personnel. Erdogan, who is viewed as an Islamist and a nationalist, has been in power for more than a decade now, bringing about a series of changes in Turkish society.The Turkish authorities have carried out a crackdown on the suspected followers of the US-based Muslim cleric Fethullah Gülen, whom Erdogan has long accused of planning the 2016 coup, after the coup took place. Gülen refuted those accusations and denounced the coup. In reality, he has previously indicated that the government itself “staged” the coup. An article in Al-Monitor said the bill would give another blow to “civil society, which is taking precautions to steer Turkey on a more democratic path and have radiated hope even as Erdogan is moving the country in the opposite direction.”There is a lack of independence in the Turkish courts, and there is a ubiquitous trend of courts convicting people of terrorist offences on the basis of their legal actions and without presenting proof of material connections to armed groups. For this purpose, Human Rights Watch strongly opposes equipping the Ministry of the Interior with the ability to use the pretext of an investigation into terrorism that has not been tried, let alone convicted, to bar individuals from communicating with NGOs.Even though, in order to become permanent, administrative decisions to temporarily suspend group activities need to be validated by court order, the judiciary lacks freedom and the executive can, on a whim, intervene with the administration of justice. For these purposes, in order to protect non-governmental organisations from arbitrary termination, the courts may not be successful.CONCLUSIONThe bar associations’ civil rights advocacy is likely to be significantly weakened. Whenever a critical bar association discloses a violation of human rights or criticizes the human rights policies of the government, another bar association is likely to issue a counter-statement, undermining the value of the criticism and politicising the matter. In short, while the formation of competing bar associations in cities can seem to give lawyers a wider choice over which professional body to join at face value, the state’s own comments about the initiative and the timing and means by which it is being enforced reveal a political goal unrelated to legitimate attempts to advance or enhance legal profession standards. The proposed legislation is politically divisive, would bring an end to the proportionate representation of bars in the Union of Turkish Bars at national level, and will lead to weakening the appearance of impartiality and independence in the system of justice.Turkey’s new law in essence is a stab to the freedom of associations and has brought a newer threat to the emotional attachment in the minds of the aggrieved citizens, as it curtails their freedom of movement, and also narrows the choice that they had before, all leading to curtailment of rights as a whole.

    "data": "The article is written by Nancy Chaturvedi of Jagran Lakecity University, and curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.LGBTQ unmarried, dating couples demanded for same protection from domestic violence as provided to those people who are in heterosexual relationship in North Carolina. According to a report of American Civil Liberties Union the state is hindmost in the whole country to restrict the same-sex couples into some secure legal immunity in defence of domestic violence.In the case of M.V v. T.J the court ruled that according to the North Caroline law at issue Chapter 50B of North Carolina General Statues only heterosexual couples can claim protection against domestic violence. The law defines the “personal relationship “as heterosexual relationship. In opinion of the state Chapter 50 B held no legitimate, important, or substantial government interest in denying equal protection against domestic violence to same-sex couples. The court ruled that the fundamental rights to personal liberty and safety and in addition to it the Equal Protection clause of 14th amendment is violated. Chief Justice Linda McGee addressing the majority wrote, “Instead, by denying Plaintiff and similarly situated people the protections it provides victims of domestic violence in ‘opposite-sex’ dating relationships, runs directly counter to the promotion of the public good, welfare, morals, safety, and any other legitimate public interests of the State”.The case began in 2018 when a North Carolina woman filed for a domestic violence protection appeal from a woman whom she was dating and the relationship just ended .M.E’s former partner did not respond to her decision and replied in a manner according to her testimony wherein she filed protection order under 50B, in her protection she wanted her partner to surrender the gun of which her former partner had possession of from her (partner) parents gun collection. A trial Judge refused her appeal stating that 50 B only allows protection to same-sex couples. The judge suggested that she could seek a civil no contract order under Chapter 50 C but that does not restrict the defendant to surrender arms or restrict him from buying new ones. Irena Coma senior staff attorney for the ACLU of the North Carolina representing M.E pointed out that people in same-sex relationship are considered downgrade due to their LGBTQ status.The plaintiff M.E stated that this sort of discrimination should not have been present in the first place and now that it is considered she is happy with the decision of court. She also said that she is hopeful that the ruling will help out those people who are in tough situation.The landmark case of Bostock v. Clayton County, Georgia which granted protection from employment discrimination to LGBTQ under Civil Rights Act was cited by the North Carolina Court of Appeal. Referring to Justice Neil Grouch’s analysis the court established that discrimination based on LGBTQ status is discrimination on ‘sex’ or ‘gender’. Coma in one of its argument stated that it is a pure discrimination based on sex had it been M.E dating a man, M.E would not have subjected to such discrimination.Furthermore when the Chapter 50 B was extended to same sex couples also the question that arose was whether statues that protect women specifically from men still hold or not. The most pertinent case of prejudice was House Bill 2 in 2016 that made it unlawful for cities to permit those who had not surgically or legitimately changed the gender on their birth certificate to use the public bathroom for the gender that they identify. Addition to this a crucial loss for the LGBTQ+ community in North Carolina, it was a deprivation for North Carolina as it contradicted protection to an endangered group of citizens. Meanwhile, “House Bill 2” was revoked in 2017, some anti-discrimination ordinances still remain in place in North Carolina, which means that this prejudice may still be a part of North Carolina’s future.North Carolina may be the last state to extend equal protection to same-sex relationships but it has each and every possibility to substitute that with a judgement from the Court of Appeals disprove the application of 50B to M.E. and broadened the right to a Chapter 50B protective order to parties in same-sex dating relationships in North Carolina. With this M.E covered an important spadework in the field of sexual discrimination and gender specification under state law. "

    "headline": "The Breaking of Shackles of Kafala Workers in QatarRam Mandir vs Babri Masjid: Probable SolutionsAN INTRODUCTION TO FIRSUICIDE OR HONOR KILLING?",
    "data": "This article has been written by Dakshita Sharma Katare from Sushant University, Gurugram and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law.On Sept. 8, 2020 the Qatar Government introduced significant reforms in the Kafala system prevalent in the country, keeping in view the three-year co-operation program with International Labour Organisation (ILO). This program aimed at improving the lives of the labour class, i.e., domestic workers, migrant workers (including those employed under the Kafala System), etc. in the country. Two major reforms have been brought in to protect the human rights of the Kafala workers. But these reforms can’t be understood, till the time one doesn’t have the knowledge about what exactly the Kafala system is?The Kafala system, which commenced around the sixth decade of the twentieth century, is a form of sponsorship system common in the middle- east countries of the world. This system started at the time when oil was discovered in these countries and there was a requirement for a temporary and rotating labour class which could be easily brought into the country and sent out according to the economic conditions. In this system, workers are often migrants, whose immigration status is legally bound to an employer for a specified period of time, which means that the worker has no liberty to travel outside a country or enter a country without the permission of the ‘kafeel’, his employer. In addition to this, he does not even have the right to transfer his employment, i.e., to seize working under one employer and start working under another employer without the written assent from his kafeel. All the travel expenses of the worker are sponsored by his employer and he is strictly bound to him throughout his stay in the country. All of this increases the power of the sponsor manifolds and he soon starts exploiting his employee and his liberty.All these restrictions infringe the right to life and personal liberty, right to free movement and right to freedom of occupation of the Kafala workers along with hindering their human rights. The violation of human rights of these workers has called for the reforms in the laws associated with it. Many international organisations have come forward in the past few years to uplift the rights of the Kafala workers and Bahrain, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia have introduced major reforms with respect to this issue and Jordan, Istanbul, Oman and United Arab Emirates too have put in efforts to improve the conditions of the migrant workers. Qatar is the latest addition to this list.The two reforms brought in by the Qatari Government are- firstly, the abolition of NOC (No Objection Certificate), which was earlier to be issued by the kafeel (to grant permission) in case the worker wished to change his job; and secondly, the stipulation of 1000 Qatari riyal as the monthly minimum wage of the employee. Under the first amelioration, the workers will now be able to leave the job by giving a one-month prior notice if they have been an employee for less than two years and by a two-month notice, in case they have been working under the same kafeel for more than this time. The second reform provides for the monthly minimum wage as 1000 Qatari riyal (20,230 Indian rupees), in addition to allowances worth 300 QAR (6,069 INR) for food and 500 QAR (10,115 INR) for accommodation, in case the institution/ company doesn’t provide for them. Unlike the previous reform measures, this minimum wage has been institutionalised for everyone, including the domestic workers too.These measures can be considered a milestone in the field of labour laws as these proposed changes not only aim at providing the human rights to the workers, but also make Qatar the first country in the Gulf region to allow all migrant workers to change jobs before the end of their contracts without first obtaining their employer’s consent and the second country in this region after Kuwait, for setting the minimum wages for the workers.Yet these reforms are not entirely perfect as they still allow the employers to file a criminal case of absconding on the workers who leave their jobs without seeking permission from the former and the minimum wage fixed by the government is not that progressive, though it does increase the standard for the poorly paid classes.The effectiveness of these reforms is entirely based on the efficiency of the authorities in carrying out their responsibilities and promptly taking steps for the betterment of the migrant workers. Time to time upgradation of the minimum wages set for the workers and consistent application along with strict administration are the only keys for the success of the goals set by the Qatar Government.“One can never achieve success by planning alone, one has to strive hard for it.Only then is fulfilment of goals is possible and only then can one taste success.”"

    "data": "INDIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE VS. NEPTUNE OVERSEAS LTD. AND ORS.(Civil Appeal no.9037 of 2019 and Civil Appeal no.629 of 2020)BENCH: JUSTICE SANJAY KISHAN KAUL & JUSTICE HRISHIKESH ROYAppellant: Indian Commodity Exchange Ltd.[the successor of National Multi Commodity Exchange], hereinafter referred as ICELRespondent no.1: Neptune Overseas Ltd. ,hereinafter referred as NOL, [A company registered under Companies Act for import ,export and trading in various commodities including rubber]Respondent no.2 : Mr.Kailash Ramkishan Gupta [ The CEO of National Multi Commodity Exchange and the Managing Director of NOL]Provisions Involved: Sections 3,4 and 8 of Forward Contracts Act hereinafter referred to as The FC Act which under Section 3 provides for the establishment of Forward Market Commission hereinafter referred to as FMC , an authority regulating commodities future market.Section 4 of the Act states that the function of FMC and Section 8 grants power to the Central Govt. to return or direct inquiry.Issue: Whether the Principles of Natural Justice were violated in the proceedings transpired against the Respondents.Facts : An independent journalist on 28.11.10 reported irregularities in trading and abuse of positions by the Respondents to FMC.The FMC thus initiated an inquiry into the affairs of NMCE exercising the powers under Section 8(2) and 8(4) of the FC Act and a detailed show cause notice was served under section 4(b) of the said Act which empowers FMC to keep forward markets under observation and take action if necessary. This notice was addressed to Respondent no.2 in his capacity as Vice Chairman of NMCE and Chairman and Managing Director of Respondent No.1, NOL giving him a period of 10 days from the date of receipt of notice to respond. A personal hearing was fixed and liberty was granted to Respondent No.2 to peruse any documents within a period of 7 days from the date of receipt of notice, if he so desired.However, Respondent no.2 kept on asking for adjournments, questioning jurisdiction of FMC and parallel proceedings were initiated by Respondent No.1 herein by filing Special Civil Application before the Gujarat High Court. These proceedings sought to challenge the show cause notice and, inter alia, raised the issue that FMC had no jurisdiction, power or authority to commence or continue any enquiry or issue any directions. The issuance of notice to Respondent no.1 was thus construed through Respondent no.2 by the learned Single Judge.It was thus opined that proper opportunity was given to Respondent no.1 however FMC has not taken final view till now therefore it was premature for Respondent no.1 to approach the HC.On the date of the said order, Respondent no.2 filed grievance for documents not supplied and sought adjournment which was declined by the FMC after which Respondent no.1 filed an LPA through Respondent no.2 who now filed an impleadment to plead himself in personal capacity and challenged the order of FMC which prohibited the respondents from continuing trading activities.The order was quashed by the Division Bench of Gujarat High Court weighing on the Principles of Natural Justice without getting into the merits of the case and opined to supply documents to respondents on payment of usual charges.The successor entity of FMC, SEBI challenged the order in the Supreme Court and the operation of order of Division Bench was stayed however, 30 days time was granted to respondents to appeal to Securities Appellate Tribunal.The appeal was filed by the respondents where SAT passed an order that there was a lack of opportunity to the respondents as the request for provision of documents was denied by the FMC. Also the lack of jurisdiction to issue the show cause notice was re-agitated and SEBI was directed to grant adequate time to respondents and also consider the jurisdiction issue in accordance with law.Aggrieved by the order, an appeal was raised before Supreme Court by Indian Commodity Exchange Ltd. and SEBI( the successor of FMC) under two different Civil Appeals.Arguments:Appellant :Mr. Dushyant Dave Senior Counsel for ICEL sought that the two respondents are playing games as they are in real one and the same entity, therefore the corporate veil must be pierced through to see what really is the endeavour of the respondents.He also urged that the principles of natural justice be simply fitted in a straight jacket formula,it has to be seen in a holistic view and that adequate opportunities be provided to both the respondents .He also contended that ICEL, who is the successor of NMCE is itself standing for appeal and the earlier communications show that both have been treated as one by the entities themselves and therefore the validity of the order must be decided on the touchstone of prejudice.Another learned Senior Counsel Mr. C.U.Singh supported the plea of ICEL and laid emphasis on the fact that the order of Gujarat High Court which was solely predicated on the denial of opportunity of hearing which was already set aside by the Hon’ble Supreme Court.Respondent: Learned Counsel Rishabh Parikh contended that since there was no question of law, the appeal is not maintainable and that the appellants have no locus to file the appeal.He further contended that there has been no show cause notice served on Respondent 1 and FMC has conceded this fact.That the common thread of arguments is the violation of Principles of Natural Justice as without even any notice served, the shares of the Respondent were cancelled and the holding of shares was also prohibited by the order of FMC.That a notice of 150 pages was served without any documentation which was denied and on frequent askings a documentation of 4000 pages was provided with a time period of only 14 days denying further adjournments within which the matter was closed as well.Judgment: The Supreme Court after hearing both sets of arguments observed that there is no doubt that the notice was served on the Respondents. However, the court fails to appreciate why there should have been a cussedness in handing over mere copies of documents when serious allegations and serious consequences are put to the respondents and also the endeavour to conclude the proceedings within a span of two weeks thereafter cannot, in our view, be said to be an adequate opportunity as has been found by the SAT.The Supreme Court therefore disposed of the appeal with the modification of the impugned order leaving the parties to bear their own costs along with the following directions:No fresh show cause notice to be issued. The one already served is to be treated as served to both the Respondents.The documents not supplied to the Respondents must be supplied, for clarity. Respondents must seek the required documents within two weeks and within another two weeks they must be supplied by the authorities and the respondents must file a reply within 4 weeks of supply of documents.SEBI would proceed with the personal hearing of Respondents on a day to day basis and no adjournments shall be entertained and that SEBI would take the final view on the matter.In case the Respondents are aggrieved the remedy still lies with SAT.Pleas raised by the Respondents shall be considered on the basis of legal and actual findings including jurisdiction and not only confined to jurisdiction.In case the Respondents fail in their endeavour, no new proceedings will begin and can continue from where they are.The impugned order of FMC is set aside and a fresh order is to be passed, the proceedings shall be kept in abeyance of this order until a final view is taken by SEBI. Conclusion: The facts and judgment of the above case clearly manifest that any action in Violation of Principles of Natural Justice from the authorities is bound to be struck down; however, this does not mean that one can hide behind the veil and flee from their respective liabilities and responsibilities. The Judgment upholds the fact that the two Respondents are one and interchangeable entities but on the other hand also held the arbitrary declination of documents and not granting adequate and reasonable time by the Appellants to the respondents Inaccurate. Thus the balance of convenience has been truly and properly justified by the Supreme Court. "

    "data": "This article is written by Ipsita Rout of KIIT, School of Law and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University. ILLUMINATING THE ISSUE AT HAND‘Pushback’ is the term that describes the practice of the authorities prohibiting people from finding safety in their territories by force when they are returning to another state. By holding back those looking for protection Member States abdicate responsibility for questioning the dignity of the border. They have their cases. Pushbacks cover the legal definition of Collective expulsion prohibited by Article 4 of Protocol No 4 to European Convention on the Defense of Human Rights (ECHR). This is a reference to the ‘Prohibition of collective expulsion of aliens’ that occurs when a group is forced to leave the country without being unbiased and honest assessment of particular events.Push Backs are in breach of EU and international law because it undermines people’s right to seek asylum. It refuses people the right to due process until the decision to expel them is made, and it could eventually threaten to send refugees and others in need of international assistance and security back in danger.ARE EU COUNTRIES LEGALLY PERMITTED TO TURN MIGRANTS AND REFUGEES OFF AT SEA?Within the territory of the European Union, no, but beyond those seas, yes. “The moment a person reaches the borders of a European country, the person concerned is qualified to apply for asylum, which must then be investigated,” argues international law scholar Alexander Proelss. But “by principle, there is no such claim beyond the European territory”—not beyond the coastal waters of the state, which can reach up to 12 nautical miles (22.2 km; 13.8 mi) from the coastline. “In the past, there have also been numerous incidents in the Mediterranean in which government vessels were deployed exactly beyond these 12 miles and then forced the refugee boats back so that they could not claim asylum,” says Proelss. He points out that this is a tactic that infringes fundamental human rightsIS THERE AN INTERNATIONAL LEGAL DUTY TO SUPPORT VICTIMS IN DISTRESS?Every captain is obligated assist people in distress, no matter who they are and with what reason the vessel is in distress unless it endangers the captain’s vessel or crew. This is set out in the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 1979 International Marine Search and Rescue Convention.As to what the international maritime law says on what occurs to the rescued, Proelss says: “There is no duty under international law of the sea that a nation into which refugees are entering, such as Italy or Greece, has to acknowledge the fact that they can go offshore there.” The current maritime law is incomplete on this issue. In other words, decades-old principles under the law of the sea refer only to a minimal degree to the current refugee crisis.CAN REFUGEE TAKE LEGAL ACTION TOWARDS PUSHBACKS?It’s really difficult. First of all, the national regulation in effect is that of the State in whose waters a castaway has been found. Each government must ensure that its civil servants comply with the laws in force and, in particular, with binding human rights when it comes to the maritime rescue. If they do not—as in the case of pushbacks in which the Greek coast guard is suspected to have been involved—the victims may take legal action against this unfair treatment before the Greek courts. If the national judicial process has been completed, an appeal can be brought before the European Court of Human Rights. But: “Migrants who have been transported to Turkish waters have other problems and, to prevent misunderstanding, have neither the awareness nor the means to follow the correct procedure,” says legal analyst Matz-Lück. There is presently no other opportunity to take action against pushbacks.HOW IS GREECE APPROACHING THIS LEGAL SITUATION?Greece denies the use of illegal tactics against boat refugees. Amid the COVID outbreak, the country faces “massive and structured migration flows” from Turkey, the Greek Hellenic Coast Guard informed Deutsche Welle in response to requests for comments. The Coast Guard also confirmed that Greece is securing the European maritime borders in compliance with national and international law. To deter immigrants and refugees coming from Turkey, the government in Athens is preparing to set up an underwater barrier just under 3 kilometers away from the Aegean island of Lesbos.CONCLUSIONAt times of grave human rights violation, the United Nations steps to safeguard the citizens. But, the tales of the waters which have seen the impossible, heard the screams in vessels and tolerated the sorrow of the hidden- humanity is the only hope. The atrocities of the European waters and the extent of pushbacks calls in for urgent intervention on the government, for the time has come for a new era, to shapeshift the laws and protect the ones lost at seas, seeking purpose in life.In conclusion, the author would like to condemn the government’s decision to seize small boats at the very time of its introduction by naval vessels, as this often leads to casualties and urges for an international resolution on the methods of the EU. Every individual has some basic human rights and, above all, every refugee has certain rights which guarantee the security of his or her life. It would be imprudent and arbitrary to kill refugees who are trying to cross the English Channel to enter the United Kingdom. Instead of adopting such a vindictive system, the state can conform by refugee law and assist refugees by complying with the rules on maritime laws, family reunion, shielding unaccompanied minors, extending resettlement services and supplying them with humanitarian visas. At best, the European states could allow them to cross their channels or let them seek shelter in the shores, so they could find a life of dignity elsewhere, but the contemporary strategy of the European government is nothing but a state of tragedy promoting a global refugee crisis.

    "headline": "TANZANIA CASE: A REFUGE OR PERIL‘Every Indian Has To Use His Liberties To Constantly Question The Actions Of Those In Power’ By Justice Ravindra Bhat.CRZ Violation: SC orders status quoSub-Ordinate Judiciary affected by Inexperience at Bar",
    "data": "This article has been written by Vijeta and curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National law University. IntroductionThe article finds its roots in the incidents that have recently taken place in Tanzania where Burundian refugees are reportedly alleged to have disappeared and tortured. It is also reported that 18 of these refugees were brutally abused and the whereabouts of several others still remain unspecified. In the last of 2019 and starting of 2020 the Tanzanian Police and Intelligence is said to have forcefully disappear, torture, arbitrarily detain about 11 Burundian refugees and caused involuntary return of others to Burundi where they were arrested without any charge. Since January 2020 refugees and asylum seekers are constantly reported being arrested from Mtendi and Nduta camps near Burundi border. PrefaceTanzania was supposed to be one of the most generous refugee hosting countries of the world at a time, where in total 335000 refugees from different parts of Africa took asylum. However, the 2015 elections in Burundi flashed a widespread insecurity and a new influx of Burundian refugees in Tanzania who now create a majority of refugees in the country. Three decades ago there were one million refugees in Tanzania and after the civil war in 90’s between Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups, hundreds of thousands of more people fled to Tanzania. Most of them eventually returned or received citizenships but some still live in camps and those who do are compelled to have a life of misery and unstopped agony as they have restrictions on movement, they cannot work or trade and also cannot go to school. Tanzania has clearly prompted that it will prioritize returning the refugees to their home countries and the strict encampment policy they have is a part of this. It has already withdrawn from the Comprehensive Refugee Response Framework, an initiative by the UN to find solutions for refugees, which only makes the life of refugees in camps more difficult. Contextual BackgroundAround 1, 63,000 Burundian refugees live in Tanzanian camps due to constant civil agitations and disputes in their country. And the Tanzanian Govt. has been regularly pressurizing them to return. These refugees always live in the fear of arrests, violence, detentions and involuntary deportations as Tanzania has also restricted the interference of the UN Refugee Agency to keep a check on pressurized involuntary returns. On October 11, 2019 when the Tanzanian President stated that Burundian refugees should “GO HOME”, the officials started specifically targeting the parts of Burundian refugee population who were already vulnerable. The stories from the refugees are even more terrifying, they have to deal with insecurities, police abuses and involuntary deportation threats. It is due to these constant threats that they sometimes run away to some other countries like Uganda. Their reason to leave Tanzania includes the fear of getting arrested, disappeared or killed in the refugee camps. The life of refugees in these camps is no more than a dungeon as the Tanzanian government has closed and destroyed the local markets, these refugees are not allowed to earn a living or get education and even the freedom of movement is also restricted. Some refugees cite the lack of basic resources, services and amenities in the camps as well. In short, the refugees are not considered more than some chattel purchased for slaughter.The UN and Tanzania’s stand on Burundian RefugeesThe 1951 Refugee Convention and The 1969 African Refugee Convention prohibit the deportation of refugees if they have a threat to their life and freedom. Keeping a note of it an agreement was made between Tanzania, Burundi and the UN that UNHCR will interview the ones returning to check whether it was voluntary or not and the number was decided to be kept below 2000 refugees per week, however the countries ignoring the guidelines by the UN in August 2019 entered into a separate agreement that stated “All the refugees are to return to the country of their origin whether voluntarily or not”. This agreement clearly violates the international legal prohibition against REFOULEMENT, the forceful return of a refugee leading to torture, persecution and threat to life. The UN states refoulement not only occurs when a refugee is unwillingly deported but creating the scenarios where it is impossible for him to sustain and he is compelled to go back to a place he left for saving his life, is also a form of refoulement which precisely is what is alleged in Tanzania.Status of Tanzanian Laws and Obligations on RefugeesIn Tanzania, the refugee policy distinguishes between “settlements” mainly for housing the 70’s refugees and “camps” for those arriving in the 1990s. Settlements have access to larger plots of land. However, in both cases refugees’ rights to freedom of movement are similarly restricted. In the year1998 Tanzania enacted new legislation, the Refugees Act, which replaced older laws and sought to deal with the country’s obligations pursuant to the signing of the OAU Convention governing specific aspects of Refugees Problems in Africa of 1969 Convention. In addition to seeking conformity with the country’s continental commitments, a secondary objective was set to make Tanzania a less attractive destination for asylum seekers, and sending a deterrent message to authorities in refugee-generating countries. Government policy also encouraged repatriation as the preferred solution. The new legislation intensified restrictions on the rights of refugees in the country and controls on the movement of encamped refugees increased. Although not codified in the 1998 Act, a practice has developed which prohibits refugees from moving outside a four-kilometre radius of their camp.The 1998 Act makes no specific mention of the right of freedom of movement for refugees, however, pursuant to sections 16 and 17, authorities have the power to require any asylum seeker or refugee to reside within a “designated area” (DA) – a euphemism for a refugee camp or settlement. So in all the new enactments and refugee policy completely focuses on returning the refugees to their original country.Descriptive Profile: To perfectly implicate their Refugee Policy, The Tanzanian authorities have reportedly enforced the disappearances of the Burundian refugees. The victims and the camp workers who are fearful to disclose identity reveal that the officials are themselves involved in the process. In case a refugee steps out of DA for any reason, he can be sent to camp jail for 3 days or so. A movement permit can only be issued for up to 14 days unless the Director of Refugee Services has specifically allowed a permit for a longer period of time. If the individual fails to comply with the terms and conditions of their permit, they may be guilty of an offence against the Act, and if convicted, can be imprisoned for up to six months or fined fifty thousand shillings or both Victims state being held captive under false charges of possession of weapons, detained for weeks without food, and done sexual assaults. They are kept in a room without electricity and other basic amenities, some also confess being hanged by handcuffs, pierced by bike spokes and rubbed chilli on face and private parts. The torture is so atrocious that they finally implore to go back to Burundi. The officials have also been proclaimed to demand money from the families of the victims. When they are finally deported the Burundian authorities either arrest them or they somehow flee to some other country. Some of such victims eventually reached out to the UN refugee agency as well.The UNHCR states being deeply concerned about the continuing reports from Tanzania about refugee abuse and therefore has requested the Tanzanian Authorities a full fleshed investigation on the matter and asked to file a written report on the matter to which the later only replies of high level investigation going on but no results received so far. The Tanzanian Foriegn Minister in a speech made a complete denial on “EXPELLING” refugees instead asserted that they merely mobilize to encourage voluntary returns. Nevertheless, the Burundian refugee victims have a different narrative altogether. They mention that most of the disappearances have occurred in the same manner, the Police Officials breach house doors or windows around 3 in the morning pronouncing not to be afraid as its police and then seize men from the houses and whom they take, never return! Alike episodes have taken place in most of the camps and when in the morning the family of the victims inquire about the missing people, the Police denies any patrolling or any of the arrests. One of the victimized females even recognized the police officer of the camp that took her husband and therefore, was threatened with death so she succumbed to silence afterwards. The Burundian refugees in Tanzania thus seem to be surviving under horrific conditions and are constrained to endure the barbaric conduct of the Tanzanian Authorities. ConclusionUnder the International Law, such a situation is termed as ENFORCED DISAPPEARANCES, where the authorities first deprive a person of liberty and then refuse to acknowledge that deprivation. This is a heinous, inhuman and degrading treatment that the Burundians in Tanzania are bound to suffer with The United Nations is their only hope which must now become more vigilant and proactive to deal with these incidents and should try to create a sturdy International pressure on both the Governments to ratify and strictly follow the International Conventions and their guidelines thereby in reference to the refugees. Also a renewed Tanzanian refugee policy must be launched to respect their international rights to exercise freedom of movement and focusing on promoting local integration. Above all the Government and the people of Tanzania have to understand that no one becomes a refugee by choice, he is a HUMAN who has already lost his home, aspirations and dignity. A refugee is not there to snatch the money, places or the opportunities in a country of refuge; he is there because HE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE! He takes refuge in a HOPE that maybe he can at least survive peacefully and this hope should be treated as an obligation by the Country hosting him."

    "data": "This article has been written by Dakshita Sharma Katare and Curated by Nandita Mishra, Chanakya National Law University, Patna COVID-19 has impacted the lives of each and every individual on this earth. Some have suffered physically, some mentally, some have suffered socially, and while others financially. These have been trying times for one and all. Everyone has been busy adjusting to their new lifestyle of wearing masks and plastic gloves, using sanitizers, maintaining social distancing and working from home.The LGBTQ community is no exception either and has not remained immune to the vast spread Corona Virus and its pandemic.Lesbians, Gays, Bisexuals, Transgenders and Queers have been suffering an emotional turmoil from the day lockdown has been imposed in their respective states. With the Pride celebrations cancelled or postponed worldwide and sensitization programmes halted, the lives of millions of people from this community has come to a standstill. Almost 220 Pride festivals this year were either cancelled or postponed keeping in view the current situation. Many such events were though held online, but they failed to heighten the spirits of the poor souls.In addition to this, more than half of the people belonging to the LGBTQ group were left isolated due to the global crisis. The pandemic put a lock on the social life of many of them. Many of them returned to their respective family homes, only to face the stigma from which they had earlier escaped. They were left isolated in their homes, though they were living between the people who are their own family.The pandemic times have proved to be beautiful for the rest of the world as far as spending quality time with the family is concerned. Life for millions started to centre around their neighbourhood and locality all over again. People who had forgotten the men and women, amongst whom they had grown up, due to their globalized life and job commitments, were back to their roots living back their past memories and reliving the joys of a neighbourhood based social life. But there are the people from the LGBTQ community, yet today trying to adjust to their long forgotten lives. They are now back, living amongst those from whom they had run away to enjoy their life to the fullest and to have their right of freedom. Their lives collapsed as they were called back to their past world of ignorance and social trauma.These people are aware that their families and society have not accepted their sexual identity even today in the 21st century. They fear of being ridiculed and looked down upon by the same people whom they consider their own. This fright has led them to an emotional and mental isolation. They have been yearning for the love and acceptance from their own people. And in its absence their lives have started to feel hollow.Though there are many who have already confided to their families about their sexual orientation (some being accepted, while the others disowned or forced to live the lives according to their ‘narrow-minded’ society), yet there are many who have failed to confess the truth to their loved ones due to the fear of abandonment. Such people have had a worse life during the pandemic as many of them felt suffocated in their very own homes. Their inability to express themselves has shackled them and they feel that their lives have turned into a prison.Not only this, there are innumerable transgenders who have been suffering an economic crisis particular to them. As if the social pain and emotional strain was anyway less for them, there are many whose financial crisis has exceeded the unbound lengths of seas. There are many transgender groups who gain their livestock by begging. Also, in our own country India, the presence of transgender group is considered auspicious on weddings and on the birth of child. They are called and paid in return of the countless blessings they bestow on the newly-weds and the newly-born. But with the lockdown imposed and the mobility of each and every individual restricted and strictly surveilled, they have failed to reach such people and have incurred huge financial loss. There is a need to feel their suffering as our own and come forward to bring their lives back on track, like we all have been supporting each other in these tough times of Corona crisis.All this calls for the human rights of the LGBTQ community who are either facing the social stigma of being what they are or are killing themselves from inside by not just keeping indoors, but also hiding their feelings in their hearts. There is an urgent need to sensitize the heterosexual society towards them. We all need to realise that they aren’t different from us, instead they are one amongst us only and neither do they need our sympathy nor our intolerance. What they need is just our love, compassion, understanding and empathy which are what we all also require. Their demands are no different from ours. They are equal to us and they only seek acceptance from the world which is rightfully theirs. It is high time that we recognise this fact and treat them as equals and live on this earth with harmony while celebrating ‘our’ brotherhood.In this week of ‘Human Rights’ let us all embrace the feeling of universal brotherhood!

    "data": "The article is written by Nancy Chaturvedi of Jagran Lakecity University, Bhopal and curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National law University. The appellant was convicted under punishable offence of section 18 of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985 and was sentenced to rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years and to pay a fine of one lakh Rupees in default of payment.For brief Chand Singh along with other police officials were passing by the Carnal Minor bridge in their private jeep on patrol duty, the accused carrying a bag in right hand turned towards the southern end on seeing the police, he was apprehended on being suspicious. The search operation in the presence of ASP Abohra was done on spot as the provision of law.1 kg 750 gram of opium was found. Two samples of 10 grams were separated and rset was sealed and kept in possession. An FIR was lodged sending Ruqa to the police station, the accused was arrested and was challaned on completion of investigation charging him under section 18 of the act which he pleaded not guilty and went for trial.To prove the charges prosecution brought in 4 witnesses and examined all incriminating circumstances against him, the accused pleading false implication showing no evidence in defence. The Learned Special judge appreciating the oral and written documentary sentenced a rigorous imprisonment of 10 years with one lakh fine in default to undergo a year imprisonment.Aggrieved moved to the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh where his appeal was dismissed holding to the judgment of the Special Judge.It was contended by a senior counsel that the link of evidence was incomplete and that one of the witnesses was not examined therein pleading violation of section 50 of NDPS act. The senior counsel also mentioned that the witnesses were police officials and the evidence does not stand vitiated. Reliance was taken of State of Punjab v. Baldev Singh (1999) 6 SCC 172, Surendra v. State of Haryana (2016) 4 SCC 617. The mere fact that there may have been a seal cannot lead to any presumption in absence of the examination of ASI Balwinder Singh. Likewise, it was also a subject of investigation why PW1 did not make any roznamcha entry of the seized property and the reason why he retained the case property and sample in his private custody in a rented house despite the availability of a malkhana adding on there was a delay in sending it to chemical analyst. The trial court held that the investigation officer was also a complainant who could have been investigated on certain grounds which the prosecution tainted was reversed by the High Court.Seeking the Kerala High Court the F.I.R was a gospel truth and investigation an empty formality. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution ensures a fair and just investigation and trial which stood neglected in this case. An investigation is a clear explanation of what occurred and why it occurred; it has a collection of facts leading to a burden of proof. The word systematic suggests that it is whimsical involving various steps, the fact is mere information and synonymous to truth.The law in regard of Article 21 is to be laid down with certainty the importance of fair investigation. Manhandling can only lead to abuse to lawyers, police officials, judges and would create confusion and uncertainty which should be avoided.It is therefore very much important to lay down essential fair postulates and conduct fair investigation. Justice must be seen and not just done. Any biased or pre-determined conclusions must be avoided.The prosecution is held to be vitiated because of the infraction of the constitutional guarantee of a fair investigation. The appellant is directed to be set at liberty forthwith unless wanted in any other case. "

    "data": "This article has been written by Ipsita Rout from KIIT School of Law and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law.INTRODUCTION The word inmate means any individual who is held in custody in prison or jail because he/she has committed an act prohibited by the law of the land. A prisoner who is also identified as an inmate is anyone who is disadvantaged of liberty against their will. Through forceful restraint or confinement, this freedom can be deprived. The rights of prisoners deal with the rights of prisoners behind bars. Prisoners have fundamental legal rights that cannot be taken away from them. The fundamental rights umbrella the right to food and water, the right to have a lawyer defending them, the right to protect themselves from torture, violent acts and cultural harassment. The term prisoner is defined by Section 1 of the Prison Security Act, 1992. As a result of any necessity imposed by a court or otherwise to be placed under arrest in legal custody, the word prisoner means any person who is in prison for the time being.VIOLENCE WITHIN BARS Violence and coercion between prisoners in many countries can lead to serious health risks, either directly or indirectly. Physical assaults – even murders – can occur in remand prisons, and sometimes even in colonies. Assaults take place between prisoners and prison guards, and even further between prisoners themselves. Violence amongst prisoners – and in particular, sexual misconduct – is widely underreported, as an inbuilt “omertà” seems to be common in the prison environment. There are many causes of violence in prison settings. Clashes can have ethnic causes, or rivalries between tribes or gang members. Closed, often vastly congested living conditions also lead to conflict between prisoners. The tiresome prison environment-a lack of mind and body occupation and just plain boredom-leads to accumulated struggles and tensions. This environment leads to high-risk activities such as drug use, sexual activity between men, tattooing and other “blood brotherhood” themed activities. Some people indulge in these tasks to combat boredom. Others, however, are required to engage in coercive power or monetary gain. Risky lifestyles can lead to the spread of diseases from prisoner to prisoner and if uncontrolled, present a severe risk to public health. Brutality in prison systems makes unsafe contact with human blood possible. Fortunately, HIV contamination due to exposure to open wounds has been reported to be extremely low. Prisoners have the right to be shielded from these dangerous conditions in prison and to demand the authorities to safeguard them from physical and sexual abuse. This right goes beyond the right to apply for detention in safe isolation. Prison administrations should be in a position to maintain a secure atmosphere for the general population without having to resort to such drastic steps, by having skilled personnel in adequate numbers.HUMAN RIGHTS AND PRISON INMATES All humans, and this obviously includes inmates, have some unalienable rights, which are recognized by universally recognized instruments. Human rights have been validated and enshrined in treaties and agreements ever since the Second World War. In 1948, the United Nations General Assembly ratified the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Later two treaties were adopted by the international Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) as well as the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR). They note that prisoners have rights even though they are stripped of their liberty in detention. Primarily, the ICCPR contends that all individuals deprived of their liberty should be viewed with humanity and honour for the intrinsic dignity of the human person. In 1955, in its Standard Minimum Rules for the Safety of Prisoners (SMR), the United Nations developed requirements that include principles for the provision of health care in detention. The 94 rules in the SMR setting out the minimum standards for prisoners were accepted by the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, which expanded their scope in 1977 to individuals detained without charge, i.e., in locations other than prisons. Over the years, these standard minimum standards for the security of persons in custody have been complemented by additional instruments. The United Nations ratified the Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment in 1984. In 1985, the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Regulation of Juvenile Justice, called the “Beijing Rules,” was introduced for the safety of youth offenders. In 1988 and 1990, the United Nations adopted the Framework of Principles for the Security of All Persons under any form of Custody or Jail and the Fundamental Principles for the Care of Prisoners. At the regional level, the European Prison Rules were established by the Council of Europe in 1987. Traditionally, regard for even fundamental human rights has been an issue in prisons. In Europe in particular, substantial efforts have been made to shield prisoners from abuses of their basic rights, as shown, for example, by the European Convention against Torture. The Council of Europe has developed a formal body, it is the Committee to Prevention of Torture and Cruel or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, known as the CPT, to monitor ill-treatment and circumstances of prisoners, including health issues. Many other non-governmental organizations are now tracking prison conditions, in particular all aspects of prison health.CONCLUSION The Supreme Court of the United States in Manna v. the people of Illinois argued that life is not simply an animal nature. The souls behind the bar cannot be denied the same thing. The rights granted by Article 21(Right to Liberty of Life) are for every citizen, and even the State could not deny them. Prisoners also have all the rights that a free man has under some constraints. Only being in jail should not strip them of their human rights."

Manikumar & Justice Shaji P. Chaly Petitioner: Kabeer C Alias Aneera Kabeer Respondent No.1: Secretary (Dept. of Social Justice, Thiruvananthapuram) State of Kerala Respondent No. 2: Director (Dept. of Social Justice, Thiruvananthapuram) Respondent No.3: State Police Chief, Vazhuthacaud, Thiruvananthapuram Provisions Involved: Articles 14,15 and 21 of Constitution of IndiaKABEER C ALIAS ANEERA KABEER VS. STATE OF KERALA Issue:Whether the Transgenders specifically discriminated in providing relief measures during lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic period & whether Article 14,15,21 were violated by any Arbitrary behaviour of the authorities regarding the matter?Facts:The petitioner who is a Transgender filed a PIL, alleging that the above-mentioned respondents have not properly ensured the distribution of ration, medicines, access to medical treatment etc. to the transgender community in Kerala and discriminated against the transgender community at different levels which have altogether led to the violation of Article 14, 15 and 21 of the Indian constitution. Arguments by the Petitioner: The Petitioner through learned counsel Adv. Thulasi K. Raj made the following submissions: That the Petitioner was banished from her parental house at the revel of her identity and suffered disadvantages of her sexual identity since then and now she is a recognised transgender by the State of Kerala and an Identity card has been issued to her. In her petition, she has referred to the 12th five-year plan that has recommended the empowerment of the transgender community by supporting their education, housing, healthcare, employment etc. Further, she mentions seeking the benefits of SUPRA vs UOI, a precedent that gives the right to the transgenders to self-determine their gender identity. The Petitioner also mentions about a survey on the transgender community carried out in the year 2015 whose report was submitted to the Director of Dept. of Social Justice that revealed 54% of the transgenders earn less than Rs. 50,000/- a year and 58% are school drop-outs before 10th grade and thus, based on this report a Transgender Policy was made. However, the petitioner alleges that during lockdown their community has endured severe crises at the hands of the respondents due to lack of essentials like food supply, medicines, aid to medical recourse etc. and also facing threats of torture from Police Authorities. She also mentioned that several members of her community do not have ration cards and access to food and also they are unable to access community kitchens. She has also submitted that they do not have money to pay rent and thus suffer risks of eviction and even after being entitled to get unemployment allowances, they are deprived of the financial benefits due to arbitrary attitude of the authorities. The Petitioner has also stated that a significant number of transgenders are deprived of the necessities as the authorities are still working according to the census of 2011 where the population of transgenders in the state was 3902 whereas now it has reached to 10,000. Prayer Sought by the Petitioner: In her Prayer, the Petitioner has asked the Court to issue a Writ of Mandamus to Respondent No.1 for – Distribution of ration, vegetables, medicines (including Hormone therapy medicines) to the transgenders by the Respective Authorities. Ensuring access to community kitchens and cooking facilities like LPG cylinders. Providing unemployment allowance to the transgender community till COVID-19 persists. Arguments by the Respondents: Respondent no. 2 through Adv. Gen. Ranjith Thampan and Snr. Govt. Pleader Surin George by filing an affidavit has taken the following contentions to rebut the allegations of the Petitioner. The respondent stated that the Govt. has established scholarships and unemployment schemes for transgenders and made a unique identity card system so that they can easily avail the same. Also, the ration cards of transgenders are marked with T and if anyone in the community does not have a Ration card or there is any issue regarding it, they should approach the Nodal officer of the district for the same. The Respondent further submitted that the Govt. during lockdown is taking enough steps to provide necessities to all without any discrimination and want of ration cards. Further on the non-supply of medicines the Respondent brings it to the notice of the court that only 96 applications were received for the medicines of hormone therapy which were acceptable and due supply was made, all others were incomplete and without a prescription from the medical practitioners and therefore, the demand could not be served. The Respondent also contended that 4 short homestays are instituted in different districts to accommodate the transgender community where all the basic facilities including medicines are provided to them free of costs. And the prime contention is that neither the committee nor the dept. has received any complaint regarding the non-supply of necessaries or eviction threats, nor any police atrocities have been specifically reported and in the event of such complaint the authorities will take action without fail.Judgment: The Court after scrutinizing the submissions and the contentions of both sides formed a view that the submissions by the Petitioner are general in nature and no specific instance of non-supply of essentials, denial of benefits granted by the Apex Court in SUPRA or any case of police atrocities have been specifically stated in the pleading. Further, the Court observed that indeed there is a list of 5 persons who have not received the essentials but the statement of respondent no.2 filed on affidavit displays that committees have been established for such grievances and any complaints should be registered with them. The State Govt. seems to have taken enough measures for the welfare of the transgender community and Authorities have been established for the purpose, now it is for the members of the community to approach the authorities to claim the rights they are entitled to. The Court also found in the contentions by the respondent that the medicines could not be supplied without a proper prescription and the authorities are prohibited by law to do the same. Also regarding the identification, the Court opines that the identification of a transgender involves the issue of Right of Privacy guaranteed by Article 21 of Constitution of India and therefore unless a person approaches the authorities, they cannot reveal and recognise the gender identity on their own and without a proper medical examination. Otherwise, there are no reasons to deny facilities to the transgender community. The Court thus disposed of the Writ Petition with the following guidelines: The named 5 persons in the petition if approaching the Authority for supplies, they shall be supplied the same and their grievances shall be sorted. The supply of medicines should be ensured by the state policy. When any member of the Transgender community approaches the Nodal Officer, appropriate steps must be taken for identification and issuance of identity cards. Any other issues raised by the transgender community must be addressed properly.Conclusion: The Decision of the High court simply justifies very old yet prominent feature of the administrative system i.e. Hierarchy must be followed, as it forms the view that in case of any discrepancies or irregularities, a person should first report the Authorities created for the purpose. Also, this decision firmly clarifies that even a person approaching a constitutional court with public interest litigation should provide necessary materials, facts and figures enabling the constitutional court to rely upon the same and issue appropriate directions to the State and its authorities"

    "headline": "French Censorship and its Global ImpactSC to decide on Nirbhaya case today: Will the Daughter of India get justice?Brief on Right to Privacy JudgementSC allows Asaram to be brought to AIIMS for medical check-up",
    "data": "This article has been written by Dakshita Sharma Katare & Curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater Noida. Imagine that one gets up in the morning being told that if he clicks a policeman’s photograph, he will be jailed! This might sound horrifying, but it is the truth. The French Parliament has proposed a new law, Loi relative à la sécurité globale (law on global security) that includes security legislation covering issues regarding policing in France. This bill is being criticized globally with Article 24 attracting most criticism.The clause 24 of the bill would criminalize the publishing of any photos or videos of the police officers or gendarme that recognizes them, there being an intent to harm their “physical or psychological integrity,” if brought into action. Article 24 bans “disseminating, by any means or medium whatsoever, with the aim of harming their physical or mental integrity, the image of the face or any other identifying element of an officer of the national police or member of the national gendarmerie when acting during a police operation.” Also, anyone who will be found violating this law will be entitled to one-year imprisonment along with a fine of €45,000. This bill was later amended to include a precision that the intent to harm must be “manifest” and the law should not interfere with freedom of press.Though this last-added clause seems relieving but, it actually is not. It is quite broad, and perspective based. This is because a journalist might be detained as his act of covering some news may seem to provide the policemen a negative vibe and this act of his may appear to be an act of ill-intent to them. This would increase the power of the policemen manifolds and may create unrest in the nation. Also, one may see that even if the journalist is released or acquitted later by the courts of justice, the biggest damage suffered by him could never be compensated. Here, the damage will not be the loss of time; instead, it will be the loss of an important piece of news that can never be recovered.It is important to note that a similar bill proposed in the spring session of French Parliament has already failed once. The element that makes this bill distinct from the previous one is that it has the support of the Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin, who told BFMTV, “My job as interior minister is to protect those who protect us. I had made a promise, that it would no longer be possible to broadcast the image of the police and gendarmes on social media. That promise will be kept.” This has made the situation difficult for all becoming the cause of worry to many citizens, activists, and organizations. The stance of the Interior Minister clearly shows the fate of this bill in the Parliament. Nevertheless, this bill will not turn into a law unless both the French Parliament Assemblée Nationale and the Senate pass it, unanimously.International organizations like Reporters without Borders (RSF), Amnesty International, the United Nations, and French Human Rights Defenders, fear that this bill if adopted, will strangulate the freedom of press.Many human rights organizations argue that such restrictions will not just hamper the freedom of press but will also become a threat for the citizens. This bill is open to interpretation and it might cause issues for non-journalist citizens too. This can be seen as one creating a negative apprehension of a person standing in front of a policeman with his camera ‘on’.Though this bill does not ban shooting and filming of police officials altogether, its ‘intent’ clause is indefinite, and its ambiguity can become a serious threat to a person’s right to life and personal liberty.Globally, it can impact the lives of all those who visit France for tours as their one photograph or video might turn on the politics and be considered as a crime. Also, this restrains the French journalists’ right to free practice of occupation and the right to free press of journalists worldwide. It also poses a huge question on the severity of censorship as good censorship has always been promoted.This bill is being considered controversial and is highly debated worldwide. If this bill got passed, it will not just cause a huge suffering to human rights, but also will give the other nations’ government the liberty to bring and enact similar laws restricting personal rights. Thus, this bill should not be passed on international level as it will promote censorship, proving to be a big blot on human rights.It is very crucial to protect the rights of the policemen after the yellow vest spring riots in France, but not at the cost of the rights of the journalists or citizens of the country. This bill aimed at increasing the security of the citizens might ironically make them vulnerable to security threats, if passed."

GNCTD: UNFAIR TO EXPECT CHILDREN ORPHANED DUE TO COVID TO PROCURE DOCUMENTS FOR AVAILING BENEFITS UNDER WELFARE SCHEMES: DELHI HC",
    "data": "This article has been written by Aayushi Kiran from The ICFAI University, Dehradun and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.Introduction Nowadays, Ola, Uber, and other cab services have made commuting easy and hassle-free. Late at night when public transport is not available, many of us prefer traveling by these cabs. In urban areas, most people rely on cabs and cab drivers to cover a short distance, and therefore our commute life is dependent on cab services. Using these cab services becomes a necessity for those people who have just shifted to a new town or city away from their hometown either for work purposes or study purposes. Rhe most convenient way to commute from their workplace to their home is by using cabs like Ola or Uber. Despite considering all the risks and factors of low safety measures, a person (especially women) has to opt at last for Ola or Uber because of the need and interdependency on the vehicle as a means for transportation. As the booking of these cabs is done online and within a very short time phase, it is next to impossible to know much about the cab drivers as it is based on a random choice. Therefore, it is highly advised to be extremely vigilant while traveling alone at odd hours. On a regular basis, we hear the headlines such as:- In Bengaluru ‘Cab driver arrested for misbehaving with female passenger’ Uber cab driver arrested for misbehaving with a woman passenger Hyderabad: Cab driver misbehaves with a woman arrested In the headlines stated above the common word found is either ‘WOMAN’ or ‘FEMALE’, and to no doubt, women have been easy prey for these cab drivers. But the main questions are – till how long will this continue? And despite the laws made in our nation and punishment levied upon these misbehaving cab drivers how dare they repeat these acts? If A Cab Driver Misbehaves With A Woman Who Is Alone And Tries To Snatch Her Belongings Forcefully He Will Be Made Liable Under Section 509 of IPC – According to this Section “whoever, intends to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any word, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy (a fundamental right) of such woman, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, and also with fine. In the case of State of Punjab v. Major Singh, the Supreme Court ruled that the act of outraging the modesty of a woman is not limited to any particular age group and that a woman’s modesty lies in her being female by sex and therefore, a woman possesses modesty from the time she is born as a girl. Section 503 and 506 of IPC – Section 503 defines criminal intimidation. The elements required to complete any offense under this Section are: Threatening a person with any injury- to his person, reputation or property The intention with which the threat made- To cause alarm to that person, or To cause that person to do any act, he is not legally bound to do for avoiding the execution of threat, or To cause that person to do something he is legally entitled to do to avoid the threat that may arise if he did it. Section 506, states about the punishment of Criminal Intimidation: The provision of criminal intimidation is divided into two parts- In simple cases, the offender is liable to be punished for the imprisonment of two years or a fine or both. The offense is classified as non- cognizable, bailable, and compound offense under the trial of any Magistrate. The cases which involve death or grievous hurt, destruction of property, or any illegal act which attribute unchastity to a woman, the prescribed punishment is simple or rigorous imprisonment for a term of seven years, or a fine or both. The offense here is classified as non-cognizable, bailable, and non- compoundable offences, the trial is carried under the Magistrate of First class. It is very important that for an offense to fall under the second category, the threat is either causing death or grievous hurt. For example- Ms. Arora booked a cab from Airport to her home and when she asked the cab driver to switch on the AC, the driver refused to, snapped the car and said that the car did not belongs to her father and abused her verbally and even humiliated her and when she said to stop the car, the driver hit her and tried to snatch her belonging. Based on the complaint, the police registered a case of criminal intimidation and arrested the driver. Section 354 of IPC – This Section of IPC criminalizes any act by any person which amounts to assault or use of force against a woman with the intention or knowledge that will outrage her modesty. For such offenses, there can be simple or rigorous imprisonment of 2 years, fine, or both. Section 354(D) of IPC – Stalking is therefore defined as Any man who follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such woman; or Any man who monitors the use by a woman of the internet, email or any other form of electronic communication, Commits the offense of stalking; Anyone who commits the offense of stalking is punished on first conviction with imprisonment up to 3 years and with a fine, and for first conviction up to 5 years and with a fine for a second or subsequent conviction. For example:- A woman hired the cab service for commuting from her office to her home, it was stated by the women that the driver kept looking at her through the rear-view mirror and kept whistling. The cab driver misbehaved with her and also indulged in hurling abuses at other motorists who overtook his car. After the woman reached her destination he marched behind her into the building lobby towards the elevator where he made lewd gestures at her. At now the contact number was saved with him he began calling her and started harassing. Even though the woman blocked her number, the cab driver tried contacting him from another number and said abusive words against her. Experiencing this for over a week the woman filed a complaint against the cab driver. It was traced that a similar complaint has been lodged against him. The cab driver was booked under Section 354 (D) of IPC, which is bailable in nature. Section 378 and Section 379 of IPC– According to Section 378 if anyone intends to dishonestly take any moveable property out of the possession of any person without that person’s consent, moves that property in order to such taking is said to commit theft. Snatching anything from any person is also included in the ambit of Section 378. Section 379 states that whoever commits theft shall be punished for imprisonment of either description for a term of three years, or fine or both. Example- If a cab driver misbehaves with a woman who is alone and tries to snatch her belonging the cab driver will be made liable for snatching and theft under sec 379 of IPC as well under Section 354 for theft and outraging the modesty of a woman.Safety measures women should opt while traveling alone in Cabs:- Send The Cab Details To People You Trust – Cabs services send an automatic generated SMS about the car number, car type, driver name, and driver’s phone number. No sooner did you receive the SMS, forward it either to your family member or to the people you trust. Ask For A Photo Id Proof From The Driver Before Boarding –Photo ID proof may include driving licence, company ID, or any authentic ID proof. Keep An Eye On The GPS -Most of these cabs have a GPS tracker that can help your reliable source to track where your cab has reached or how far away you are from home. For example, Uber has an option where you can select up to five emergency contacts. Select them and then request a ride. Mostly prefer to do this at the beginning of the journey or anytime in between. In case your cab does not have a GPS system, you can also share your GPS location from your phone to your family. Share Cab – Now a days Share cab is the new option is available. Using this option one can share their ride with other people travelling in the same direction. This option is inserted to make sure you are not travelling alone. Simultaneously this feature provides you with the details of your co-travellers. Prefer A Familiar Route – You can always tell the driver to take which turn to take and which to skip. This will ensure your safety and you will know where you are going exactly. If you are using that path for the first time pay attention to the road and keep on noting down landmarks and turns that you think are important. Talk To Someone Continuously – Keep posting your family or your friend about where you have reached and how long you think you will take to reach home. Just make sure that you do not divulge any private or personal details and do not assume that the driver does not understand what you are speaking. Keep Few Requisites – Keep a pepper spray, deodorant or a small knife and use it when you feel that despite your repetitive warning Never Fall Asleep – While you are travelling, especially in the night. You might lose track of your route, which can put you at risk. Conclusion Gone are the days when we had to give-in arbitrary prices to the auto and taxi drivers. Today, working women across the country would prefer a pick-up, instead of taking a rickshaw or taxi from the streets. Ola and Uber’s rides are considered to be safe means of journey for women. Receiving the driver and vehicle details beforehand, receiving a link that can track the ride is so reassuring, yet sometimes there is a set of possible outcomes that may arise from a system that provides no transparency or accountability. India has struggled to bring information technology-based transportation aggregators like Uber and Ola under regulation, and one can only wait to see if the Motor Vehicles (Amendment) Bill manages to usher in some changes to the situation. Over the last few years, popular cab services have faced scrutiny for the continued risk to women’s safety and several cases have been reported of harassment, sexual advances, and rape, which bring into question the safety measures implemented by such agencies. Therefore, each and every woman should take proper measures while traveling and opting for these services."

    "headline": "DISHONOR OF A CHEQUEIncrease of Domestic Violence Cases against Women during LockdownDIGITALIZATION OF COURT PROCEEDINGS: – A NEW WAY TO INDIAN JUDICIARYHOW FAR ARE THE LAWS OF ADULTERY JUSTIFIED?",
    "data": "This article is written by Yagni Sarvankar of University of Mumbai Law Academy and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.A cheque is a document which orders a bank to pay a specific amount of money from one person’s account to another person’s account. Here, the first person who issued the cheque to another is known as the Drawer and on the other hand, the one who receives/accepts the cheque is known as the Drawee. It’s a non-cash transaction. According, to The National Provincial Bank circa 1968, ‘an unconditional order in writing drawn on a Banker, signed by the drawer, instructing the Banker to pay on demand a sum certain in money to or to the order of a specified person or to Bearer and which does not order any act to be done in addition to the payment of money.’ A cheque being bounced is one of the most common financial offences that can land the issuer of the cheque into trouble. A cheque gets bounced only if the issuer writes a bad cheque i.e., due to mismatch of signature, or overwriting, or post-dated, or stale cheque, or frozen account, or stop payment instructions given to the bank or insufficient funds in the account. The cheque is then returned as unpaid or dishonored. After the cheque is dishonored, the drawee bank issues a ‘Cheque Return Memo’ to the banker of the payee mentioning the reason for non-payment. The payee’s banker then gives the dishonored cheque and the memo to the payee. The holder or payee can resubmit the cheque within three months of the date on it if he believes it will be honored the second time. However, if the cheque issuer fails to make a payment, then the payee has the right to prosecute the drawer legally. The payee may legally sue the defaulter/drawer for dishonor of the cheque only if the amount mentioned in the cheque is towards discharge of a debt or any other liability of the defaulter towards the payee. If the cheque was issued as a gift, towards lending a loan or for unlawful purposes, then the drawer cannot be prosecuted in such cases. According to Section 138 of Negotiable Instrumental Act, 1881, there are three negotiable instruments namely promissory notes, bills of exchange and cheques. The word ‘negotiable’ means transferable for consideration and ‘instrument’ means a written document which creates a right in a favor of a person. Thus, a negotiable instrument means a document (sum of money) transferable by delivery. There are mainly six offences under Section 138. Following are the ingredients needed to constitute an offence under this Act: On receipt of a legal notice or summons, the defaulter can settle the payment amicably out of the court at any time or proceed with a lawyer for the hearing, at the court where the complaint has been registered.Explanation of the given section: For this section, debt or other liability means a legally enforceable debt or other liability. Dayawati v. Yogesh Kumar Gosain.The issues need to be examined from the point of view of the Criminal Procedure Code (Cr.P.C), 1973. Section 177 Cr.P.C, 1973 provides that every offence shall be tried by the court within whose jurisdiction it was committed. In Harman Electronics (P) Ltd. V. National Panasonic India (P) Ltd., it was held that offence under Section. 138 of Negotiable Instruments, 1881 is governed by Section 177 of Cr.P.C, 1973 with respect to territorial jurisdiction.The Supreme Court in N. Harihara Krishnan v. J. Thomas held that the offence under Section 138 is person-specific. The general concept under Cr.P.C, 1973 is that cognizance was taken against the offence and the offender was not appropriate in prosecution under Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881. The first ingredient which constitutes the offence is the fact that a person drew a cheque. Here, the identity of the drawer of the cheque should be known to the complainant i.e., payee, to start the trial. There will be a dispute only if the person alleged to have drawn the cheque denies the very fact, but other than that, the other facts are required to be proved for punishing the alleged drawer of the cheque, but for that also the payee shall follow steps given under Section 138. According to the Negotiable Instruments (Amendment) Act, 2018, the drawer of the cheque has to pay interim compensation to the complainant in summary trials or a summons case where he pleads not guilty to the accusations in the complaint. Furthermore, the interim compensation shall not exceed 20% of the amount of money of the cheque and shall be payable within 60 days from the date of the order. The Amendment also empowers the Appellate Court, hearing appeals against conviction under Section. 138, to direct the appellant to deposit a minimum of 20% of the fine or compensation awarded, in addition to the interim compensation.There are further various consequences of a cheque being bounced which can affect the cheque drawer:Penalty from the bank: If the cheque gets bounced due to insufficient funds in the bank account or there has been any irregularity in the signatures or due to some other technical issue as mentioned earlier, the drawer (accused) and the drawee (complainant) are imposed with penalties by their respective banks.Negative Influence on the CIBIL score: CIBIL score or Credit Information Bureau Limited score is a 3-digit number, fluctuating between 300 to 900 which is used by banks and Non-Banking Financial Companies (NBFCs) to determine a person’s credit suitability and the chances of repayment of the loan amount of money on time by that person. The tag of a cheque bounce can be damaging towards the CIBIL score of accused and he may not be allowed loan ever again by any financial institution. So, to maintain the CIBIL score, every person must avoid the cheques being dishonored and maintain more than the minimum balance required in the bank account, even after the cheque has been converted into money.Further, as per the RBI guidelines, banks can stop issuing cheque book facilities to the ones whose cheques valued at Rs. 1 crore has bounced repeatedly at least four times. Offences under Section 138 of the Act is primarily a Civil wrong wherein the burden of proof is on the accused in view of Section 139 but the standard of such proof is the preponderance of probabilities. The same has to be normally tried summarily as given under Cr.P.C. A drawee can file a Civil or Criminal action against the drawer, as a cheque being dishonored in all probabilities can result in both Civil and Criminal lawsuit against the Drawer if the payee or drawee does not receive the payment promised. If the cheque dishonored is willful, then the defaulter can be prosecuted under Section 138 of Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 or Section 417 and 420 of Indian Penal Code (IPC) 1960. Under Section 138, the payee/holder must send a legal notice first, then if the drawer is found guilty as a willful defaulter, he can be punished with a prison term of two years and fine as high as twice the cheque amount. Under Section 417 and 420, a non-bailable warrant can be issued. However, in both cases, a case of cheating has to be proven and legal support can be taken only it has been proven. If more than one cheque is bounced, the payee can file separate suits against each dishonored cheque, which can compound issues for the defaulter. CONCLUSION:Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 protects the payee from any illegal act on the part of the drawer. As cheques are commonly used instruments in the business world, the banking sector needs to be protected. It has been seen that there have been many changes in the law in the past few years, regarding dishonor of cheques, especially the jurisdiction. Also, the law promises to aid in the speedy trial in such cases and also bring sanctity to the system by reducing the default of payments. a cheque must have been drawn on an account maintained in a bank for payment of a certain amount of money to another person from that accountthe cheque should have been issued for the discharge, in whole or in part, of any debt or other liability;that cheque has been presented to the bank within three months from the date on which it is drawn or within the period of its validity whichever is earlier; that cheque is returned by the bank unpaid, either because of the amount of money standing to the credit of the account is insufficient to honor the cheque or that it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid from that account by an agreement made with the bank;the payee or the holder makes a demand for the payment of the said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to the drawer of the cheque, within 30 days of the receipt of information from the bank regarding the return of the cheque as unpaid;the drawer of such cheque fails to make payment of the said amount of money to the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque within 15 days of the receipt of the said notice;"

The committee is headed by the President of the Supreme Court Bar Association, Mr. Rakesh Khanna.A Committee of 13 members was set up to recommend to the Chief Minister.There were four schemes incorporated namely:The Bar Council of Delhi has filed a petition at the Delhi High Court to request the Delhi Government to grant medical and term insurance policies to advocates whose names have been registered and approved by the Delhi Government under the ‘Chief Minister Advocates Welfare Scheme’. It was alleged that on March 2020, an advertisement was published by the Delhi Government regarding the registration of advocates in the scheme that will commence from March 2021. The petition states that as soon as the process of registration started, a total lockdown was to be imposed due to the COVID-19 outbreak. Since the last date for registration was March 31, 2020, the Bar Council of Delhi had made repeated requests to the Delhi Government to extend the period of registration, which was extended up to April 14, 2020.The petition also states that according to this scheme, advocates who enrolled with the Bar Council of Delhi, are entitled to register under the scheme. Accordingly, the beneficiary of the scheme was entitled to medical insurance of Rs. 5 lakh and term insurance of Rs. 10 lakhs. Even after the promises made by the government, no schemes were made available during 2019-2020 and even during the disastrous COVID-19 crisis nothing was done. The petitioner further alleges that the respondent did not assure immediate implementation of the schemes, which is prejudicial and detrimental to the interest of advocates, who have already been registered and are eligible as per the scheme.The petition was then moved through the Chairman of the Bar Council of Delhi, Mr. KC Mittal, who alleged that unwanted delay of the welfare scheme has deprived the legal community of its benefits. In the current circumstance especially, immediate orders are necessary to be passed by the court to protect the helpless and needy advocates.Group (Term) Insurance for practicing advocates providing life cover of Rs.10,00,000/- (Rupees Ten Lakhs) per advocate.Group Medi-claim coverage for the advocates, their spouse, and two dependent children up to the age of 25 years, for a family floater sum insured of Rs.5,00,000/- (Rupees Five Lakhs)E-Library with 10 computers loaded with e-journals in all the 6 district courts andCrèche Facility in the proposal to benefit nearly 40000 advocates in Delhi"

    "data": "This article is written by Mansi Vyas from UFYLC, UOR, Jaipur and curated by Rajrishi Ramaswamy from Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad.“To cheapen the lives of any group of men, cheapens the lives of all men, even our own. This is a law of human psychology or human nature and it will not be repealed by our wishes nor will it be merciful to our blindness.” said William Pickens6th December 2019; the day when all news channels, tweets, WhatsApp statuses and Instagram stories were filled with applause for Telangana police. It was the day when Indian police were the heroes and the 4 accused men were the villains of a movie which ended up being real.Even more recently, in 2020, news channels were full of encounter-related news and social media was filled with memes of the encounter of Gangster Vikas Dubey who along with his 5 other men was gunned down by UP police on July 10 and July 3-9 respectively.Indians got too carried away with cinematic feeling the incidents gave. Life is not a movie. The encounters were not only constitutionally wrong but also morally incorrect. This is one of those incidents when asleep citizens wake up for a quick wave of feminism or human rights and go back to their hibernation. It would not have been a problem if it were as simple as it looks, but the thing is, they perceive the wrong idea of what’s wrong and what’s right. They have this sudden rush of heroism through which they tend to forget who the real villains are. With the same rush, police find it heroic to murder merely accused people. Here are a few another encounters:The reason behind these encounters was either selfish interest of police/ political motive or heroic wave. Additionally, India’s conviction rate is 70% i.e. only 30% of the total accused are found guilty. This further decreases the probability of a just encounter.Even if the accused is found guilty, Article 21 states that “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.” The term “person” cannot exclude accused persons owing to the availability of equality before law under Article 14. And the phrase “ procedure established by law” clearly prohibits extra-judicial killings.Furthermore, NHRC and the Supreme Court have already laid down guidelines for preventing unjust encounters. The guidelines if followed properly, could stop unlawful killings but the main lacunae in the guidelines is investigating authorities. It is the police itself which investigates to find the justification for such encounters.The leaders play a vital role in shaping public opinion about things. Yogi Adityanath in a 2017 interview spoke of his “thok do” policy for police encounters. In this policy he not only supports encounters but also promotes them. As a result, there have been 5,128 encounters since 2017 and out of which 103 were killed. This was further highlighted by him as a great achievement of his government. This is the exact opposite of what a democracy should look like. In a country like ours, where the Rule of Law prevails, growing encounter culture is burying it. There actually is no big difference now between heroic encounters and mob lynching. Moreover, in Prakash Kadam vs Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta (2011) it was said that fake encounters are nothing less than cold-blooded murders and the ones who commit it should also be treated like murderers.Way forward:Conclusion: Democracy is a great concept in theory but is quite alike when it comes to practical. More than 43 lakh cases are pending in High Courts alone and 8 lakhs of which are over a decade old. With such disturbing statistics, anyone could get frustrated and start demanding speedy justice. When police have uneven power to make it happen, they don’t hesitate. In their way of fast justice, police should remember that it is to be complemented by justice. As Noam Chomsky said “people with power understand exactly one thing: violence”. The extra power in the hands of police should be taken away. It is saddening how opportunists find a way to mock such situations. Murder is not funny. People need to understand that all lives matter and nobody deserves to die. The whole judicial process exists for a reason. If people could decide what has to be done, why did we ever come up with such a lengthy process? Also, leaders need to limit their speeches for good. Laws need to be updated; this is a problem big enough to be dealt with separately in our law books.Sadiq Jamla was killed in 2003in a fake encounter because he was suspected to assassinate Shri Narendra Modi and other BJP leaders. For the same reason Ishrat Jahan and three others were killed in 2004.In 2008, when Delhi police was only asked to gather information about 2008 September blasts, two suspected terrorists were killed along with an inspector.In 2016 eight people associated with the Student’sIslamic Movement of India were shot dead by Madhya Pradesh police. The deceased, according to police, started firing at police when asked to surrender and in response they were shot dead.The accused should be put under proper custody.Special security measures should be taken to avoid accused from performing actions where encountering is the only option left.Proper trainingshould be provided to police for handling “encounter-needing” situations.Most of the police officers go away with such murders in the name of “private defense”. The boundaries of this defense are often widened for police. Therefore, Criminal laws primarily IPC and CrPC should add provisions specifically referring to encounters.Investigating authorities should not be the police itself.Leaders should be trained to keep their personal opinions to themselves rather than trying to portrait them to be the rightPublic should be made aware of the importance of the rightto life. People should be taught that “killing” is never the answer.Government should see to the frustratingly slow justice system."

    "headline": "Time to Derecognize ‘Scandalizing the Court’ As a Form of ContemptDevelopment of the Concept of Video ConferencingAadi Shakti MissionDecoding New India: CAB and NRC",
    "data": "This article is written by Pratha Waghmare, from the University of Mumbai Law academy, Maharashtra. This article has been curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna“Pledges of contempt for the court scandal itself have become obsolete in this country. The courts are content to leave public opinion with attacks or comments that are contemptuous or scandalous for them. This remark by Lord Morris in a judgment handed down in 1899 is more relevant today given the development that the trio of journalists-writers-lawyers approached the Supreme Court in challenging the constitutionality of the criminalization of “shocking the court”.These remarks by Lord Morris were noted by the Supreme Court of India in 1953 [Brahma Prakash Sharma et al. See Uttar Pradesh state AIR 1954 SC 10] while delivering a ruling in an appeal against the Allahabad High Court order that found six lawyers guilty of insulting the court for “shocking the court”. In that case, the attorneys, who were members of the Executive Committee of a District Bar Association, were found guilty of contempt for passing a resolution relating to the conduct of two judicial officials. However, accepting the apology they presented, the Superior Court sentenced them to pay the costs. But the lawyers attacked this order before the Supreme Court. The Attorney General supported his case and found that any act or publication calculated to diminish a judge’s authority or dignity does not in itself constitute an outrage to the court. The legislation then in force was the 1926 Contempt of Court Act. Referring to the history of the “law of contempt”, the court noted that an act or publication that “amounts to scandalizing the court itself” is a type of disrespect. .The court took note of the observation cited above in the judgment of the Lord Morris Judicial Committee [MacLeod v. St. Aubin [1899] AC 549, [1899] UKPC 51]. However, the court went on to comment that this observation by Lord Morris that contempt proceedings to scandalize the courts have become obsolete in England was incorrect. To justify this comment, the bank relied on a Queen’s Bench ruling in Reg. V. Gray, which invoked its contempt jurisdiction to try a case of ‘scandalizing the courts.Although the constitutional bench put aside the Superior Court ruling and distinguished between the defamation of individual judges and the crime of contempt of court, perhaps, for the first time, it recognized the English concept of “scandalize the court” as a form of contempt. The good part of this ruling is that it noted that if a particular act or publication is a mere defamatory attack on the judge and is not calculated to interfere with the fair course of justice or the proper administration of the law by that court, it is not it is appropriate to proceed with contempt.Parliament, which codified the contempt law some two decades later, defined criminal contempt to include “the publication (whether in word, spoken or written, or by signs, or visible representations, or otherwise) of any matter or l execution of any other act which “(i) scandalizes or tends to scandalize, or lowers or tends to lower the authority of any court”.Contempt to “scandalize the court”: a battle of perceptions on an uneven fieldUK Law Commission Report 2012Although the report does not refer to previous observations made by Lord Morris, the UK Law Commission found that, in England and Wales, the crime had almost fallen out of use by the end of the 19th century. He then claims that the crime was only revived in two successive cases in the 1930s. Understanding its obsolescence, the Commission concluded, in its report presented in December 2012, that the offense of scandalizing the court is, in principle, a violation of freedom of expression which should not be denied without solid justification of principle or practice. The Commission’s recommendation was implemented by the UK Parliament through the issue of the Crime and Courts Law Acts 2013Law Commission of India Report of 2018Although the Law Commission of India took note of the report from its British counterpart, it said the number of cases of criminal contempt in India highlights a different picture than in the UK. In addition, he noted that, in the UK, the removal of the words ‘scandalize the court’ did not change the situation regarding such offenses as they remain punishable under other existing laws: the Public Order Act 1986 and the Communications Act 2003. He added that this is not the case in India and that the suppression of “criminal contempt” will leave a palpable legislative vacuum.The commission also noted that reducing the scope of contempt to include only “intentional disobedience to the Court’s instructions / judgment” would be undesirable due to the continuing need for deterrence against derogatory elements. “If the provisions are so limited in scope, there will be a reduction in the impact. Such a change in the contempt law could potentially diminish the respect or fear of the courts and their authority and functioning; and, there is a possibility that this may lead to an unwanted increase in cases of deliberate denial and blasphemy by the courts.“He said. It is pertinent to mention that apart from a brief discussion on the effects of the contempt law on freedom of expression, the Legal Committee, in its report, did not discuss how it would stand up to the ‘reasonableness’ test.It is time to dismiss the “scandalize” as a form of contemptThe origin of the form of contempt “to scandalize the court” is attributed to an English judge, Lord Hardwicke L. C., who in his 1742 sentence declared that a kind of contempt is to scandalize the court itself. 270 years later, the UK parliament canceled it. The Supreme Court of India in 1953 recognized this form of contempt when it observed the following: “This scandal can manifest itself in various ways but, in essence, it is an attack on individual judges or on the court as a whole with or without reference to particular cases., emanating unjustified and defamatory slander on the character or ability of judges. Such conduct is punished as contempt for this reason which tends to create distrust in the popular mind and undermines the confidence of the people in the courts, which are of primary importance for the parties involved in the protection of their rights and freedoms “. 18 years later, Parliament gave these remarks a legal color. In 2018, the Legal Affairs Committee refused to follow its British counterpart and reported that it is necessary. Now, is it for the Supreme Court of India to decide whether the colonial concept that hinders freedom of expression should be kept in the statute and in the law? Will it review the recognition granted by the Constitutional Court to the form of outrage to the “scandalization of the courts”?It can only be hoped that the Supreme Court will review its comment on Lord Morris’s observation. Perhaps, as the judge said, the courts should be content with letting the public comment with scornful or scandalous attacks or comments."

    "headline": "Honest Concurrent Use In Trademark LawsENFORCEABILITY OF DIRECTIVE PRINCIPLES OF STATE POLICYData Protection and its Importance.Are Pulses Food Grains? Answers Delhi High Court",
    "data": "This Article is written by Himanshu Batar from IMS Unison University, Dehradun.IntroductionA trademark plays a key role with the establishment of a brand. It helps in creating a sense of trust of the customer within the product by just having a look at the trademark. Trademark, by definition, could be a unique sign (comprising of a reputation, word, phrase, logo, symbol, design, et al or a mixture of 1 or more of those elements), used for the aim of prima facia identifying the goods/services of one trader from those of other traders within the market; it’s going to come as no less than a surprise to trademark proprietors that identical or similar mark can exist in respect of identical or similar goods or services and one such exception is “Honest Concurrent Use”.Honest Concurrent use of TrademarkSection 12 of the Trade Marks Act, 1999 provides for registration of a trademark in case of honest and concurrent use depending upon the subjective discretion of the Registrar.The burden of proof under the evidentiary aspect of trademark law says that an applicant is needed to establish prima facie contentions that there is no such person using an identical or similar mark, because it isn’t possible to point out conclusively that there is no such person. The registrar may make note of a state of affairs that might enable it to lift a presumption that according to “the common course of natural events, human conduct, and public and private business” such a situation doesn’t exist. However, if an objection is raised such a presumption wouldn’t be raised. Then the burden is on the objecting person to prove his case in accordance with the principle of section 101 of the Evidence Act, 1872 and he must also prove that the registration of the mark would be of material detriment to him.Landmark Cases In the case of Kores(India) Ltd. v. M/s Khoday Eshwarsa and Son [(1984) Arb LR 213 (Bom)] five factors were laid down as being necessary for determining the registrability of a trademark. These were:In the case of, Goenka Institute of Education and Research vs. Anjani Kumar Goenka and Anr. (2009), the appellant was allowed to use the mark “ Goenka” with a condition so in order to include the name of their trust below the name of their school so as to facilitate a crystal clear differentiation between both the marks. the reason which allowed the use of the doctrine of honest concurrent use was that both the parties started using the mark “Goenka” at the same time and both were based two different locations so there would be minimal chance of public confusion.Circumstances when Honest Concurrent Use can’t be used as a defenseThe defense of Section 12 possesses diluted over time primarily thanks to these reasons:Effectiveness of defence of Honest Concurrent Use in present timesTruth be told, the defence got diluted over time — primarily because of these reasons:ConclusionIn the face given factors it might be significantly harder for parties to use the defence of honest concurrent use, typically because that will require volumes of concrete evidence to be furnished in support of such “honest use”. And even then, the court is more likely to simply accept a ‘reasonably conscious innocent adoption’ of a mark as against ignorant or bad faith adoption of the same.What therefore remains to be finished fledgling businesses may be a thorough trademark search, wide-ranging at the best (online and also as offline), to make sure they’re not close to adopt a mark already in use. For established businesses using their trademarks over a course of their time without having registered it, it might be prudent to apply for registration at the earliest. Every time, it’s necessary to have multiple copies of relevant documents on the side as this can act in establishing the authenticity of adequate measures taken by the concerned party and prepare it for a win, just in case of possible trademark litigation in future.ReferencesThe quantum of the concurrent use of the trademark in reference to the products concerned and also the duration, area and volume of the trade.The degree of confusion likely to ensue from the resemblance of the marks, which is to a sign of the measure of public inconvenience.The honesty of the concurrent useWhether any instances of confusion have actually been proved.The relative inconvenience, which might be caused if the marks were registered, subject if necessary to any conditions and limitations.Well-known Trademarks: The Act provides enhanced protection to Well-known Trademarks. a widely known trademark gets protection in all the classes (NICE Classification) regardless of its registration within a particular class. (Daimler Benz Aktiegesellschaft & Anr. v. Hybo Hindustan)New and innovative methods of advertisements tend to achieve bent a bigger number of potential users. Online Advertisements and advertisements on social media have also contributed to a fast brand building of a corporation or business house.The trans-border reputation of brands or marks: thanks to globalization, the brands are recognized by consumers or customers everywhere on the planet. ( N.R. Dongre v. Whirlpool Corporation)Possibility of brands expanding their business in the future thereby expanding the chances of reaching wider consumers. Therefore the defense that the merchandise or service is different from the merchandise or service on which the mark is already in use is now having a lesser impact, since the earlier proprietor of the mark may expand his business within the future.the likelihood of marks acquiring transnational reputation (as was recognized by the court within the Whirlpool case)The penetrative impact of technology and also the media on the goodwill of the trademarked goods (Indian Shaving Products Ltd. vs. Gift Pack), which suggests brands are now more global than localBrand proprietors’ preference for fancy/coined trademarks and/or use of numerals within the mark, that leaves less room for confusionIncreased diversification of well-known brands into related or disparate industries that leads courts to impose territorial limitationsupon brands pleading the honest concurrent defence, thereby restricting their operations to a particular area (s). Some fine examples are those of the Vranjilal Manilal & Co vs. Bansal Tobacco Co. (2001) and A B Textiles vs Sony Corporation (2007).Lastly, India’s status as a member of the world intellectual property Organization (WIPO) that works to make sure owners of registered trademarks get to shield their marks even in member countries; making the appliance of this defence harder with time.https://medium.com/@shravanipt23787/defence-of-honest-concurrent-use-vis-a-vis-trademark-protection-how-much-longer-will-this-hold-for-c43308f8c92dhttps://www.lakshmisri.com/insights/articles/use-as-trade-mark-sine-qua-non-to-claim-honest-concurrent-use/#https://www.worldtrademarkreview.com/portfolio-management/supreme-court-clarifies-criteria-application-honest-concurrent-use-concepthttps://www.ipstars.com/NewsAndAnalysis/Supreme-Court-provides-guidance-on-honest-concurrent-use/Index/3920https://www.mondaq.com/india/trademark/205794/establishing-honesty-of-the-concurrent-use"

    "headline": "Domicile Based Reservation- A Violation of Equality?Female Genital Mutilation: A Curse to HumanityJustice On Sale: The hefty court feesELECTRONIC SIGNATURE: POSITION UNDER INDIAN LAW",
    "data": "This article is written by Mansi Vyas from UFYLC, UOR, Jaipur and curated by Rajrishi Raamswamy from Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad.Reservation is a hotly debated topic. Whenever it is brought up, opinions of different kinds are raised. Some believe in caste-based reservation, some in economic reservations and the rest don’t believe in reservations at all. But, the one kind of reservation which is not talked about or say, which is the least questioned is domicile-based reservation. Advocates of the first two kinds have come up with a few reasonable arguments on their validity but domicile-based reservations are yet to be validated.Here are a few cases where the constitutional validity of domicile-based reservation was questioned:Firstly in 1955, in D.P. Joshi vs Union of India, though the main matter was about the capitation fee imposed on students who were non-residents, the petitioner questioned the validity of domicile-based classification. The petitioner argued that the rule violates Article 15 of the Indian constitution. The court held that the rule does not violate the Article as there’s a difference between place of residence and place of birth and that the rule was made on the basis of place of residence and not on the place of birth and thus was said to be constitutionally valid.Then in 1984, in Pradeep Jain vs Union of India, Pradeep Jain challenged the domicile-based reservation in medical colleges. He argued that it violates Article 14, 15 and 16 of equality; restricts freedom under Article 19 and also violates Article 301 of Indian constitution. The respondents argued that the reservation was for upliftment and betterment of the local people and their education and hence it comes under “reasonable classification” under Article 14. Thus, the court held that it is not unconstitutional.Again in 2003, in Saurabh Chaudhary vs Union of India, the petitioners challenged practices of educational institutions reserving seats on the basis of domicile and institutional preference. The petitioner argued that Article 15(1) is violated by such practices. The court held that unlike Article 16(2), Article 15(1) prevents discrimination only on the basis of place of birth and not domicile for residence. Reservation on the basis of domicile was said to be permissible in educational institutions.The arguments of the respondents in the above cases can be summed up in the following points:The above arguments can be held invalid as:Way forward:Conclusion:Domicile-based reservation is not a new concept; it has been prevailing since the very beginning. Earlier, people rarely questioned its validity due to mobility and economic barriers but now when the majority of people are capable of intra-state movement, it has become a major issue for everyone. Students who seek admissions in higher and decent institutes suffer the most. It is thus suggested that certain provisions should be added to the practice of domicile-based reservation to make it make it unbiased and nationally universal.Coming up:On 18th August, 2020 the Supreme Court will be listening to the appeals related to constitutional validity of domicile-based reservation within the State Quota for admissions in PG Medical Courses.The given reservation is on the basis of domicile and nowhere in the constitution is domicile-based reservation barred or restricted.The discrimination in the present case is based on reasonable point, i.e. for upliftment of the local people.The reservation is fair as the benefited people would in future serve their indigenous states.In general domicile means a place of residence, where a person lives permanently, or at least for the foreseeable future. Except for avery small percentage of people, people rarely choose their domicile due to cultural, social and economic conditions. Therefore, if seen reasonably, place of birth and domicile should not be treated any differently.India as a nation should be seen as one, if the government is intended to see to the upliftment of the people at all, it should see the neediest first which means it should not restrict to a state or an area level.In many surveys it is found out that there are hardly any people who stay in the same city or state after their higher education, a majority of those people move out to different states.The definition of “domicile” should not be limited to the concept of “states”.Domicile based reservation should be made reasonable by adding several provisions of economic criteria in it.People who are unnecessarily benefited from it should be restricted through said provisions.Certain criteria should be followed to limit the benefit to the same family for generations."

    "headline": "EVOLUTION OF INDIAN LAW IN THE ERA OF DIGITALIZATIONMarital Rape: Still RapeINDIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE VS. NEPTUNE OVERSEAS LTD. AND ORS.Senior Advocate Jethmalani wants Mamta Banerjee to be the Next Prime Minister of India",
    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma of JEMTEC School of Law, Greater Noida andCurated by Nandita Mishra, Chanakya National Law University, Patna.The digital world has been evolving in the country for a decade now and it has come a long way since its inception. The idea of connecting people over social media platforms was still at its nascent stage when suddenly it became a stage for people to raise their voices and concerns over varying subjects and domains. Social Media has played a very pivotal role in expanding the scope of digitalization in the world. Eventually, matters of grave concern in every nation-state began being discussed on such social media platforms and the discussions used to include mass participation from people all across the world. It led to matters, unheard of before, also being discussed and debated amongst netizens given the accessibility and reach of internet and it became democratic due to the inclusion of voices which transcended social, political, economic and class inequalities.Technology, apart from bringing the social change, acted as a means of operation in various sectors. The reliability started to increase with each passing day and the and digitalization started reaching the rural parts of the state. With the introduction of digitalization across various fields, Indian Judiciary was soon to take a cue and follow the leads.With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, social distancing became a norm across the globe and the courts were left with no other alternative but to evolve and adapt to the changes by conducting the proceedings virtually on various digital platforms. The bane to the Indian courts has always been the pending cases which have been racked up for several years and conservation of the documents pertaining to each and every case. Many jurists have emphasized upon the importance of digitalization and have voiced their opinion about the same due to the backlogging of cases in the courts.The way for technology was first paved in the Indian judiciary in the case of Meters and Instruments Pvt. Ltd. Vs. Kanchan Mehta wherein it was held that certain categories of cases can be partly or entirely concluded online. The judgement also stated that overcrowding in the courts can be avoided by avoiding paperless methods.An estimate shows that there is involvement of over 11 billion sheets in cases filed in the courts annually, which ecologically translates into destruction of lakhs of trees.Smart and exciting technologies such as artificial intelligence, machine learning, data analytics and predictive analytics have already begun to disrupt the legal market.The implications of the pandemic have put light on productive working hours of the courts. Indian Judiciary had to face immense pressure for finding innovative means to draw a balance between access to justice and public health concerns. Some courts have even laid guidelines for non-disruptive video conferencing for handling of cases but this should not be the only way or solution to keep the courts running. Complete digitalization of the judiciary is the need of the hour. E-filing, E-hearing, E-Trials, uniform structure of judgments are the ones which can enable easy search and analytics to spot similar cases. A unique case number that remains the same from the lower through to the apex court and a government mandated app to inform the clients about their next hearing, including absenteeism of the judge or opposite party a day prior to the hearing to prevent unnecessary travel and crowding of courts by clients and lawyers, shall further uncomplicate the entire procedure. For this to be enacted and incorporated within the judicial system at the earliest, clerks, lawyers, judges and clients will have to be trained on the working and procedure of using such technology. Experts in the field of Information Technology can be consulted to lend a helping hand in identifying, evaluating and implementing the best technologies. Processes will need to be designed by experienced people to get the best out of the selected technologies.Technology has made inroads in the legal regime in unimaginable ways and it’s not merely limited to making advancements in the management of cases and proceedings. With the advancement of Artificial Intelligence, there has come a new branch of law into existence known as the AI Law. This law has basically been formulated to not only look at affairs of human beings, but also the acts of machines and the problems arising out of it.The case of Music Distribution has come a long way in the Indian subcontinent. The evolution of technology has made very significant impacts in this arena. The process of making music and the distribution of the same has evolved in phases, from music being shared by writing the musical notes on paper to the same being shared via physical recording, to the era of digital recording. The most pertinent issue related to the same is copyright. The surprising part in the instant scenario has been the fact that the advancement of technology comes as a solution instead of the usual entanglement between technology and law. The advanced technology by evolving itself found solutions to the problems that it had created for itself.During the earlier times, the issues related to copyright used to be easily handled via the domestic copyright laws of the state. Problems started to arise with the globalization and development of the digital era. During this phase, the rights of the music directors and creators were seriously hampered due to circulation and demand of pirated CDs whose distribution did not provide the owners with the profits and royalty that they actually deserved. Decades after, the internet became as a source of interconnecting, sharing of the music started taking place via internet. Music was being downloaded without providing the directors and creators of music the royalty they deserved. This was becoming a culture all around the country in such a way that the users did not have an inkling that it was illegal to download music online. In such a situation, it seemed like the technological advancement had created a problem for the music directors and creators.However, the advent of sites like Saavn, Spotify, Amazon Music etc came as a boon for music creators as it started providing music to the people for free along with perks that had costs attached to them, while also paying the creators for their content.In this case, the evolution of technology found a solution to the problem it had itself caused."

    "headline": "AN INTRODUCTION TO FIRIMPORTANCE OF MEDICLAIM POLICYSC gives a Big Statement on Fake Lawyers: Must ReadAPPOINTMENT OF ATTORNEY-GENERAL IN INDIA AND FAMOUS ATTORNEY- GENERALS",
    "data": "This Article is written by Simran from Mody University of Science & Technology, Lakshmangarh and curated by Dheepika R from ICFAI Law School, Hyderabad.The information which is given to police officers and reduced to writing is known as FIR which is also known as the First Information Report. It is a document and maybe put in evidence to support or contradict the evidence of the person who gave the information.Object:The principal object of the first information report from the informant is to keep in motion the criminal law and for investigating authorities is to obtain the information about alleged criminal activity to take serious steps to trace and bring to book the guilty. The FIR in a criminal case is an extremely essential and valuable piece of evidence for oral evidence at the trail.In one of the case Hasib v. State of Bihar AIR 1997 SC 288, it is decided by the court that FIR’s main object to complain of any offense to a police officer so that criminal law could be applied and it does not constitute substantive evidence, it can, however, be used as a previous statement for the contradiction of its maker under section 157 or section 145 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.Police duty to record Information:When the petitioner approaches the police and prays for registration of FIR, the police have no option but to register it and thereafter start an investigation but refused to record a FIR on the ground that the place does not fall within the territorial jurisdiction of the police station amounts to a failure of duty. So, it must be recorded and forwarded to the police station having jurisdiction.What is Zero FIR?It means that FIR can be filed in any police station irrespective of jurisdiction and happening of the incident. The police station under the complaint is filed to mark it as a zero FIR by giving its serial number as 0. In the case, State of Andra Pradesh v. P. Ramulu AIR 1993 SC 2644, It was said that to the extent any FIR cannot be refused to be recorded on the ground that the offense was committed not within the jurisdiction.Constituents:In the case Navratan Mahan v. State of Bihar AIR 1980 N.O.C. 1. SC, it is held that generally it is expected that a detailed explanation of the happening should be given in FIR. But prosecution cannot be dismissed merely on the ground that a complete explanation of the following has not been mentioned in the FIR.Delay in lodging of FIR:Sometimes delay in giving information can be forgiven if there is a satisfactory explanation. In the case, State of Haryana v. Chaudhary Bhajan Lal AIR 1992 SC 604, it is held whenever the office-in-charge of a police station receives information of commission of a cognizable offense it is recorded in the concerned register. The police officer must record such reports without delay.If any information is given orally then it shall be read after recording and signature shall be taken from the person given information. FIR could be in any written or oral. It can also be given on the telephone and email. The FIR is the first version of the incident as received by the police. The statements in the FIR must naturally get their due weight. FIR is not expected to contain all the details of the prosecution case; it may be sufficient if the broad facts of the prosecution case alone appear. Omission in the first statement of the informant is not fatal to the case. The impact of the omission has to be adjudged in the totality of the circumstances and the veracity of the evidence.Importance:Although an information report plays an important role in setting the administration of criminal justice in motion, it cannot be considered concluding evidence. By Information report, police start the investigation. Accused cannot be convicted merely based on FIR, it is necessary to prove the facts mentioned in the report. It is mainly mentioned under Section 154 of CrPC that based on the report the investigation of cognizable offense commences.Conclusion:If a FIR is duly recorded then it may provide valuable evidence and the investigation can be run smoothly and with no obstruction in a criminal case. Such information should be lodged with the police as soon as the police come to know the happening of the incident or commission of the offense. If the police officer refuses to register a FIR, a written complaint can be sent to the superintendent of police."

    "headline": "THE EVER-LOOMING DARKNESS OF LAW OF SEDITIONOne’s Liberty, Another’s ConstraintSummons through Whatsapp: Bombay High Court sets a new benchmarkAmity Noida – IP University Student Commits Suicide",
    "data": "This article is written by “Meghna Jalali” from “Ansal University” and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.A sincere omission used to be ratified, albeit, realized after a decade. With the enactment of the Indian Penal Code Amendment Act, 1870, the regulation of sedition took delivery and in came, the darkest days for the most cherished right- the proper to express. The dystopian society, with the form benefits of the ‘government’ in energy, returned then, was once confused with a draconian law, which unluckily nonetheless finds a vicinity in our society, with no assessments and balances, leaving countless humans destitute. The uproar of our countrymen towards the barbaric atrocities dedicated in opposition to them compelled the authorities in power to implement the regulation of sedition, which had observed its haven in Section 113 of Macaulay’s Draft Penal Code of 1837-39. The enforcement of the enactment of the law, introduced deleterious effects, which until date, tends to relax down the spines of the alleged violator. The Section, as used to be added in 1870, used to be titled ‘Exciting Disaffection’. An act, which perpetrates a feeling of disaffection in the direction of the Government, through phrases or signs and symptoms or seen illustration or otherwise, used to be punishable beneath Section 124(A) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. An exception to the offence was once carved out in the explanation, wherein, the disapprobation of the measures of the authorities which have been in tune with the dogma set out using the authorities used to be now not introduced into the clutches of the offence.Lately, there are numerous eminent personalities such as Mr. Vinod Dua, Mrs. Sudha Bharadwaj, Mr. Varavara Rao and Mr. Gautam Navlakha, who have been booked beneath the old-fashioned law, which law, in my opinion, requires the immediate interest of the Government to defend free speech, which is granted by using our Constitution.The first case of sedition in British India, colloquially recognized as the ‘Bangobasi’ case, was once tried by using a Jury. C.J. Sir Comer Petheram, expounded the regulation to the Jury, as, any man or woman the usage of any word, spoken or written, to his target audience to insinuate the thought of now not obeying the lawful authority or subverting or resisting the authority, would be responsible for the offence, even though, no overt act in pursuance of such non-obeying the lawful authority has been committed.The exceptional and celebrated case of ‘Queen-Empress v. Bal Gangadhar Tilak’ got here earlier than the Bombay High Court. Mr. Tilak was once charged with the offence of developing disaffection in the society closer to the British Rule and its administrators. Justice Strachey defined the law, with a fascinating commentary that a man is guilty if he excites or tries to excite emotions of disaffection; it is immaterial that any emotions of disaffection or enmity closer to the authorities need to have been excited, due to the fact a mere try to excite such a feeling, ensuing, an unsuccessful act would additionally be on the equal footing as a profitable seditious act.The wheels of the regulation of sedition had grown to become with the Government of India Act, 1935, the Independence Act, 1947 and the Indian Constitution of 1950. After Independence, the harrowing regulation has placed its haven below the head “Of Offences in opposition to the State”.The law of sedition was once scarcely used by using the police equipment in the first decade of the twenty-first century, in turn, paving the way for the free glide of ideas, which protected dissent in opposition to the authorities and its policies.The regulation of sedition additionally solidified its eerie shadow upon the maverick lawyer, Late Mr. Arun Jaitley. Mr. Jaitley had penned down his views on the NJAC judgment handed with the aid of the Constitutional Bench of the Supreme Court, which used to be taken with a stern view by way of a Judicial Magistrate of the State of Uttar Pradesh, who had taken suo-moto attention of the article and registered a Complaint towards Mr. Jaitley underneath Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code.The Court held that the article used to be to voice the opinion of the writer to strike a stability between the two necessary pillars of our united states and therefore, using no stretch of imagination, the contents of the article can be stated to create public disease or designed or aimed in opposition to the Government installed through law.AMENDMENTS:In my opinion, the below-listed amendments can be added to the regulation of sedition, to hold a look at the regulation to make sure that the identical is no longer unscrupulously and surreptitiously used in opposition to harmless people.The aforesaid suggestions, if implemented, shall stop the exploitation provided through the regulation of sedition and shall ensure, in letter and spirit, that freedom of speech and expression and propagation of thoughts is the hallmark of democracy.Establishment of a Special Court: A Special Court presided with the aid of the District and Sessions Judge must adjudicate the instances of sedition.Preliminary Inquiry: In instances of sedition, an officer no longer under the rank of Superintendent of Police of the district shall habit a preliminary inquiry about the Complaint and shall post a Preliminary Report containing the statistics incidental to the Complaint and the declaration of witnesses to the Special Court.Timeline: The involved Superintendent of Police, shall put up his record no longer later than ten days from the receipt of the Complaint to the extraordinary court.Interim Order: The Special Court shall omit an Interim Order, primarily based on the Report furnished by way of the Superintendent of Police.Appeal: An Appeal shall lie in opposition to such Order earlier than the involved High Court. The Appeal shall be filed inside a length of thirty days."

    "headline": "An Overview of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019SUICIDE OR HONOR KILLING?Does PM Care Fund come under RTI Act, 2005?Changes after the Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A",
    "data": "This article is written by “Ritika Sharma” from “Ansal University” and curated by Aaryaki Rana from Chanakya National Law University, Patna.The consumer protection bill 2019 was passed by the parliament on 6 August, 2019, replacing the consumer protection act, 1986 with the aim of providing timely settlement of disputes related to consumers. After receiving assent from the president of India, the act got published in the official gazette on 9th august 2019. On 20th July 2020, the consumer protection act, 2019 came into force.E -commerce or electronic commerce is new concept that has developed and evolved in the 21st century. Today it has become an intrinsic part of everyone’s life. Digital marketing is widely used by the business houses. Since this invention, consumers can access the relevant information at any time and at any place on one click. Now, the consumers are better informed about the product, they can compare the price of a particular product, and upon their purchase, the product is made available at their doorstep.But it is not that easy for the businesses to sell their products online. Since the customer cannot touch or feel the product, they often hesitate to buy. To curb this uncertainity, the businesses tend to spend more to build a brand image and goodwill. The major problem faced is making an online payment. Some customers are not deft enough to make an online payment. Privacy of customers is also at stake sometimes, since while doing online transactions they have to share their card numbers and many details. Considering the use of the internet and modern methods for dealing with online sales, Tele- shopping, or any online transaction and also for traditional methods of business, the government has introduced the new act altogether, instead of making an amendment to the 1986 act.Compared to the 1986 Act, many major changes can be seen to the 2019 Act to enhance the protection of consumers. The 2019 Act provides a very comprehensive definition of consumer and unfair trade practices. The 2019 Act has also widened the definition of consumer as it covers the consumers involved in online transactions and includes issues relating to e- commerce. Also, it provides specific definitions for unfair trade practices as it includes sharing of personal information, return of defective goods, etc. within its range.The 2019 Act introduces a concept called unfair contracts which include those contracts which are in favor of suppliers or manufacturers instead of being in favor of consumers or buyers. For instance, it includes contract asking for excessive security deposit for performance of contract, imposing penalty on consumer for breaching contract, imposing any unreasonable charge on consumer or having any obligation or condition which includes, not being hazardous for consumer, etc. Now, a complaint can be filed by the consumer in this regard. One of the most important additions made by the 2019 Act is the establishment of a central consumer protection authority (CCPA) which promotes, protects and enforces the rights of consumers.SOME KEY FEATURES OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT, 2019On sale of adulterated or spurious goods manufactures license will be suspended for two years.With the passage of time, the nature of technology also progresses. To prevent the harm caused by the new technology, there comes the need to amend or change our laws. Compared to the 1986 Act, the consumer protection Act 2019, provides more protection to the consumers. The 2019 act deals with the current age of technology advancement. It includes settlement of disputes involving online transactions, provides an easier way to file e- complaints, and also provides strict penalties on businesses if they do act which results in violating the interest of consumers. Prima facie it appears to be much more supportive and consumer friendly.Includes electronic commerce transactions: 2019 Act, has expanded the scope of definition of consumer. The definition now involvesany person who purchases any product offline or online (through electronic means). The 1986 Act didn’t include e- commerce transactions.Filing complaints through electronic medium: it enables the consumer to file complaints electronically and in consumer commission. It also contains the provision for hearing complaints through video conferencing.Product liability: A new concept of product liability is introduced bythis A It states that the manufacturer or the service provider or the product seller will be responsible if any harm is caused due to defective product or deficiency in service, and hence, should compensate for the same.Mediation: to make the process of settlement of dispute easier and quicker, it introduces the concept of mediation as an alternativedispute resolution mechanism.Penalties and punishments: central consumer protection authority (CCPA) can impose penalty up to rupees one million or imprisonment for up to two years on manufacturersfor misleading advertisements.Other rules: no fees will be charged for cases up to amount of Rs. Five lakhs."

    "headline": "Pre-Trial Prejudice: Time To Identify The Evil In India?SAHARA SUBRATA ROY GETS 10 MORE DAYS TO DEPOSIT RS 700 Cr; BAIL EXTENDED TILL JULY 5BLACK AGE STORY OF INDIAN DEMOCRACY: EMERGENCY AND IT’S IMPACT ON LEGAL COMMUNITYDO’S AND DON’TS WHILE ON AN INTERNSHIP",
    "data": "This article is written by Pratha Waghmare, from University of Mumbai Law academy, Maharashtra and curated by Rajrishi Ramaswamy from Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad.The phrase ‘Constitutional morality’ was introduced in Constitutional Assembly on November 4, 1998 during discussion on administration under the draft Constitution.Babasaheb Ambedkar introduced the phrase and called it an unnatural sentiment, something to be cultivated in Indian society,which he called “essentially undemocratic”. Babasaheb drew a line of conflict between constitutional and social morality and it still exists. Undemocratic nature of society is often reflected in judicial mechanism and takes its worst form in the field of criminal law. Theoretically, right to fair trial is considered to be one of the fundamental principles of criminal justice system. In practice however, this justice often becomes the victim of social realities, which derive from prevailing moral standards and are reflected in various elements of criminal trial.A criminal case consists of both trial and the pre-trial phase. Although from an integral point of view, they constitute a cohesive unit, the consequent effect of irregularities committed during preliminary phase also falls on the impartiality of the process. Strictly speaking, a trial takes place within a courtroom. However, what is ultimately organized within the court is, directly or indirectly, controlled by events outside the court. Witnessing, obtaining attendance, personal cross-examination of defendants under Section 313 Cr.PC, impartiality of prosecutors, police discipline during investigations, proper production of evidence, media reporting, etc. These are some aspects of a criminal trial that are controlled by preliminary events outside the courtroom. Pre-trial events that can cause bias cannot be treated casually. It is necessary to examine its probable impact on the fairness of a process. So far we have avoided any such examination.The expression “pre-trial injury” is borrowed. Taken from Rideau v. Louisiana, this expression is used largely to refer to jury bias in criminal trials. Jury system involves few community members in condemning the accused’s guilt or innocence and since these members come from the community unlike Judges, they have certain social biases. When such social biases adulterate their ability to make decisions, it becomes a case of pre-trial bias. The inclusion of the phrase “before trial” before the word “prejudice” indicates that this prejudice stems from their social and community experiences before they were called to take part in the criminal trial. Under Indian Jury Act, 1826, the jury system was introduced in India and continued (possibly) until the 1973 Code was enacted. The country witnessed a vivid display of jury bias during the famous Nanavati Trial, in which the jury recommended 8-1 acquittal. Session Judge Mehta, in presenting the case for review to the Superior Court, had commented on the famous phrase: “I feel as though our entire law has been tried.”However, it turned out that jury system was not the only cause of preliminary bias. It was one of many possible causes, and although we abolished jury system, other causes continued to reign. Today, India’s criminal justice system faces the threat of news-related bias. Illustratively, there is no law in India to protect the identity of the accused. Since the crime-report phase, a wave of news in media runs parallel to investigative phases. Subsequent speech outside the courtroom soon begins to negatively affect interior processes.To understand this phenomenon, it is necessary to understand elements that come together to build a criminal trial. To come to a decision, a judge must be assisted by professional lawyers, fair prosecutors, innocent witnesses, and disciplined investigative officers. The professionalism of a bailiff would be of little value if he does not receive adequate assistance in the process. Search for justice is a collective task.For instance, a defendant accused of sedition for giving a speech that circulates, misrepresents and speaks widely on the Internet is more likely to end up with an indictment sheet than a closing report. A defendant arrested on a widely reported blatant rape charge is more likely to be subjected to prison violence after arrest, not only by police but also other inmates.The meeting in Hyderabad of 4 “suspects” of group rape was a textbook example of how extreme pre-trial bias could result from excessive public speaking. The 4 suspects, with their photos, names and details of relatives revealed, are biased for life. Did the police wait for identification before publishing information? No. The police felt the need to satisfy society with immediate action.Also, what are the chances that a physician, himself outraged by a widely reported rape, wrongly reports injuries sustained by prison violence on an accused’s body, arrested in connection with that crime?Consider another instance. A witness living in a regressive community is less likely to fearlessly testify in court against an honor killing if it has been a subject of heated discussion in his community. We live in a society where lawyers’ associations adopt resolutions to prevent lawyers from defending defendants for popular crimes. These Bar Associations unify with local sentiments. Would it therefore be an exaggeration to say that such defendants are less likely to be defended by a lawyer of their choice in court? The emphasis comes from Article 22, a fundamental right guaranteed to all by the Constitution.Above-discussed illustrations would reveal that there is no uniform-distortion-phenomenon. However, there is some plausible explanation. When heinous crimes in a largely uninformed society are dealt with extraordinary media coverage without protecting the identity of the accused, the whole community begins to share the trauma of the victims and begins to believe that nothing less than the toughest punishment would be acceptable. What acts as the final nail in the coffin of justice is absence of basic legal knowledge, especially presumption of innocence, both by media and the masses. The impact is unimaginable and unexplored. I feel obligated to borrow the words of Judge Matsch, who in United States v. Mc Veigh said that “the whole state had become a unified community, sharing the emotional trauma of those who had been direct victims”.What collapses under this collective desire to punish is the impartiality and free will of those who play a role in different stages: police, witnesses, doctors, experts, lawyers, prosecutors, etc. They feel the need to exceed society’s expectations with great success and end up being weak links in a trial. Local sentiment prevails over Constitutional sentiment. It is understandable that causes evolve continuously. Indeed, it is precisely this complexity of causes that has allowed these flagrant irregularities to escape the clutches of law.Preliminary bias is not directed only against the accused. The victims also face music occasionally. Let’s venture into monotony of Bollywood and recall the story of a poor girl from the village, gang-raped by some rich men of the community. The incident is followed by the abduction of witnesses, suppression of evidence and denial of legal aid. Local media report it as a suicide and create enough sentiment for witnesses and police to follow the “correct” line. The question here is if trial courts open to such victims on the same terms as others. An even bigger question is whether our courts equipped enough to remedy this pre-trial fiasco.It was noted in Sheppard v. Maxwell (1966) that courts must vigorously enforce measures ensuring non-assessment of balance against accuse in modern conditions. I propose to replace the word “jury” with other members of a trial (police, witnesses, media, etc.) and ask for courts of first instance to effectively control what precedes the trial phase to ensure the trial is not fraudulent in nature.The remedy against most of evil scenarios outlined above is found in Indian High Courts whether through lawsuits under Constitution or appeals under CrPC. While the former is largely inaccessible to most, the latter reaches such an advanced stage that recovering what was lost prior to the process becomes impossible. Criminal proceedings and evidentiary law in India do not have preventive tools against these prejudices. They provide for corrective measures and place a heavy burden on accused to demonstrate “lack of justice” before seeking remedy.Other challenges arise when we understand our jurisprudential approach to the concept of “prejudice”. For example, in Mohd. Hussain v. State (NCT Government) Delhi, the Court observed such prejudice cannot be interpreted generically.It is time to recognize possibility of bias even beyond traditional stages of investigation or trial. Limited meaning of “investigation”, as adopted, has the effect of ruling out a myriad of circumstances that could potentially prejudice cases. and courts of first instance should be empowered for independent examination of pre-trial-bias issues, regardless of causes, and procedural irregularities. For solid foundation of trials, a court must be able to effectively counter such out-of-court bias. When left to appeal forums, confidence on criminal justice system and spontaneity is lost. It is also time for provisions similar to section 228A of the IPC. A defendant has the right to “confidentiality of information” and a fair trial under Article 21, although it requires certain restrictions in the Competitive Press Act. Ever-changing causes of bias must be trapped before Law itself becomes subject of judgment."

    "headline": "Need For Advertising Law in India: The Best Product in the MarketSAVE THE SAVIOURS – Kolkata Doctors’ ProtestChhattisgarh CJ AK Tripathi resigns whereas Justice PK Mishra has been appointedBREAKING: NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL OF INDIA APPOINTED: MAJOR SURPRISE",
    "data": "This article has been written by Shubhangi and is curated by Nandita Mishra, Chanakya National Law University.H.G Wells has famously said, “advertising is legalized lying.” This shows the dilemma surrounding advertising and its effect on consumers. On an average, a person watches around 280-310 advertisements on a daily basis through one medium or the other. Although, we might not pay attention to advertisements consciously, yet sub-consciously they always impact our impressionable minds. For instance, while we might not have made concrete steps towards memorizing jingles or catchy taglines, we have definitely been caught singing our hearts out to “doodh si safedi nirma se aaye, rangeen kapde bhi khil khil jaye, sabki pasand nirma, washing powder nirma“, with our siblings. Nobody took any special efforts to learn the above tagline but it’s naturally embedded in our memories due to the number of times we have watched the instant advertisement. Such are the far-reaching effects of advertisements on our minds which accords them crucial status, consequently, making laws related to them also a critical issue.While the above might be a non-harmful version of advertisements impacting us, in several instances, advertisements tend to exaggerate, promote stereotypes and put forward misinterpreted facts which promotes narratives and lend them a helping hand in percolating deeper in the social fabric of the society. This is precisely why we need specific laws to regulate the same. Several countries, have specific laws and legislations governing the issue at hand. Many countries in Europe do not allow advertising for kids below a certain age. In the U.K. and U.S, there is ‘Advertising Standard Authority’ and ‘Federal Trade Commission’ which lays down standards related to controlling and maintaining advertising in their respective countries.In India, advertisements hold a very pertinent role in the growth of the nation as a developing country. India’s economy is growing every minute and advertisements play a crucial role in impacting the economy and commercial growth. Advertisements generally help in the sales of products or services by making customers aware of the product and persuading them to consume the product and avail the services. The ideal aim of advertisements is to give consumers information about the products so that consumers can make informed decisions. But on occasions, they make over-reaching attempts and start exaggerating and misleading the consumers. Hence there arises a need for stricter provisions to keep these advertisements in check from manipulating people in the wrong direction. These misleading advertisements not only lead to unhealthy competition in the market but also violate the basic rights of consumers.There is no statutory agency or uniform legislation to govern or regulate advertising in India. But there is “a self-regulatory and non-statutory” council known as Advertising Standard Council of India (ASCI). This council was established in 1985 to promote responsible advertising and to enhance public confidence in advertisements. It lays down codes for self-regulation in the advertising industry. They have adopted the ASCI code which has been accepted by the individuals, corporate bodies, and associations concerned with advertising. The ASCI does not have any statutory powers, thus it always leaves the advertisers and the businesses associated with it with the choice to either comply with the code or do otherwise .According to ASCI complaints can be made against any person or industry. The complaints are considered and decided by the Consumer Complaints Council (CCC). The advertiser against whom such complaint is made is asked to either withdraw or modify the advertisement according to the specified standards. If the advertiser does not cooperate, then a one-sided decision is taken. ASCI is bound to comply with the decision of CCC, but not others. The process is time-consuming and by the time the issue is resolved, in all likelihood, the advertisement is said to have already impacted the targeted audience. ASCI is not enough to deal with such a huge problem. It lacks in ability, maintainability, enforcement and standard wisdom to tackle the issue in its entirety. Hence there is a need for stricter and organized legislation to keep a check on the advertising industry.There are other legislations in India for the advertising industry but they lag behind in some way or the other. For example:All these laws attempt at providing provisions for regulating advertising in a complete sense. But these are fragmented legislations which try to cover a wide area of topic. With the growing market and increasing consumers, we need to have stricter provisions so as to protect consumers from fraudulent, unfair, and deceptive business practices. There is a need for well-researched, well-equipped, and well-formulated legislation that will cover every single aspect of advertising and other topics related to it, while giving a broader perspective to this industry.Consumer Protection Act, 1986: Section 2 (r) of the act provides for the definition of ‘unfair trade practices’ which further covers a segment of false and misleading advertisement which influences people in wrong ways and leads to various arguments. Section 6 of this act also provides the consumers with the right to know about the quality, quantity, standards of product, etc. in order to protect consumers and let them make informed decisions.Cable Television Networks (Regulations) Act, 1995 and Cable Television Networks (Amendment) Rules, 2006: Under section 6 of this act, no person can transmit or re-transmit any advertisement through cable service which is not verified under the advertisement code prescribed under the instant rules. The advertisement code is set up in order to ensure that any advertisement does not offend decency, morality, and religious sentiments of individuals.Cigarettes and other Tobacco Products (Prohibition of Advertisement and Regulation of Trade and Commerce, Production, Supply, and Distribution) Act, 2003- Section 5 of this Act, inter alia, prohibits both direct & indirect advertisement of tobacco products in all forms of audio, visual and print media.Doordarshan/ All India Radio (AIR) Advertisement Code- Doordarshan and AIR, both under the control of Prasar Bharati (a statutory autonomous body established under the Prasar Bharati Act), follow a comprehensive code for commercial advertisements which control the content and nature of advertisements that can be relayed over the agencies.Young Persons (Harmful Publications) Act, 1956- Section 3 of the Act, among other things, also imposes a penalty for advertising or making known, by any means, whatsoever, where any harmful publication (as defined in the Act) can be procured from or through any person.Indian Penal Code, 1806- The IPC, vide an array of provisions, prohibits obscene, defamatory publication, the publication of a lottery and/ or statements creating or promoting disharmony/ enmity in society."

    "data": "This article has been written by Himanshu Batar of IMS Unison University, Dehradun and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.Smartphones, tablets and computers have become the sine qua non of existence within the 21st century and are needed for everything, from ordering groceries to hailing a cab, and as much as they have helped us, they also have made us more vulnerable to crime too. Now, we are not just vulnerable in the real or physical world, we are vulnerable in the digital world too, wherein we blindly trust softwares, people or organizations even with our most private Information.Data Protection refers to the set of privacy laws, policies and procedures that aim to minimise intrusion into one’s privacy caused by the collection, storage and dissemination of private data. Personal data generally refers to the information or data which relate to an individual who will be identified from that information or data whether collected by any Government or any private organization or an agency.The world has suffered various data breaches over the years. Closer home, a cybersecurity firm Cyble Inc, on May 23, 2020 found that the information of various Indian job seekers was leaked on the dark web for free of cost. This leak involved sensitive personal data like home addresses, qualifications, work experiences and more. The firm also said that the Aadhaar card details of Indians were also found to have been leaked when the source of the leak was being investigated. This data leak is claimed to have been originated from a knowledge aggregator or resume aggregator, which compiles data collected from various sources. Another report states that the Bhim wallet app website was compromised, in conjunction with sensitive personal data like Aadhaar card number, PAN number, residence proof, bank records etc. The National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI) has however denied this report completely.The Constitution of India does not patently grant the Fundamental Right to Privacy. However, the Courts had included it within the scope and purview of other fundamental rights, i.e., Freedom of Speech and Expression under Art 19(1)(a) and Right to Life and Personal Liberty under Art. 21 of the Constitution of India. However, these Fundamental Rights under the Constitution of India are subject to reasonable restrictions given under Art 19(2) of the Constitution which will be imposed by the State. Recently, within the landmark case of Justice K S Puttaswamy (Retd.) & Anr. vs. Union of India and Ors., the constitution bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court has held Right to Privacy as a fundamental right, subject to certain reasonable restrictions. With respect to this, there are certain provisions that are there to see that this right is not violated. The current legislation regarding the data breaches in India is Information Security Act, 2000.As given under the Section 43A of the (Indian) Information Technology Act, 2000, a body corporate who is possessing, dealing or handling any sensitive personal data or information, and is negligent in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices leading to wrongful loss or wrongful gain to a person, then such body corporate could also be held susceptible to pay damages to the person so affected. It is important to notice that there’s no upper limit specified for the compensation which will be claimed by the affected party in such circumstances. The Government has notified the information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011. The provisions only deals with protection of “Sensitive personal data or information of a person”, which incorporates such personal information which consists of data relating to:- Passwords; Financial information like bank account details or mastercard or open-end credit or other payment instrument details; Physical, physiological and mental health conditions; Sexual orientation; Medical records and history; or Biometric information.Section 43 deals with the compensation in data threat cases; Section 66 deals with the punishments in these cases and Section 69 deals with some of the exceptions. As per the Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, the Government of India can be exempt from this general rule of Section 43A in case the Government is satisfied that it is the necessity and it is in the interest of:A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court while dealing with the statutory framework regarding data breaches in a proceeding for quashing of FIR in Amit Kumar Jaduan v State of UP and others examined Sections 43, 47 and 66 of the Act. The important observations made by the court in the present case are summarised hereunder:The point to note is that the problem in availing of these remedies in law is that in most cases of data breaches, the main culprit, i.e. the hacker, is not known or is a professional hacker who will be operating remotely out of international territories. Thus, instituting proceedings in these cases may not result in any actual gain to the victim of the crime but in many such cases, there will be an entity which failed to protect user data. In cases like these, the company that failed to do so becomes the party in question. This is why the reporting of these data breaches is of vital importance. There is no provision in the Act that mandates reporting data breaches. This drawback has been sought to be fixed in the Personal Data Protection Bill of 2019, but that is yet to be finalised and brought into law. It is, therefore, desirable that India finalises and enacts the data protection law at the earliest to patch these lacunas in the current statutory framework. References: the sovereignty or integrity of India,defence of India,security of the State,friendly relations with foreign States orpublic order orfor preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above orfor investigation of any offenceThe person who is owner or a person-in-charge of the computer, computer system or computer network against whom the act of default has been committed should not have consented for the act of default.There must be some damage or loss arising out of the act of the defendant to the person so affected.The difference between Section 43 and 66 is that the pre-requisite of the latter is the existence of mens rea, while under Section 43 of the Act, it is whether the Act committed includes the consent of the owner or person who is in charge of the computer, computer network, or computer system or not.Simultaneous actions can be maintained under Section 43 and 66 because of lack of provision which bars the same.While the jurisdiction of civil courts is barred for offences related to Section 43 and there is a special court in the form of an adjudicating authority under the Act to try offences under Chapter IX of the Act, there is no special court created for offences prescribed under chapter XI which consists of Sections 65 to 74 related to offences. Regular criminal courts will have the jurisdiction depending on their power to adjudicate depending upon the quantum of punishment prescribed in the Code of Criminal Procedure.https://www.mondaq.com/india/data-protection/655034/data-protection-laws-in-india–everything-you-must-knowhttps://www.barandbench.com/columns/the-vulnerability-of-data-a-look-at-data-breaches-and-the-statutory-framework-in-indiahttps://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=e7b6cb3b-f534-45ba-b1fb-86d7ed39e558https://cio.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/government-policy/indias-first-data-protection-bill-the-road-ahead/72833120"

    "headline": "CONCEPT OF NATURAL JUSTICE IN INDIADO WE REALLY NEED SEDITION LAWS IN INDIA?CRIME AGAINST WOMENBreaking Stereotype: Right to Equality is for All",
    "data": "This article is written by Nandini Srivastava of Manipal University Jaipur. This article is curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.The concept of natural justice originates way back. In the bible, it is mentioned that when Adam and Eve ate the fruit of knowledge, the forbidden fruit then the god gave a fair chance to both of them to defend them before giving them any punishment.There are two principles of natural justice; one is Nemo judex in causa sua second is Audi alteram partem.This principle states that the deciding authority should be unbiased and impartial while deciding a case. Only a partial judge can make the best decision. This principle also contemplates that any man cannot be the adjudicating authority in his own case because then he might take a decision which is in his own favour. A human always tends to take decisions which benefit him because it is against human nature to do something which harms oneself. This is mentioned under Article 21 which states “No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law”. The court in the case of Kartar Singh v. State of Punjab[1] held that procedure under Article 21 refers to just, right and fair.This principle ensures that the public does not lose confidence over the legal system of the country.There are different types of bias and they are as follows:This is when the deciding authority has a relationship with either of the both parties involved in the dispute. The relationship can be of enmity, friendship, love or business. In any of the cases, the judgement delivered is prejudiced.In this case, the petitioner was granted a mining lease in 1947 for 99 years. In 1953, the Secretary of Revenue Board accused the petitioner of violating Section 10, 12 and 14 of the Mines Act, 1952 and issued a notice whereby stated that the petitioner has to submit within 15 days an appropriate reason as to why his license should not be cancelled.The petitioner denied all the allegations against him in his reply. However, the government quashed his license in response to which the petitioner brought a case against the minister who passed this order on behalf of the government. The petitioner stated that this decision was taken in the light of rivalry because he had not supported this government in 1952 elections. SC found this allegation to be true and thus, quashed the order passed by the minister.In this, the decision maker has financial or monetary interest in the matter of dispute. The amount of pecuniary benefit is not imperative; it can either be small or large.This is one vital case of pecuniary bias. A Public Company Limited filed a case against a landowner. The Lord Chancellor who decided this case was a shareholder of the company. He decided this case in favour of the company because of his monetary or financial interest. His decision was later quashed by the House of Lord.The Chief Justice reconstructed the bench when he became aware that one of the judges is the member of the co-operative which is involved in the dispute.This is when the deciding authority either directly or indirectly involved in the matter of dispute.This means that parties in dispute should be given a fair chance of being heard. Any judgement which is delivered by violating this principle shall be held unconstitutional. This principle is derived from Article 14 of the Constitution of India, 1949.The petitioner Maneka Gandhi’s passport was taken into legal custody without providing any opportunity to be heard on the ground of public interest. The court held this act to be unreasonable, oppressive and arbitrary.The components of fair hearing are as follows:A notice should be given to the parties involved in the dispute before conducting the hearing. This should be done so that the person concerned is aware about the allegations for which he has been charged beforehand and can prepare for the case. If a person is not given any information then the arrest or any action will be unlawful. This is mentioned under Article 22(1).In this case, the court pronounced that even if the statute expressly does not mention that notice should be given then also, it is compulsory to give notice.It is vital that the notice is clear, precise and straightforward. A person has the right to defend himself in a case against him and for that he has to be prepared. A person cannot be punished only for the charges mentioned in the notice and not otherwise.The individual should be given appropriately reasonable time to prepare for the case.Right to fair hearing also includes the right to cross examine. The definition of cross examination is mentioned under Section 137 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. It states:“The examinations of a witness by the adverse party shall be called his cross – examination.”The courts in India have also stated that under certain circumstances the right to cross examine will not be considered as violation of natural justice.The court held that in case any parties on its own denies to cross examine the other party then it cannot be held that violation of natural justice has taken place.In this, the male student accused of indecent behaviour was not given the chance of cross – examining the girl on the ground that this would lead to an embarrassment for the girl student.Every person has the right to have legal representation and this cannot be denied. This was reiterated in the case of A.K. Roy. [9] This right is mentioned under Article 22(2) of the Constitution. One of the Directive Principles of State Policy also supports this right. Article 39 A postulates:“The State shall secure that the operation of the legal system promotes justice, on a basis of equal opportunity, and shall, in particular, provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that opportunities for securing justice are not denied to any citizen by reason of economic or other disabilities.”The concept of natural justice is not explicitly mentioned in the Constitution yet it acts like a backbone of all the judicial, quasi- judicial, administrative and quasi – administrative actions. To ensure that authorities neither abuse their power or justice is miscarriage, this is vital.[1] (1994) 3 SCC 569[2] AIR 1960 SC 468[3] AIR 1965 SC 1096[4] AIR 1978 SC 597: (1978) 1 SCC 248[5] AIR 1961 SC 284[6] 1962 A.C. 322[7] 1990 (47) ELT[8] AIR 1973 SC 1260[9] AIR 1982 SC 710 Nemo judex in causa sua Personal biasMineral Development Corporation Limited v.

    "data": "This article is written by ‘Ritika Sharma’ from ‘Ansal University’, edited by Aaryaki Rana from Chanakya National Law University, Patna.A petition has been filed before the Hon’ble Supreme Court in July this year for deleting the words ‘secular’ and ‘socialist’ in the Preamble of the Constitution of India, which was added by the 42nd constitutional amendment.The three petitioners namely Balram Singh, Karunesh Kumar Shukla and Pravesh Kumar claimed to form a political party under this petition. However, according to Section 29- A (5) of Representation of People Act, 1951, it is mandatory for a political party to abide by the principle of socialism and secularism to register itself with the Election Commission of India and the petitioners do not subscribe to this idea. This petition filed through advocate Vishnu Shankar Jain has also challenged the insertion of words secular and socialist in Representation of People Act, 1951.The petition further argues that the constitution makers have also rejected the concept of secularism and socialism. They claim that the constitution makers never intended to add the concepts of socialist and secular . In fact, they intended to ensure that they will treat all subjects equally without any religious bias. The insertion of words secular and socialist in the preamble of constitution of India was rejected thrice after heated debates between the members of constitution assembly. Prof. K.T. Shah, a prominent member of the constitution assembly, proposed adding the words secular and socialist to the preamble thrice.It was on 15 November 1948 the proposal came from prof. K.T. Shah to incorporate the words secular, federal and socialist in article 1 of the constitution, but after a long discussion it was rejected by the constituent assembly. Again, on 25 November 1948, Prof. K.T. Shah for the second time introduced an amendment to incorporate the word secular in Article 40 of the draft constitution, however that was rejected too. The third attempt was made on 3rd December 1948 to incorporate the word secular, which also was set aside by the constituent assembly.Dr. Bhim Rao Ambedkar, the chairman of the drafting committee, opposed the amendment proposed by prof. K.T. Shah to add secular and socialist to the Preamble. The constitutional makers were aware that the communist theory could not last long in the Indian democracy. The plea states that the principles of secularism and socialism are part of political thoughts developed under the ideology of Karl Marx, a German philosopher, economist, historian, sociologist, political theorist, journalist and socialist revolutionary, which has been recognized by many countries. It further stated that the cultural and historical theme of the great republic of Bharat is based on the concept of Dharma, which is different from the other countries and also different from the religion and communist theory concept and therefore cannot be applied to Indian context.The petitioners demanded the Hon’ble Supreme Court to scrutinize this position, of how the Parliament could go against the declaration made by the Constituent Assembly, and add, subtract or amend the preamble of the constitution. It is because of the words secularism and socialism appearing in the Preamble, the political parties are bound by such notion, which is in violation of Article 19 (protection of certain rights regarding freedom of speech, etc.) and Article 25 (freedom of conscience and free profession, practice, and propagation of religion) of the Constitution. The petition therefore asks the apex court to examine the roots of secularism and socialism.The question laid before the Hon’ble Supreme is whether the Preamble can be constructed as a provision of the Constitution, and whether the 42nd amendment is ultra vires? And, also Whether section 29- A (5) of the representation of people act, 1951 is violative of article 19 (1) (a), (c) and article 25 of the constitution of India?The petitioners argued that there are provisions in the Indian constitution which are made in favour of minority communities, in the form of state grants to aid minority religious institutions, and also the state has, although limited, power to regulate and amend laws relating to religious matters. However, according to the foreign sought concept of a secular state, a state cannot have the power to make law on economic, financial, political and any activity of any religion. In view of the provision contained in Article 19 (1) (a) (c) and Article 25 of the constitution, every citizen has the right to speech and expression and to form association and unions and also practice the religion of their choice. This means they cannot be compelled to follow the principles of socialism and secularism and therefore it is challenged whether the political parties and the public in general are bound to follow the principle of socialism and secularism."

    "data": "This article is written by “Meghna Jalali” from “Ansal University and curated by Sahana Arya”.It has been just about four months since the first reported COVID-19 case, and the entire world has met up to fight what is probably the greatest danger our species has faced in the last century. And remember, we are discussing a century that has seen two universal wars! With uncommon measures being taken at the network, organisational, government, and individual levels to slow down the advancement of the sickness while an antibody is discovered, we end up living in a new normal.The mobile workforce is one of the few paradigm-shifts, alongside social and social change, that while as of now being authorized, is scheduled to turn into the new ordinary in a post-COVID world. While there are a great deal of reviews discussing the points of interest and the business and mechanical part of this huge undertaking, I might want to utilize this article to address the human part of the condition.While Remote working is instantly going to be the new normal, associations will battle in this new method of execution in the event that they can’t move the workplace excessively far off. Organization culture impacts each part of any association, and that is no different in the case of remote work. Being aware of this while setting out on a distributed team model is a great first step to avoiding the impact of remote working on company culture.ADVANTAGES OF WORK FROM HOME:If few worries related with work from home can be reduced, it might turn into a standard much after the limitations due to COVID-19 are lifted basically in light of the fact that work from home has numerous points of interest for both, bosses just as workers, for example,ADVANTAGES TO CUSTOMERS: The cost spared by IT administration associations through Remote Working could likewise go to the customers and this would make them increasingly serious and cost-effective on the cost of services provided.UPGRADED FLEXIBILITY ON WORK SCHEDULES:Remote working assists representatives with arranging their work routines as per their family requirements and that causes them to strike an ideal work-life balance. They have the adaptability to change their work hours and take breaks freely to deal with their social and home obligations. This adaptability permits them to invest more energy with their friends and family.REDUCED STRESS:There are interesting studies that suggest that long drives and horrific peak hour traffic will in general sap away the energy out of representatives and cause a ton of stress. This has a falling impact on their concentration at work and the time spent with family, when they are back home. Work from home extras them from this anguishBASIC TOOLS FOR REMOTE WORKING:While Remote Working offers various favourable circumstances to all the partners in question, the associations need to guarantee that suitable tools, that coordinate their way of life, are made accessible to its representatives and administrators to safeguard the workplace culture and make the most out of working. There are a plenty of instruments out there – recorded under a not many that won’t just upgrade the Remote Workers’ proficiency however will likewise improve the procedure to oversee them, keeping them profitable, adjusted to organization culture and qualities and developing expertly:WORRIES RELATED WITH WORK FROM HOME:The two main worries that the IT and business leaders are still carrying in Work from home environment are:-DANGER OF DATA BREACH IN WORK FROM HOME ENVIRONMENT:Work from home condition is denied by edge security controls which is an essential cleanliness of the association’s system. In spite of the fact that most associations have provided food for VPN and so on for a safe availability of end-focuses with the workers/applications on premise or on cloud, the nonattendance of border security in work from home condition builds probability of information essentially. The accompanying dangers are at upgraded level in work from home condition:Information Theft: A review uncovers that over 47% workers remove information before leaving their association. Work from home will give an monitored and ‘safe’ condition to duplicate the official information to representatives for some time later.Misrepresentation: There have been numerous occurrences when workers have passed touchy data to pariahs for their monetary profit. In work from home condition this hazard will be a genuine concern.CONCLUSION:The current circumstance has demonstrated that ventures are ready to experience a noteworthy social change close by computerized change. While associations need to give the correct advancements, assets, and rules to their representatives to assist them with adjusting to the new circumstance, it is likewise the obligation of each individual worker to remain positive, hopeful, and dependable, and utilize a portion of the additional time for personal development while additionally keeping up exclusive expectations of effectiveness and efficiency at work.In the meantime, we are additionally prone to see the development of new programming and working models to take into account the special difficulties of a work-from-home economy. It won’t be long until better instruments to encourage gatherings and shared conversations with partners and clients, track profitability and productivity, and drive learning at both individual and group levels, rise and are quickly embraced by associations in an offer to change for this new typical. My recommendation in this circumstance would be to anticipate change, yet in addition to grasp it.Savings on real estate cost (Employers), on transport cost (workers) and on fuel (Government)Saving of commute time of workersBetter work-life parity of employeesProfitability enhancement due to flexibility of work.Unstable Internet connectivity and mobile networkDanger of Data Breach"

    "data": "This article is written by Shubhangi of ILS Law College Pune and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.“What keeps me going are my learnings, which I would rather call my ‘experience,’ and my urge to explore.”–Sushant Singh RajputSushant Singh Rajput was born on 21st January 1986, in village Maldiha of Purnia District, Bihar to Krishna Kumar Singh and Usha Singh. After his mother’s demise in 2002, he was devastated. In the same year, his family moved from Patna to Delhi. Sushant academically was a brilliant child and had scored rank 7 in the DCE entrance examination, and was also a National Olympiad winner in physics. He got admitted to Delhi Technological University and started pursuing engineering but he got attracted to dance. Then he enrolled himself in Shiamak dance classes and after that into Barry John’s drama classes and that’s when he realized his passion for acting and career in Bollywood. Sushant found out that he could connect with people and could do acting forever and after that, he dropped out of engineering.He started his career in 2008 with the debut in serial ‘Kis Desh Mein Hai Mera Dil’ and later in 2009 he got the lead role in Zee Tv’s serial ‘Pavitra Rishta’ which was a popular serial back then. Then he made his debut in Bollywood in 2013 in ‘Kai Po Che’ for which he received the nomination of ‘Filmfare Award for Best Male Debut’. Then he bagged many other movies in Bollywood. His most appreciated movie was ‘M.S. Dhoni: The Untold Story’ in 2016 and later ‘Chichore’ in 2019 was also liked by the audience. Sushant was active in social causes through funding NGOs to provide education to the weaker section of society. But then one-day things turned upside down.On 14 June 2020, Sushant Singh Rajput committed suicide at his house in Bandra by hanging himself from the ceiling fan. At the time of his death, it was found that he was suffering from depression and was consulting a psychiatrist. It was reported by various newspapers that Sushant Singh Rajput showed traits of clinical depression and medical papers along with antidepressant pills were found at his residence. The investigation began to check for foul play as no suicide note was found. His autopsy was conducted by a team of 3 doctors whose reports indicated the cause of death as ‘Asphyxia due to hanging’. So, chances of foul play were cleared. Even his viscera reports were analyzed which also ruled out foul play.Initially, there was no FIR filed but on July 25 Sushant’s father K.K. Singh filed a FIR. against actress Rhea Chakraborty for abetting the suicide of late actor Sushant Singh Rajput who was his current girlfriend. There were rumours of them getting married. Late actor’s father accused Rhea Chakraborty of draining Sushant financially and compelled him to keep a distance from his family. She was further charged with ‘Money Laundering’. The FIR was filed in Rajiv Nagar Police Station, Patna. To date police have enquired about 40 people regarding his sudden demise yet there is no success in finding what made him take this drastic step. The FIR further alleged that Rhea Chakraborty forced Sushant to end his life and also threatened him to not reveal details about his mental illness to the media.Four teams of Bihar police have left for Mumbai for further investigation into the FIR. Though Mumbai police have mentioned that initially, they had zero contact with Bihar police regarding the investigation on the FIR. Further P.I.L has been filed by Rhea in the Supreme court stating that she has no role to play in the actor’s demise and also to transfer the probe to Mumbai for an impartial investigation.There has been a demand for C.B.I investigation in this case by various people like Rhea Chakraborty had herself asked for C.B.I to look into this matter along with BJP Rajya Sabha MP Subramanian Swamy after talking to Bihar Chief Minister Nitesh Kumar who has also demanded a C.B.I inquiry. And for the same, a P.I.L was filed in the Supreme Court seeking C.B.I to take control in this case. The P.I.L was filed by one Alka Priya. This P.I.L was looked upon by the three Judge-Bench headed by Chief Justice of India Sharad Arvind Bobde and Justices A.S. Bopanna and V. Ramasubramanian. The bench said that Alka Priya has no locus standi in the case and Mumbai police are looking into the matter and they can always approach Bombay High Court for seeking relief. Even Maharashtra’s Home Minister has mentioned that ‘the Mumbai police is competent enough to handle such cases. Currently, the case is probed by both Mumbai as well as Bihar police.Sushant Singh Rajput was a great actor as he hid all his pain behind his smile. His death left the whole nation in shock and dismay. After his death, various issues came into the light like nepotism and groupism that various self-made actors feel in the industry. As star kids get roles easily and an outsider has to struggle to even get a side role. Even after being talented, they have to suffer to a great extent to make themselves noticeable in Bollywood. Even Kangana Ranaut and her team in a video talked about how nepotism is deep-rooted in industry and how it affects the lives of struggling actors. She also blamed Dharma Productions and Yash Raj Films as a reason for the demise of the late actor. His death also raised questions about mental health problems. We can only survive if we as a nation take mental health seriously in these inhumane conditions. We need to keep ourselves mentally strong and composed if we want to achieve our goals happily in our life. Good mental health gives us hope to survive any condition gracefully."

    "headline": "REFORMING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN INDIA: PRINCIPLE-BASED SOLUTIONSIMPORTANT JUDGEMENTS 2016BCI not to grant affiliation to any new law colleges for next three yearsChanges after the Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35A",
    "data": "This article is written by Bhavya Verma of JEMTEC, School of law, and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.India is a country with one of the largest legal peripheries in the world. Since ages, the judicial system in the country has been following ideals based on the processes being carried on by the members of this field. A lot of people and great jurists disagree that the present judicial process in India needs urgent reforms. But, the need and consideration for these reforms have never been taken into prominence until now, when the entire country is trying to make its way out of the COVID 19 pandemic which has affected many human lives and has also brought in many socio-economic changes in the state.There is an ideal system wherein the innocent is absolved and the guilty is punished. But the way this system is brought into action is the biggest doubt which arises after clearly watching the drawbacks that exist in the system.There have been ways observed by a few great jurists as to how the judicial process in India can be brought back to its utmost dignity. Provided, it is given full importance by every member involved in this field and avoid corrupting this system of justice.A few such ways observed are as follows:In the well-known case of Nambi Narayan, a scientist working for the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) had been falsely accused of leaking information and technical details of a project that was based on India’s effort on building cryogenic rocket engines. Along with Nambi Narayan, a few other scientists had also been accused. He was made to spend 50 days in jail. He also stated on his acquittal that he was tortured too during his conviction. The ACBI investigation cleared him of the charges imposed on him 4 years after his acquittal. The National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) had also ordered the State Government of Kerala to make a compensation of 1 crore rupees to Nambi Narayan. That has not happened as yet.CONCLUSIONAll of such factors mentioned above can be a great move in uplifting the judicial sanctity of the state. People of various sectors of the society have given up on the way the judicial system functions in the state. Mostly because of the reason that many of them have not been served justice over years of yearning, waiting, and making visits to the courts. All of these aspects would only get better if people unite to work towards bringing a collective improvement in the Judiciary of the nation and bring about strictness in the administration of these improvements if ever made. Reduction in Hierarchical System- This system can be described as the distinction made between the types of courts prevalent in the Indian Judiciary. This system began to prevail when the courts were started to be described as lower or higher. Similarly, the distinctions are also made between the advocates of such courts. This divide creates a difference between respecting these institutions altogether and by calling district courts and magistrates the “lower” judiciary, grave disservice is done to their role and importance in justice delivery. The use of terminology steeped in the hierarchy should be discontinued. After all, the courts, more than any other institution, will be aware of the expressive power of language. Promoting Restorative Justice for regulatory or technical offenses-This is an approach wherein the focus lies on giving time and tasks for self-improvisation to a criminal booked for minor offenses that include imprisonment of up to 2 years. This is more of an identified alternative to imprisonment, Need for better investigation-There have been several cases wherein the people at the much bottom rungs of social power in the society have been falsely accused and have been convicted and account for the bulk of undertrials. Most of these people are tribal people, Muslims, or Dalits. Increasing the use of digitalization and technology- This is the emergent need of the judicial process. In this entire period that was struck by the COVID 19 pandemic, the cases that were held in the court were having virtual hearings and such a process should not be used just as a temporary measure but should be brought into prominence in handling cases for the future as well. The Bar and the Bench should deem such use of technology in the judicial system as a long-term solution to problems that exist in the judicial system, mostly getting over with the cases which are pending and racked up in courts. This shall also require the Bar to accept the emergence of digitalization technology and prepare all its members to deal with the same. Cutting down judicial delays-The solution to deal with the huge backlog of cases is not simply to increase the number of judges, judicial employees, or fill vacancies, but to come up with more innovative and progressive solutions such as creating new courts of appeal and fast track courts. This should be taken up as a mission under the leadership of the Chief Justice of India so that the judicial system in the country should not only be known for the eloquence of its substantive judgments, but also for its aptness to deliver justice quickly, independently and in a manner that keeps the belief of the people of the state intact."

    "data": "This Article is written by Simran from Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan and curated by Dheepika R from ICFAI Law School, Hyderabad.Web accessibility is crucial in our new era of social distancing as it covers almost every sphere of life. Humanity never before has faced such digital dependence to access the information but today most of our daily routine revolves around social media as with communities all over the world not sure as to how long they will be homebound, people are increasingly headed towards online classes (virtual classes), shopping, alerts, information, entertainment. A little known but most concerning condition is millions of people with disabilities in India are struggling to use websites that most of us take for granted. We need to think about disabled people who are in special need of assistance when it comes to shopping in brick and mortar shopping as they are excluded from gaining access to websites and social media platforms concerning the public at large and obligations by international. Below is a wide-ranging analysis of this situation.The Ministry of Statistics and Program Implementation, also known as NSO performed a survey on disabled people within the space of six months starting from July to December. After the research had been done its outcome shows that the population of disabled people in India is Around 29,700,000 with a frequent rate of 2.2 percent.Moreover, many persons with disabilities rely upon the regular home delivery of necessary items like medication, food, and hygiene products also. Therefore, in addition to the adverse impact of social distancing and support networks, if retailers and service providers do not ensure the accessibility of their online information it may put at risk on their lives due to lack of access to vital information. For most people accessibility is limited to the immediate physical environment but contrary accessibility should entail the digital world and mainly include various components like online documents, websites, apps, online broadcasts, and other communication platforms and devices. However, not everyone can access the series of new information and developments and many programs like “Start-up-India” and “Digital India”. These programs raise the digital economy in the country, but a considerable part of the economy still lacks access to the digital world.The Rights of Persons with Disabilities Rules (2017) and The Rights Of persons with Disabilities Act (2016), it is mainly established to help disabled individuals access websites.Background of the Law:According to Section 42 of Right to persons with disabilities Act, 2016, the government is responsible forUnder the rule 15 of rules, to ensure the information and communication technology are accessible some specific requirements are stated in agreement with section 42 and according to rule 25 every establishment must act according to the requirements:On 1st October 2017 Convention on the Right of Persons with Disabilities was ratified. The main aim of Disabled law is to safeguard people with disabilities from every kind of segregation, biased, and discriminatory behavior and also to promote proper accessibility and opportunity equality among every citizen. In 2012, a study of ten government websites was conducted for promotion of employment for disabled people and a barrier break. So the results came out that web accessibility guidelines are not followed by main and affiliated websites. Several millions of disabled individuals are not able to access and enjoy the same privilege which other people are transacting online.Case Law:In one of the famous cases named Jeeja Ghosh v. Union of India, the Supreme Court said the immediate shift in disability discourages charity and medical models. Although people with disabilities are now considered as the subject with rights granted to persons under the Right of Persons with Disabilities Act, 1995 which formed human rights in themselves as human rights are considered as the fundamental rights or legal rights.Status quo and the way forward:Despite the government standing on its ground regarding the use of Aarogya Setu and the NGOs and activists stating that the contact-tracing app for COVID-19 is not usable for the disabled, the app remains inaccessible to people with disabilities.Considering that section 24(1) of the Act explains that one of the government’s crucial economic capacities is to ensure the realization of the disabled’s rights, this uncertain fear of the unexpected remains a real thing. According to Section 20(2), the government is responsible for providing reasonable accommodation at workplaces, aside from private bodies.Nevertheless, Assam has actively and progressively played its role in disseminating information in an accessible format for the disabled, which is a commendable move. After assessing the websites that hold releases about the curfew, it is believed that the adopted interface remains inaccessible for a specific group of people with hearing impairment, low-vision, mental illness, muscular dystrophy, learning disabilities, and leprosy cured individuals. Ensuring that every content in electronic, print and audio media are accessible and,Ensure that electronic media are accessible to the disabled individuals by offering sign language interpretation, audio description and close capturing and,Ensuring that universal design is used for providing digital equipment and techniques for the daily used necessities.Requirement no. 1is that According to instructions for Indian government websites, the websites must follow some rules and regulations specified in the Department of Administrative Reforms and Public Grievances.Requirement No. 2is that Electronic Publication based pdf must be permissible format for uploading any document."

He shall only be exempted from this punishment if it is proved that he had reason to believe that the marriage is not a child marriage.Section 6 prescribes that if a minor enters into a marriage then the person in charge of the minor whether parent or guardian or anyone else either lawful or unlawful will be prosecuted if he promotes permits or negligently fails to prevent the marriage from being solemnized. He shall be given simple imprisonment which may extend to three months and will also be liable to pay fine. Unless proven otherwise it will be believed that the concerned person has carelessly failed to prevent the marriage. No women shall be prosecuted and punished.This Act was later repealed.Prohibition of Child Marriage Act, 2006Section 3 states that every marriage solemnized before or after the commencement of this Act shall be held voidable at the choice of one of the parties to the marriage. Petition for annulment can be filed by either of the parties once they have attained majority or by the guardian or next friend along with the Prohibition Officer if the petitioner is a minor. The major has to file this petition before completing 2 years. The court, in this situation will order both the parties to return any valuables, money, ornaments or gifts received by the other party or money congruent to that.Section 4 of these Act mentions that the District Court might give an order to the male contracting party and if he is a minor then to his parent or guardian to provide maintenance to the female contracting party till she is remarried. Maintenance can either be given on a monthly basis or once and for all. If the petition of the annulment has been filed by the female party then she also has to be provided residence by the other party till her remarriage.Section 9 contemplates that a male who is above 18 years old but less than 21 if contracts a child marriage shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment which might extend to 2 years or will have to pay fine up to 1 lakh Rupees or both.Section 10 states that anyone who directs, promotes, abets or performs a child marriage shall be given rigorous imprisonment which can be extended up to 2 years and shall be liable to pay fine up to 1 lakh. The person will be punished unless it is proved that he had reason to believe that the said marriage is not a child marriage.Section 11 mentions that if a child contracts a marriage then the parent, guardian or any other person who has authority over the child either lawfully or unlawfully along with the person of an organization or association who does an act promoting, permitting the marriage or negligently fails to prevent the solemnization of the marriage will be punished with rigorous imprisonment extending 2 years and will be liable to pay fine extending to 1 lakh. In the same manner, the people who attended or participated in this marriage will be punished. No women will be punished.Section 12 induces the circumstance under which the marriage will be held void. The circumstances are:Despite various laws that has been enacted and repealed and then enacted, the evil practice of child marriage is still prevalent in India. The very imperative reasons for this are as follows:Many people advocating against the child marriage comment that it kills various opportunities for the children who in turn hampers the growth as well as development of the child. All the people fail to realise that this practise most importantly hampers the innocence, capability, dreams, aspirations and hope of the child which is more important than the country. As I firmly believe “Logo se hai yeh desh, yeh desh se nahi hai log”.Child marriage was first abolished in India in 1929 yet this practice still exists in our country. Thousands of legal frameworks can be enacted and implemented but this issue will not end. It will only end through educational awareness. Once, the people realize that all the genders are equally wise, strong and capable this problem will no longer exist. When the minor is forced or deceived to go to a particular placeSold for the purpose of marriage or if the minor is married and then sold, trafficked or used for immoral purposesIs taken from or convinced to leave the lawful guardianPoverty- In a poor family, where the family is quite big it is often considered better to get the daughter married so that the economic burden of the household could be reduced and the available resources could be directed towards the welfare of the other children. Many people still consider daughters to be a “Prayadhan” who will only serve her marital home. Therefore, instead of educating and providing resources to her they spend on their sons who will take care of them when they grow old.Security- Many people believe unmarried girls are at more risk of exploitation. They could be harassed, rape, abused, eve – teased by the other men. If a girl falls victim of any one of this then it is comprehended that she will bring shame and dishonor to the family. Therefore, in order to protect their reputation they get their daughters married at an early age.Traditional beliefs- Many people are of the opinion that getting a daughter married at a young age is holy.All the reasons above might be different yet its foundation is gender based discrimination. It propounds the ideology of the Indian society that men have higher status than women. Child marriage not only deprives the child of the better opportunities but also make them vulnerable to many other problems. Like early pregnancy, high mortality rate, high risk of getting HIV positive, inability to do proper family planning and notably the stress on both the parties to the marriage."

    "headline": "The Social Peril of Honour KillingIS YOUR PRIVATE VEHICLE A PUBLIC PLACE? -LAW HAS DIFFERENT ANSWERSAADHAR CARD NOT MANDATORY FOR THE REGISTRATION OF MARRIAGEAn Overview on Anti- Hijacking Act",
    "data": "This article is written by Ritika Sharma from Ansal University and curated by Aaryaki Rana from Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Honour killing is commonly identified as killing of a family member, most commonly a girl or a woman for bringing shame or dishonour to the family because of the woman eloping or due to engaging in inter- caste marriage, among many. It is also called customary killing which means killing done in order to comply with the custom of culture.In India, honour killing takes place mainly due to two reasons: if a person marries outside his/ her caste or religion or marries without family’s consent. Although, the cases of honour killing are prevalent all over India but more incidences are common in Punjab, Haryana and Uttar Pradesh. Marital infidelity, pre -marital sex, inter- caste marriage, inter- religious marriage, attempt to obtain divorce, or refusal to enter into an arranged marriage are some of the main reasons of honour killing.Honour killing has been prevalent since ancient times. In Ramayana, Ravan’s sister Surpnakha secretly married Vidyutjivah- a Danava prince. On marrying a Danava, Ravan became angry with Surpnakha because Danava were mortal enemies of Rakshasas. In order to maintain his respect, Ravan killed Vidyutjivah.Violation of lawsIndian constitution is the basic and supreme document which lays down the rights and duties of citizens. Honour killing violates some of the provision of the constitution. It violates article 14 (right to equality); article 15(1) & (3) (prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of religion, race, caste, sex or place of birth); article 19 (freedom of speech and expression); article 21 (right to life and personal liberty). Honour killing also opposes some of the national legislations listed below:Why is it still prevalent?“Honour” has always been linked with the women of the family in India. Men are considered to be the head of the family who monitor the activity of each family member. Every decision has to be taken after consulting the male member of the family, particularly when it comes to women. This shows the patriarchal mindset of modern society. Men are allowed to be out late hours, take up night shifts’ jobs or even hang out with their choice of peers. But women are still forbidden from doing so. The way women dress, marries, everything is related to “honour” of the family. When people will start respecting the choices made by the women, their will, their decision, this practice of honour killing will come to an end. Nirupama Pathak’s case of 2010 is one of the leading case law in honour killing which grabbed the attention of many viewers both in national and international media. She was a 22 year old journalist, who was killed by her family because she was found pregnant and was planning to marry a person outside her caste.Caste system has turned out to be an unending curse for India. Despite these alarming incidents , people’s views towards the caste system have not changed. In another case, the Nitish Katara murder case, a Sessions court Judge held and ridiculed Neelam Katara, mother of Nitish Katara, whose son was killed by the sons of politician DP Yadav because of his involvement with his daughter, that how can his son’s murder amount to honour killing as in honour killing daughters are killed and also her son was from an upper caste. It is wrong to distinguish the dominant class as good and the oppressed class as bad.Lack of education and awareness among the people about their rights and the unavailability of punishments for such people is also one of the reasons for the expansion honour killing. To think and believe in a system which still distinguishes between a dominant caste as respectable and the oppressed class as unworthy is a sad reality of our country. Until now the society has considered honour killing as the only solution to get rid of any problems related to women. Honour killing has a bad impact not only on the family members of victims but also the society at large. The siblings of the victims may be scarred and be afraid of engaging in any act, which ultimately results in obstructing their growth. Families therefore maintain a strict vigilance on their children. Mainly the girl child of the victim family has to suffer. It results in an increased number of suicides cases. It is certain that honour killing has done more harm than good to people. In this 21st century, if the child at the age of 18 years has the right to vote and to elect his representative, this tells us that he/she is psychologically able and competent enough to take the decisions for his/her own life. This act of mercilessly killing is definitely not the solution to this problem. Inter caste marriage, refusal to enter into an arranged marriage etc. does not snatch away one’s right to life. It is a shame that till today there is no definition for honour killing or honour crimes. The only probable and effective solution to this social evil is government intervention through stringent laws to curb the menace of honour killing. But above all , it becomes our duty as a society to educate such orthodox families and support such shunned off individuals, so that they live in this society with peace and dignity.Special marriage act, 1954: this act allows marriages which are performed irrespective of caste or religion. But the practice of honour killing is contradictory to this act.Protection of human rights (amendment) act, 2006: this act protects the human rights of every individual. Despite thisact, practise of honour killing takes away the life of people and obstructs their freedom of choice of marriage. Hence, resulting in violation of humanDomestic violence act, 2005: This act provides women the right to prevent marriage if it amounts to any abuse to women. Here again, honour killing results in infringement of this act."

    "data": "This article is written by Simran from Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan, and curated by Dheepika R from ICFAI Law School, Hyderabad.IntroductionLok Adalat is also known as “People of the Court” or People’s Court and is one of the systems of alternative dispute redressal mechanisms that are developed in India. It is the forum where cases are pending in the court of law or at a pre-litigation stage which is duly settled by the mediator amicably or by compromise by one party. Lok Adalat is based on the principle of Mahatma Gandhi. It is a judicial setup whose purpose is to peaceful resolution of disputes between litigation parties.Origin of Lok Adalat The concept of Lok Adalat was pushed back unconsciously in the last few centuries before independence and now this concept has again rejuvenated. It has become famous and popular among litigants. As far as in Indian legal history, this system has deep roots. The first Lok Adalat was commenced on March 14, 1982, at Junagadh in Gujarat. Maharashtra commenced the Lok Nyayalaya in 1984. Lok Adalat has been given statutory status under the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 following to the Constitutional mandate in Article 39-A of the Constitution of India which contains various provisions for the settlement of disputes through Lok Adalat to secure that the execution of the legal system promotes justice based on equality and equal opportunity to every section of the society.Article 39A of the Constitution provides that State shall secure that the accomplishment of the legal system promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunity, and provide free legal aid, by suitable legislation or schemes or in any other way, to ensure that the opportunities for securing justice which is not denied to any citizen because of economic or other disability.Article 14 and 22(1) also make it mandatory for the state to ensure equality before the law and equal protection of law to every person and a legal system that promotes justice on a basis of equal opportunity to all. Legal aid strives to ensure that the constitutional pledge is fulfilled in its letter and spirit and equal justice is made available to the poor, downtrodden, and weaker sections of the society. So, the evolution of this movement was a part to relieve the heavy burden on courts with pending cases to give relief to litigants also.Permanent Lok Adalats Parliament brought certain amendments to the Legal Services Authorities Act, 1987 to institutionalize Lok Adalats by making them permanent bodies to settle the disputes related to Public Utility Services. Public Utility Services mainly include Transport service, Postal, telegraph or telephone services, Supply of power, light and water to the public, System of public conservancy or sanitation, Insurance services, and other services that are notified by the Central or State Governments. Permanent Lok Adalats have the same powers that are indulged in the Lok Adalats.Jurisdiction of Lok Adalats To determine and to arrive at the compromise or to settle the dispute between the parties there is some jurisdiction of Lok Adalat in respect of any case pending before the court, any matter which is falling under that particular jurisdiction and which is not brought before, any court for which the Lok Adalat is established or organized.Powers of Lok AdalatEvery Lok Adalat organized for an area shall consist of 1.Sitting/ retired judicial officer which is also known as Chairman and two members who are lawyers and social workers. Lok Adalat minimizes expenses of litigation, saves valuable time of parties and witnesses, and also facilitates settlement to the satisfaction of parties.Lok Adalats have the competence to deal with several cases like: Advantages of Lok Adalats It mainly helps in speedy justice by reducing the workload of courts and the backlog of the disputed cases and also helps in unburdening the courts. As stated, it is economical and maintains cordial relations since the main thrust is on compromise, not punishment. Award is final without any appeal and fast and inexpensive remedy with legal status also provided.Conclusion This Lok Adalat mainly focuses on compromise and if it reaches an award is made which is binding on the parties. It is enforced as a decree on parties. Award is final and cannot be appealed because it is judgmental based. The Lok Adalat shall have the powers of a civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure.Power to summon, examine, and enforce the attendance of witnesses and also to take the evidence of the case.Power for determination of any dispute coming before this court by specifying its procedure.Power of requisitioning of any document or public record or copy from any court.Power to enforce the production and find out any document.Matrimonial caseUnpaid loan casesFamily Dispute CasesAll damage CasesMotor Accident CasesCase of Unpaid BillLand acquisition CasesPartition suitsMoney DisputesCompoundable civil, revenue and criminal casesArrears of retirement benefits cases"

    "data": "This article is written by Muskaan Bangani from Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan and curated by Dheepika R from ICFAI Law School, Hyderabad.Introduction:The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 was enacted to protect the consumers from the unfair trade practices in India and also promote speedy justice, inexpensive redressal of grievances with effective administration and settlement of consumers’ disputes in India. It is observed that the advertisements showcased by the firms are often misleading which results in convincing the consumer to buy those products which are harmful to their health. So, these wrong, fake, or misleading advertisements result in the consumer spending the money on these goods. Not only misleading advertisements, but the dealers also do not give a receipt for the purchase of the goods, in this situation the aggrieved consumers can join together and file a complaint to the authority as a class action and then, the authority can take appropriate action against the dealer and stop their unfair trade practice. Advertisements of any products are mostly done by renowned celebrities as there might be an agreement between the manufacturer and the endorsing person. The consumer buys the goods on the trust that the endorse person might have tested and used the product. But later on, the manufacturer changes or amend the product after endorsement.Consumers should always be aware of their rights, the rights are as follows:Rights to Protection/Safety:The consumer must be aware of the knowledge of the product he is buying to assure that the product is good for health and free of creating any environmental hazard. The consumers should be educated about the various types of hazards and problems associated with the advertisement of a product. The manufacturer or trader must give the best quality goods. In respect of services, they should ensure that the norms are followed. Hotels, restaurants are responsible for your safety and Banks are also responsible for any fraud and your money should be safe in your account and for any misuse of fraud or ATM and vice versa. You can always demand your safety of goods and services.Right to be informed:The consumers have the right to be informed of the goods and services that are delivered by the seller. It is the responsibility of manufacturers, dealer’s and traders to inform the consumers in respect of, what is the batch number, expiry date, packing date, ingredients, the hallmark, ISI mark, etc. which shows the standard is maintained by the manufacturer or producer. In respect of home appliances information concerning who is the manufacturer, what is the period of warranty or guarantee given by the manufacturer, and what is the cost. In any educational institute, there should be a separate inquiry office or prospectus with full information about the subjects, about the institute, and the fee structure. In airports or Railway stations, there will be board displayed or an inquiry counter will be there and the consumer will get all the information about the arrival, delay, cancellation, or departure. If information is not available, the consumer has a right to get the information from the concerned department, authority, institute, and other places.Right to Choose:The consumer has the freedom to choose from a variety of products at different prices according to their income.Right to be Heard:The Consumer has a right to file a complaint and to be heard in case of dissatisfaction concerning a good or a service. Business firms have also set up their consumer service and grievance cells to resolve the customer’s issue.Right to seek redressal:The Consumer has a right to get relief in case the product or service that fails to fulfill the expectation of the consumer. The reliefs can be in the form of replacement, removal of defects in the product, compensation, etc.Right to Consumer Awareness:A consumer should take an initiative to get the information about goods to be purchased. The Consumer has a right to acquire knowledge and to be well informed. Our Constitution provides for Directive Principles of State policy where the Government provides for the welfare of the people. In education level/courses the consumer protection rights/act is taught in all the schools, degree courses, etc. In the institution level whether government or non-government, workshops, education of the consumer protection act is there. The Government has its department/Ministry of Consumer Affairs which is running lots of awareness programs like Jago grahak Jago in media and there is a toll-free number for consumer complaints too and in Centre, for Consumer Research various courses and workshops are there on consumers’ protection. The consumer is also responsible to be aware and go for the correct scheme and not to be cheated.Online shopping fraud:There have been a lot of online shopping frauds in India. A lot of e-stores like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, etc. have either delivered fake or at few instances doesn’t deliver the product to the customers. I am citing a few instances in this context.Rahul Saini, a resident from Mumbai had ordered iPhone X from Amazon. When he opened his parcel, he found soap bars instead of iPhone X. Later, he complained at the consumer forum and he received compensation.In another case of Sheetal Das from Uttar Pradesh she had ordered original Adidas shoes from Flipkart, she received fake Adidas shoes instead.Another case of Abhishek Kumar resident of Delhi who had ordered a set of formals from Snapdeal, instead she received an empty box filled with plastic wrappers.Conclusion:A consumer must always be aware of his rights and duties. One must ensure that the goods/service he purchases is of sound quality and if he/she is denied right, they should not get deterred. In fact, they should knock the doors of Courts to restore their rights. Irrespective of the mode of shopping, there is always an agency that ensures a consumer is not blindsided by the trader, in this case- Consumer Courts."

    "data": "This article is written by Samta Sharma from JIMS, School Of Law, Greater Noida, IPU and curated by Sahana Arya. Recently, the terminologies like ‘Right to strike’ and ‘fundamental rights’ have become a buzzword for citizens and politicians both. Originally the Indian Constitution is the most remarkable document which provides the citizens with necessary rights and privileges. It indeed preserves to contribute the value of human dignity and esteem both, however it must not be ignored that more powerful rights also holds more strict duties attached to it and if not followed properly or misused then it might result in an unpredicted situation. In India, right to protest is a fundamental right under article 19 of the Indian Constitution but here a divergence of question arises that do Indian Constitution also include ‘right to strike’ under it ?This article further explores the core value of ‘right to strike’ in the light of fundamental rights.Notably, the right to strike is part of a much broader picture as these not only include common people but it also encompasses the political & judiciary system and imposes pressure on them to influence their policies through social, economic and political pressure on them. According to the Cambridge Dictionary, “The principle of Strike is to refuse to continue working because of an argument with an employer about working conditions, pay levels, or job losses”.Right to strike is recognised globally but followed everywhere in a different way. In India, right to strike is only perceived to a limited extent sanctioned under the limits imputed by the law itself. It is not an absolute right under the constitution set up of India but it glide from fundamental right to form union (article 19 of the Constitution of India). Strike is an intrinsic part of wage bargaining in the economic market of India and therefore, the trade union act of 1926 for the first time implemented limited right to strike by legitimising some activities of a registered union of trade in furthering of a trade dispute which otherwise breach of common economic law and it was ultimately made a statutory right under §22 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. Consequently in India, right to strike is not a fundamental right and is a common relative right which can be worked out with due regard to the rights of others. Article 19 (10) (c) of the Constitution accord freedom to the citizens to form trade unions. But the right to strike is an auxiliary right and if not provided then the right to form union and trade will be futile and hollow. While identifying the object of IDA 1974, the Apex court said that, strike is a legal weapon provided to the workers and must be only used in case of any urgency.Since we all know that the judiciary plays a vital role in bringing a positive change to the damaged part of the society, similarly the right to strike has been explained finely by the different bench in their respective judgements. In the case law of ‘Crompton Greaves Ltd. v Its Workmen’, the Supreme Court held that the strike is a legal weapon provided to workers. Whether the strike is justified or not, it will be judged in the light of fact and circumstances of case.Insomuch as we all know that every other fundamental right is subject to rational restrictions, likewise it is also applied in the case of trade union formation, to give a call to the employees to move on strike and the state is having the right to impose reasonable restrictions on them. In the case of ‘All India Bank Employees Association v. I. T.’, the Supreme Court held that, the right to strike or declare blockade may be restricted or managed by authentic industrial legislations & the validity of such legislation would have to be tested first by different deliberations. Thus, the fundamental right only secures the right of labour unions to form associations but there is no as such fundamental right for strike is provided for that. Also, a strike is only valid if it does not ignore any of the provisions. The strike is unjustified and illegal if the purpose behind it is unreasonable and the provisions and conditions under Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 is not fulfilled.Provisions of valid strike under Industrial Dispute Act, 1947-In order to undertake a valid strike, there are certain important procedures provided by the Dispute Act. Section 22(1) of IDA lays down some prohibitions on the right to strike. It provides that no person who is an employee in public utility services shall move on strike in breach of contract:It is to be noticed that these provisions are not restricting any one from undertaking their right to strike but it only requires them to fulfil these conditions before going on a strike. Also, since the act doesn’t specifically mentions about who is allowed to move on a strike, therefore the provisions, according to the act are only applicable to public utility service only. However the definition of ‘strike’ under the act itself indicates that the striker must be the person employed in any of the industry.Thus, the right to strike might not be a straight or direct fundamental right but it has astonishingly handled & saved the strikers right by adding the right to form association & union under article 19 of the Indian Constitution. Furthermore the Industrial Dispute Act also holds the roots of the right by providing appropriate provisions & procedure to fulfil the objective of the strike.CONCLUSION:In a large democratic society like India with a huge number of industrial sectors, it was very much required to bring the right of strikers into light for the welfare of people engaged in such working areas.It is observed that right to strike is not a fundamental right in India and is a conditional right only considered when the pre-conditions are fulfilled by the employees. On the other hand, the Industrial Disputes Act has also very finely handled these strikes by limiting the strikers according to the act. In today’s world, every country of the globe, whether it is capitalist, socialist or democratic, it gives the right to strike to workers but in India the rights are only provided by concentrating on the peace of the country. If this right is misused as a weapon, it will create a threat to the production & economy in many ways. Today countries like India are dependent upon the foreign investment and such countries must safeguard their respective industrial laws to avoid misuse of right of strike.Therefore, the country has only provided the laws with certain limits and provisions under the act of Industrial Dispute, 1947.Without submitting any notice of strike within 6 weeks before it.Within 14 days of submitting such notice,Before the expiration date of strike mentioned in any such notice.During the pendency of any conciliation proceedings, it must be submitted before a conciliation officer and seven days after the conclusion of such proceedings."

    "data": "This article is written by “Ritika Sharma” from “Ansal University”. This article is curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna. Introduction Like humans, animals are also living beings and feel much like we do. Cases on animal cruelty and inhumanity towards them are on rise. In India millions of animals are killed either to feed the non- vegetarian population or medical or cosmetic experiment done on them. Animals play an important role in the ecosystem. Now- a- days camel slaughter has also become a very sensitive issue. Human beings depend greatly on camels in order to survive in adverse desert conditions. About 85 per cent of Indian camel population is found in Rajasthan. Population of camels also called the “ship of desert” and declared as the “state animal of Rajasthan” is gradually diminishing. Many reports have listed camels as critically endangered species. Threat to camels Since the 1990s camel populations have declined. Diseases, smuggling, and lack of policy failure are some of the reasons for dwindling camel populations. Other reason is after the ban on cows and buffalo’s slaughter, Muslim community is left only with goats to slaughter on Bakr Eid. Now activists are demanding the state to allow camel slaughter for Bakr Eid. There was a tradition of consuming camel meat during Bakra Eid. Due to this tradition camels are made to suffer a lot. Because of their size and structure, they are made to walk towards their destination with inadequate food and water. Telangana high court banned slaughtering and butchering of camels A PIL was filed by Dr. Shashikala Kopanati which alleged that the state authorities were not taking any measures to prevent slaughtering of camels and their illegal transport. Transportation of camels out of Rajasthan is prohibited by Rajasthan camel (prohibition of slaughter and regulation of temporary migration or export) act, 2015. Despite this act, many camels were illegally brought into the state of Telangana and were slaughtered for public consumption. Ms. Divya, who was the learned counsel for petitioner submits to court that there is a tradition of consuming camel meat during the period of Ramadan. Under Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1960, authorities are bound to protect the interest of camels. But they are not taking any action. On the other hand, Mr. Sanjeev Kumar, who was the learned counsel for the state submits to courts that concrete steps have been taken by the state for protection of camels. As transportation of camels is prohibited out of Rajasthan, they should not be brought into any state secretively. Also, assures that authorities will take concrete steps to inspect licensed and unlicensed slaughter houses in twin cities of Hyderabad & Secunderabad and the Ranga Reddy District. Decision of court The two- judge bench comprising chief justice Raghavendra Singh Chauhan and justice B. Vijaysen Reddy of Telangana high court ordered slaughtering of camels in the name of tradition is illegal. The bench issued notice to the state to keep an eye on slaughtering of camels. They directed state authorities to carry out inspection of licensed and unlicensed slaughter houses, to take action against those who are violating the laws and to prevent illegal killing of camels. It also directed publicize the fact that killing and transportation of camels is illegal activity. Conclusion There are many laws which lawmakers have made to safeguard animals but many citizens are not aware of such laws. For instance, It is a punishable offence to kill or harm any animal, including stray dogs, under section 428 and 429 of IPC. Article 51g of the constitution of India states that we should have compassion for all living creatures. Drug and cosmetics rules act, 1945 banned the cosmetic tests of animals. No animal can be slaughtered in any place other than a slaughterhouse. Monkeys cannot be displayed or owned and are protected by wildlife (protection) act, 1972. There is a fine of Rs.25000 or imprisonment up to three years or both for disturbing any animal at zoo or littering the zoo premise. Section 38J of wildlife (protection) act, 1972. While there are so many laws in India to protect animals, implementation of these laws remains a major issue. I think each state should have its own society to prevent cruelty to animals which should actively work on implementation of such laws. It should make people aware about the importance of safeguarding the animals and also about the penalties & punishments for cruelty to animals. Parents must educate their children to be kind to animals and respect them. If one witnesses animal abuse he should immediately report it. Reports of animal cruelty should be taken seriously. Like us animals too have the right to live freely without pain and sufferings. If nothing is done to protect them it might cost their extinction resulting in an imbalance in the ecosystem."

    "data": "This article is written by Bhavya Verma of JEMTEC, School of law, and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.The AOR (Advocate-on-record) system was followed in Patna High Court in 2009, even before section 30 of the Advocates Act came into force. Section 30 of the Advocates Act became law in 1961. AOR system puts additional qualifications and criteria on advocate, for example, the passing of AOR examination, minimum practice, local stipulations, etc. Only after the satisfaction of the said criteria, an advocate has the right to practice in the High Court. In the case of R. K. Anand v. Registrar, Delhi High Court, the court held that the High Courts may consider making rules on the subject of AORs on the pattern of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has the power to set its own AOR system under Article 145 of the Constitution of Indiạ.The right to practice of an advocate is recognized under section 30 of the Advocates Act which states that every advocate whose name is entered in the state roll is entitled as of right to practice through the territories to which the Act extends including the honorable Supreme Court of India and any tribunal.Section 2(a) of the Advocates Act, 1961 defines Advocate as one entered in any roll under the said act. Section 16 of the Act states that there shall be two classes of advocates, namely senior advocates and other advocates. Section 24 of the Act lays down the qualifications to be needed to be enrolled as an Advocate. Section 29 of the Act states that Advocates are the only recognized class of people eligible to practice law and is subjected to the provisions of the Act. Whereas, Section 32 of the Act gives power to a court to permit any person not enrolled as an advocate, to appear in a particular case. Section 34(1) empowers the High Court to lay down the conditions subject to which an advocate shall be permitted to practice in the High Court and subordinate courts. Section 49(1) (ah) empowers BCI for prescribing the conditions upon which a person shall be entitled to practice as an advocate in a court. Section 52 of the Act is a saving provision that nothing in the said act shall affect the powers of the honorable Supreme Court to make rules under Article 145 of the Constitution of India.In the case of Ex-Capt. Harish Uppal v. Union of India held that section 34 of the Advocates act empowers the High Courts to lay down the conditions on which an advocate shall be allowed to practice in the courts. Section 34 of the Act and Article 145 of the Constitution of India signifies there is no absolute right to practice is given to the advocates. Even if section 30 of the Act comes into force, the right to practice of the advocates will be subjected to those conditions laid by the BCI.If High Courts introduce the AOR system it will introduce a new class “advocates on record”. The use of the word “shall” in section 16 of the Act contemplates that it is a mandatory stipulation. Therefore, there cannot be another class Advocates and High Courts have no statutory authority to create a class of “advocates on record” apart from the classes mentioned under Section 16 of the said act. If the parliament intended to give such powers to the High Courts, they would have explicitly mentioned it as in the case of the Supreme Court. Under Section 34 of the Act, the High Courts can put conditions on the advocates practicing in the High Courts but not to impose stringent criteria like AOR system."

    "data": "This article is written by Shubhangi of ILS Law College and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.“Terrorism is a challenge to humanity.”We live in a society where humanity is the most cherished quality. If something challenges humanity then it is a matter of concern hence terrorism holds a crucial status for the survival of mankind. Terrorism is one of the most debated topics on the global platform. Terrorism due to its origin, expanse, and ideologies is undoubtedly a very complex issue. It gets further complicated when some states use it as a tool to achieve their political propaganda. With development, the impact and reach of terrorism have also increased to a greater level.India has been facing and combating terrorism since independence in one way or the other. India can be referred to as the ‘epicenter of global terrorism’. Though the international community woke up to the reality of global terror only after the 9/11 attack, which snatched the ground beneath everyone. Terrorism is a very serious topic because it not only seizes the fundamental rights of citizens but also endangers a country’s political as well as economic stability.India was awakened towards terrorism a long time back and has promulgated some policies and laws to tackle it. Initially, the acts related to terrorism were dealt with under the provisions of IPC, Indian Arms Act, and the Indian Explosives Act, etc. and for procedural aspects, the Criminal Procedure Code was followed. But over the years with frequent, intense, and geographically widespread acts of terror, the need for specific legislation dealing with terrorism increased. This gave rise to the first two anti-terrorism laws namely ‘Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention) Act 1985, 1987 (TADA)’ and ‘Prevention of Terrorism Act 2002 (POTA)’. The TADA Act’s third paragraph gives a very thorough definition of “terrorism”:“Whoever with intent to overawe the Government as by law established or to strike terror in the people or any section of the people or to alienate any section of the people or to adversely affect the harmony amongst different sections of the people does any act or thing by using bombs, dynamite or other explosive substances or inflammable substances or lethal weapons or poisons or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances (whether biological or otherwise) of a hazardous nature in such a manner as to cause, or as is likely to cause, death of, or injuries to, any person or persons or loss of, or damage to, or destruction of, property or disruption of any supplies or services essential to the life of the community, or detains any person and threatens to kill or injure such person to compel the Government or any other person to do or abstain from doing any act, commits a terrorist act.”But both of these acts were repealed in the year 1995 and 2004 respectively, because of a lack of political support and national will. After that, for 4 years the country didn’t have any specific legislation regarding the increasing terrorism activities. Some states also enacted few acts to deal with the problem of terrorism like Maharashtra launched the “Maharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act, 1999” known as ‘MCOCA’ to combat this problem of terror. This act provides state government with special powers of surveillance, relaxed evidentiary standards procedural safeguards, and prescribing additional criminal penalties, including the death penalty to convicts in various criminal and terrorist activities. This was followed by other states like Karnataka, Chandigarh, and Gujarat, etc. but was not able to get the central government’s approval because of some political issues.Another act that got importance was the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA). This law came into existence in 1967, when it was passed in Parliament for tackling problems of unlawful activities. Some provisions of this act were even included in POTA which was later repealed in 2004. The major amendment under this act was in 2008, where the definition of terrorism was included in section 15 of this act. Section 2(k) read with section 15 of the UAPA states that “terrorism must involve violence, which causes death, damage of property, disruption of the countries essential supplies, kidnapping or abduction of public functionary to disrupt the unity and sovereignty of India”. A further amendment in UAPA was done in 2013 which incorporated financial as well as economic offenses which helped in the prosecution of offenses that took place outside the country.Another important development in this field was the enactment of the National Investigation Agency Act 2008 (NIA) by the government of India. The NIA Act established the National Investigation Agency which exercised special powers to deal with offenses that challenged the sovereignty of the state. The jurisdiction of NIA extends over offenses enlisted under the UAPA, SAARC Convention (Suppression of Terrorism) Act of 1993, etc. The NIA could operate on only those cases where they were fully convinced that the act reported by the state police was according to the scheduled list. Along with this, special courts were established under the amendment in UAPA where only these kinds of offenses were handled. The provision for Special Courts was also incorporated in the NIA Act of 2008. Under the provisions of the NIA Act, 37 Special Courts were established (30 in different states and 7 in Union Territories).CONCLUSION:The acts of terror are horrific crimes which require special provisions to deal with them. The consequences of terrorism are horrendous. The transnational nature of terrorism and its rapid utilization of technology makes it a global threat. Hence it is high time for India to take important steps in the field of legislation for terrorism. Over decades we have given more importance to politics-related topics rather than terrorism and have always engaged in politics behind it. But now we have to get our acts together and start taking things seriously. Terrorism is a deep-rooted virus in our society that could vanish only by the vaccine in the form of stricter provisions and legislations and efforts of society as a whole. "

    "data": "This article is written by Pratha Waghmare, from University of Mumbai Law academy, Maharashtra and curated by Rajrishi RamaswamyFollowing allegations of misuse of personal information contained in the “Marriage Information” published by the Registration Department’s website, the Kerala government has issued a circular to stop the practice of uploading scanned copies of “planned marriage notices” submitted to the Undersecretaries. Although this part of the problem has been resolved, the larger part remains unresolved. Uploading of notifications has made it easier for “community groups” to misuse private information. But current laws do not prevent them to come to the registration offices and take a photo of the marriage notices published there and share them on social media.Applicants submit the “planned marriage note” with the marriage officer and contain very personal details such as their name, address, age, occupation, photos and signatures. Section 6 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 requires that the marriage officer maintain all these communications with his office records and immediately insert a true copy of each notice in the Book of Marriage Notices. This book will be open for inspection at any reasonable time, free of charge, to anyone wishing to inspect it. The law also requires the marriage office to publish each notice by placing a copy of it in a visible place in its office. If a party is not a permanent resident within the local boundaries of the marriage officer’s district, he must also send a copy of that notice to the district marriage officer within whose borders that party resides permanently and therefore to the marriage officer must put a copy somewhere visible in their office.Therefore, if uploading marriage notices violates privacy of applicants, will it not be violated when published in an office open to the public? It is quite surprising to know that the constitutional validity of Section 6 of the 1954 Act has not yet been questioned by anyone so far. Publication of the expected marriage noticeSection 6 of SMA is reproduced in its entirety below for easy reference:This provision probably was included to enable matrimonial officers to verify the validity of a marriage. Essential pre-requirements include: (a) neither party has a living spouse, (b) neither party is unable to provide valid consent due to (i) mental weaknesses or (ii) has a mental issue or cannot procreate children, © ages of man and woman are 21 and 18 above respectively and (d) they do not fall under a forbidden relationship.Interestingly, the marriage officer should conduct an investigation into the matter only if he receives an objection within thirty days. Objections raised to the wedding for any reason other than those mentioned above are irrelevant. Lack of consent from parents or relatives cannot be a reason for opposing a marriage under the SMA.Discrimination against couples between religionsIt is important to note that the Hindu Marriage Act and other personal laws relating to the solemnization of marriages do not meet the above requirements. To illustrate, a Hindu couple can solemnize their marriage without notice to any authority or public and register it later. This is the case with other personal laws. But for interreligious marriages, the law created an obstacle in the form of notices and publications. This is a clear violation of the doctrine of equality enshrined in Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which orders the state not to deny any person, equality before the Law or equal protection of Law. It can be said that classification of individuals into interreligious couples and couples of the same faith and the application of different criteria to solemnize their marriages is legitimate or reasonable. Religion has little to do when it comes to choosing an individual as a life partner.Breach of privacyOne of Justice D. Y. Chandrachud’s significant observation is that the privacy process must be considered before starting this discussion. According to him, privacy has both positive and negative content. Negative content prevents the state from committing an intrusion into a citizen’s life and personal freedom. Positive content imposes on the state the obligation to take all necessary measures to protect privacy of an individual. Therefore, the first question that needs to be addressed is whether the state intrudes on a citizen’s life and personal freedom by forcing the marriage officers to publish private details presented by people.The Supreme Court in Shakti Vahini vs. UoI has stated unequivocally that when two adults choose themselves as life partners, it is a manifestation of their choice which is recognized in Articles 19 and 21 of the Constitution. Also in Shafin Jahan vs. Asokan KM, the Court observed that laws can prescribe conditions for marriage but cannot affect individual choices protected under the Constitution.When an interreligious couple makes a request to the marriage officer, they expect them to respect their choice, obviously subject to compliance with conditions established by law. The Act requires matrimonial officers to publish the notices visible at some point in his office so that the public may object to him. If the goal of this requirement was to determine compliance with conditions, it was unnecessary to involve the public in the process. It would have been sufficient to authorize the marriage official to investigate the matter on his own or through his staff, in case he doubted that one of the parties did not comply with legal requirements. Another irony in the outline of the Act is that if no one opposes marriage, it does not require the marriage officer to conduct an investigation into it.Especially after the 2017 privacy ruling, Parliament should have revised this requirement for publication of marriage notices. The ruling made clear that the right to privacy also imposes an obligation on the State to take all necessary measures to protect the privacy of a person. But it is too much to expect a revision by the legislators. It is sad that publication of marriage notices on websites began in Kerala long after the nine-judge Bench passed the privacy ruling. But it is encouraging to note that they corrected the error when it was reported. Now it is the Central Government that must take the initiative to review the Act with regard to Section 6.Unjustified disclosure of marriage plansJustice S. Ravindra Bhat, when he was a judge in the Delhi High Court, noted in his 2009 judgment [Pranav Kumar Mishra v. Govt. from NCT.] “It should be noted that the special marriage law was enacted to allow a special form of marriage for any Indian citizen, professing different religions or wishing for a civilized form of marriage. Unjustified disclosure of the marriage plans of two authorized adults to solemnize it can, in certain situations, endanger the marriage itself and, in some cases, it may even endanger the life or physical integrity of one of the parties to the interference of the parents “.His observations on the “unjustified disclosure of marriage plans” are most significant in the times in which we live. Now it’s not just about interference from parents, but also from society. The advent of social media has taken the extent of interference to another level. Maybe because Section 6 was not contested and also because this sentence was issued long before the privacy judgment, the Judge did not consider the constitutionality of the provision which, in my opinion, is the issue with “unjustified disclosure of the marriage”.In conclusion, I firmly believe that Section 6 of the Special Marriage Act, 1954 is unconstitutional and violates right to privacy under Article 21 of the Constitution for couples who choose interreligious marriages to the extent that it requires publication of their personal information. It also violates Article 14 as it discriminates against interreligious couples in exercising their right to choose their lifetime partners. “Notices of marriage book and publication. (1) The marriage officer must keep all the notices referred to in section 5 with his office records and must also immediately insert a faithful copy of each notifi- cation in a book prescribed for this purpose. , will be called the Marriage Notice Book, and it will be open for inspection at any reasonable time, free of charge, by anyone who wishes to inspect it. (2) The marriage officer will have each notice published by placing a copy of the notice somewhere visible in his office. (3) When one of the parties to an intended marriage does not permanently reside within the local boundaries of the district of the Marriage Officer notified under section 5, the Marriage Officer will also arrange for it to be transmitted. A copy of this notice to the district marriage officer within whose borders that party resides permanently and that marriage officer must therefore send a copy to a prominent place in his office.”"

    "data": "This article is written by Muskaan Bangani of Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan and Curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater Noida.For decades, there exists the traditional rule of Caveat Emptor, ‘Let the buyer beware,’ in which the buyer had to take all the responsibility for all the goods and services in the case of defect or default. At present, this tradition has been reversed to Caveat Venditor, which means ‘Let the seller beware,’ where the burden is shifted to the seller. The Consumer Protection Act 2019 has repealed the Consumer Protection Act 1986. The Consumer Protection Act 2019 provides protection for consumers’ interests, mechanisms to settle consumer disputes, the establishment of a central consumer protection authority, and regulates product liability and misleading advertisements explicitly.While dealing with product transactions, one should always acknowledge the responsibility and accountability of buyers and sellers towards the products or services.The term product liability got recently added in the amended Consumer Protection Act 2019. The term is defined under section 2(34) of the Consumer Protection Act 2019 which states, “the responsibility of a product manufacturer or product seller, of any product or service, to compensate for any harm caused to a consumer by such defective product manufactured or sold or by deficiency in services relating thereto”.Section 2 (35), defines Product Liability Action as a complaint filed by a person before a District Commission or State Commission or National Commission.

    "data": "This article has been written by Himansu Batar, IMS Unison University, Dehradun and Curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater NoidaA person’s body is a private thing that they possess, and no one had the right to invade this privacy. Keeping this in mind, the amendment in IPC through the Criminal Law Amendment Act 2013 took a most necessary step of recognising and stalking sexual harassment and Voyeurism as a crime. The amendment not only recognises the physical or real-world conduct of such activities, but it recognises their electronic forms as well. While sexual harassment and stalking had always been topics of discussion, Voyeurism has not got much limelight. Voyeurism is the act of observing, capturing, or distributing the images of another person without their consent or knowledge, usually for sexual gratification. This constitutes a type of sexual harassment under sec.354(c) and describes the act as, “Viewing and/or capturing the image of a girl or woman going about her private acts, where she thinks that no one is watching her, is a crime. This includes a woman using a toilet, or who is undressed or in her underwear, or engaged in a sexual act.” Any other person at the behest of the perpetrator or distributing such image shall be punished on first conviction with the imprisonment of either description for a term not less than one year that may extend to three years, and shall also be liable for fine. It is punishable on a second or subsequent conviction with the imprisonment of any description for a term not to be imposed. The concept of Voyeurism started with the Information Technology Act 2000, in which, both men and women were covered, and the penalty was up to 3 years with a maximum fine of Rs. 2 lakhs. The Information Technology Act 2008 strengthens the concept of Voyeurism. With the incorporation of provisions like S. 66E, S. 67, S. 67A and S. 79, the act covers the prohibition of all activities like transmitting, recording, capturing, recording of obscenity, and capturing a Sexually explicit act.A tremendous rise in cybercrimes was seen because of the technological advancements and cyber law being a new field is not known by many people. Thousands of such cases are not filed in fear of getting a bad name. A terrifying, spine-chilling incident of Delhi rape case a.k.a. Nirbhaya Rape case took place in 2012. A wave of outrage spread throughout the nation and understanding the heinousness and brutality of the act; the Criminal law was amended based on the recommendations of Justice J S Verma Committee. Provisions related to sexual harassment voyeurism were added as a part of it.In April 2015, the concept of voyeurism again was touched upon, when Smriti Irani, the HRD Minister, spotted a hidden camera in one of Fab India store pointing towards trial rooms. She raised the alarm and then reported to the Jurisdictional police. The incident was covered widely. However, it is still not enough to create an awareness in the society regarding this heinous crime.We must understand that Voyeurism is not just an act that affects the society at large; instead, it is an act that grievously violates the fundamental rights of a person as guaranteed under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. After the case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd) vs Union of India, the incorporation of Right to privacy under Right to dignified life, where the person’s privacy is given excellent protection, the act of Voyeurism stands entirely against it.Previously, there was no clear definition and scope for ‘intrusion into privacy.’ The offence typically combines with other sorts of harassment or violence and is not considered as a separate offence. The provision of this section requires the criminal to possess the intention to insult a woman’s modesty. It might or might not be an act that physically endangers a person’s security; however, it causes mental trauma and fear to the victim. It is a blatant intrusion into the privacy of a person, where the stalker tries to ascertain relations with his victim without his consent. A person would expect that private space, for instance, his/her house, or an area where he/she can assume they are not being watched or observed. A fair presumption of privacy includes both public and private areas where the victim within reason is expected not to be detected while interacting in private activities like disrobing or sexual acts.An interesting case regarding Voyeurism was reported in Canada in February 2019 under the head R v. Jarvis, where a high school teacher without any direction from school or school board and without anyone’s knowledge recorded the students, especially, female students through a pen camera. The question before the Supreme court was how to interpret the meaning of “reasonable expectation of privacy”. The members of the Bench had the same conclusion stating that the recording violated the policy of the school board, questioning the relationship of trust between a teacher and a student. The videos targeted specific female students, often with a focus on their breasts. The students would never expect their school teacher to record in such a manner. They had a reasonable expectation of privacy that got infringed.Despite being new, the concept of voyeurism had a tremendous effect on the legal system of India, but it still has some flaws. The laws are more women centric as they are found more susceptible to such acts, but we cannot ignore the very fact that transgender people and males are susceptible to this crime too. There is a requirement to make such laws more gender-neutral for better results. Privacy, crime, and safety of people are intricately linked in any system. A vital part is the safety of citizens, their privacy, and private information. If a legal system does not protect the privacy of the body and information of its people, insecurity will prevail forever in such a systemReferences:Law relating to Electronic voyeurism in India: Eyes behind the mirror, Atin Kumar Das Assistant Professor in Law, Haldia Law College, West Bengal, India file:///C:/Users/s/Downloads/3-3-48-214.pdfhttps://www.soolegal.com/roar/voyeurism-concept-and-punishment-under-the-indian-penal-codehttp://www.legalserviceindia.com/legal/article-3010-voyeurism.htmlhttps://www.thenewsminute.com/article/smriti-irani-case-did-you-know-there-law-deals-specifically-voyeurism"

    "data": "This article has been written by Mansi Deore from University of Mumbai Law Academy, Mumbai and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.The term “adultery” refers to voluntary sexual relationship or intercourse of a married person with a person who is not their spouse. The actual legal definition of adultery varies from country to country and statute to statute. In many places, adultery is when a married woman has sexual intercourse or voluntary sexual intercourse with another person except her husband while in other places, adultery is when a woman has voluntary sexual intercourse with a third person without the consent of her husband. Now let us address what exactly is a conjugal relationship; a conjugal relationship is a relationship wherein two people live within a marriage or remain in marriage but never live together. It may also refer to a situation wherein two people remain in a marriage-like relationship but are not married and have not lived together for a minimum of a year. Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 says that if a man has sexual intercourse with another man’s wife without the consent of her husband, then he is guilty or punishable by the laws. In many cultures, adultery is equivalent to crime. According to Jewish, Islamic, Christian and Hindu traditions, adultery has been categorized as a crime. In India, the adultery offence is punishable under Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. In this section, only men can be punished if they engage in intercourse with the wife of another man without his consent. What is noteworthy and astounding here is the fact that men are punishable under this section; women are not punishable even as abettors.Many cases in history bear witness to women being treated as an abettor. In the case of Yusuf Abdul Aziz v. The State of Bombay (1954), it was held that the woman was treated as an abettor, and that the woman was handed over to the hands of the other person by her own husband. Here, it is clearly evident that the woman has been totally objectified by her own husband. In this case, the woman is not punishable even as an abettor. The Court held that this provision is saved under the clause (3) of Article 15 under the Indian Constitution which provides special provisions for the woman and child. A person engaging in sexual relations with the wife of another man cannot be charged as adultery if the husband of the wife so involved had given his consent for the same. In another case of Sowmithri Vishnu v. Union of India, the three grounds of challenges were presented in front of the Court. First, it was argued that Section 497 gives the right to the husband to bring an action upon the adulterer but does not give a right to the wife to prosecute the woman with whom her husband has committed adultery. Second, the Section does not give the wife whose husband has committed adultery the right to prosecute him and third, it is narrow in scope and does not cover cases in which the husband has been having sexual relationships with an unmarried woman.In twenty-nine foreign countries, the sexual or sex-marriage is officially legal, the names of some of the countries being Netherlands, Belgium, Canada, Spain, South Africa, Norway, Sweden, Argentina, Portugal, Iceland, Denmark, Brazil, New Zealand, etc. There are several other countries where adultery has been allowed officially as well as legally. A woman always stays focused on her own husband or keeps out an eye on extra-marital relations of her husband. Here, the women are treated as they are abettors; they are treated as victims of the offence of adultery as they were in love and affection with their husbands. Their husbands easily give them away to other people who offer them consideration or even offer to offer it. Subsequently, a provision was made that men should be restricted from having sexual relations with the wife(s) of another person(s). It was also pointed out that the provision restricts their extra-marital relations to unmarried women.Men are restricted from adultery because they take advantage of the love and affection of their wives. A woman, however, is not safe around her own husband, as she needs protection by law in case he tries to take advantage of her love and affection. Men always do not think about their wives and treat them as abettors which is indeed shameful. The woman who should be respected according to Hindu culture is getting raped today; she is getting offered to another man who is not her husband and who does not deserve her. There was a case a few years ago wherein a newly married girl was offered drinks by her husband which contained some toxic substances; the effect of which made her unconscious. She consumed it under the love and affection of her husband, and her husband allowed his friends to have sexual intercourse with his wife thereafter. To decode the judgment, the court has only decriminalised adultery. The Britishers saddled us with this colonial relic while enacting the Indian Penal Code in 1860 whereas they themselves had discarded adultery as a criminal offence in the year 1857 itself. Majority of the countries worldwide treat adultery only as ground for civil issues including divorce and it continues to be so in India too. "

    "data": "This article has been written by Simran from Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan and curated by Dheepika R from ICFAI Law School, Hyderabad. During the last weeks, the fight against COVID-19 has become the highest priority of more than 200 countries and territories affected by the spread of the disease, through which it is considered as one of the main threats to human mankind. The countries with non-equitable health systems will witness tremendous damage in their economies as well as in their progress in achieving Sustainable development goals. Nature has given us a shrewd message with COVID-19 and ongoing climate change, As, humankind has placed too much pressure on the natural resources with cataclysmic consequences. Transformative steps are needed to be taken to combat this of Climate changes and Covid 19. This Climate Change during Covid-19 pandemic, with over 10 million people affected and around 5 lakhs dead and still counting, represents irreversible threat to human societies and the planet exposed the inequalities and carved the living of social, economic and political structures. So, there is some connection between climate change and Covid-19 that affect the health of life and Planetary health. Here Planetary health means interdependence health of human civilization and the state of natural systems which work through judicial attention of the human system. In this planetary system humans play a vital role as it affects consumerism, pattern of production and consumption that’s why some scientists refer to the current geographic environment change to be human induced and has dominance on the ecosystems and earth’s change. There are nine Planetary boundaries that determine capacity of the earth system i.e. climate change, biodiversity loss, interference with nitrogen, ozone depletion, changes in land use, acidic ocean, chemical pollution, atmospheric aerosol loading, global freshwater use. If that boundary is crossed it may trigger dysfunctional of earth system. So human health and the health of our planet is interlinked because the civilization is dependent on human health and also helps natural resources. But with the degradation of natural resources in human history, both the health and that of our planet are in danger. As far as Health means a state of completely well-being socially, politically and mentally. It is not only related to absence of disease or infirmity but also related to enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of heath as it is the fundamental right of every human without distinction of race, caste, colour, gender, religion, social condition as embedded in the preamble of the constitution of WHO. Do Weather and climate change determine where COVID-19 occurs? No, there is no conclusive evidence either weather or the climate has a strong influence of transmission. There is one virus i.e. SARS-CoV-2 virus which causes Covid-19 to spread all over the regions of the world, from cold to dry. to hot and humid climates. This is mainly transmitted directly from person-to-person and respiratory droplets are produced when an infected person sneezes or coughs. It is also transmitted through close contact. People may be infected even by touching surfaces but this is not a major transmission route. However, this climate change indirectly affects the Covid-19 disease as environment determination of health and stress on the health system. Due to origination of infectious disease and most pandemics in wildlife human pressure on the natural environment may drive disease emergence. Air Pollution is the serious cause of risk for infection and effect to control transmission of Covid-19 led to reduce economic activities and temporarily improvements in air quality in some areas .This is just a short term environment benefits which is resulted from Covid-19 , it does not improve the problem of Air quality and climate completely . How does water scarcity affect infectious disease like Covid-19?Access to safe water, adequate water and proper sanitization is essential in the community of basic hygiene and reduces the transmission of Covid-19. Access to these services in health facilities is crucial to preventing infections, reducing the spread of antimicrobial resistance and providing quality care. There is a lack of basic water services as it is also one of the healthcare factors. Climate change further threatens the availability of water, production for use, personal hygiene including for infectious disease. Conclusion: Covid-19 pandemic is a Public Health Emergency which disrupts several communities. Climate change is also a health threat which gradually increases stress. Ensuring access to the environmental determinants of health, such as clean air, water and sanitation, safe and nutritious food, is an essential protection against all health risks. WHO estimates that avoidable environmental risks cause about a quarter of the global health burden. As we know inequality is a major barrier in ensuring health and well-being, especially for the most vulnerable societies. Social and economic inequality reduce the health risk, as these changes will be necessary for both poor as well rich countries so their role of public opinion plays an important part. Climate change and environment priorities can play an important role in preventing and mitigating health crises. The health of the planet and well-being of people are inextricable. After COVID-19, nothing will be the same. But life can be better. We can recognize what really counts in our lives : being safe and free. We should do what we can to stabilize our environment and to protect the natural resources i.e. our support system. For this we have to think how we can restore nature by living differently as this is the high time. Governments, businesses, the UN, international organizations, scientists and individual citizens need to unite as a single global community to safeguard people from avoidable risks. The Government must closely examine and think about the world post Covid-19 and prepare for what comes next. This action will protect our planet and can be part of our new world. It is clear, as the world grapples with many unknowns, the one thing that is known is that the health of the planet and those that inhabit it are closely linked. "

    "headline": "DOES CONCEPTION OF PREGNANCY POST TUBECTOMY COME UNDER THE ACT OF MEDICAL NEGLIGENCE?Sale of Obscene BooksDIGITALIZATION OF COURT PROCEEDINGS: – A NEW WAY TO INDIAN JUDICIARYDOES PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO ANIMALS ACT REALLY SERVE JUSTICE TO THE VICTIM?",
    "data": "This article is written by Ritika Sharma” from “Ansal University. This article has been curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.IntroductionThere were various methods used for birth control during ancient times but it was in the 20th century that safe and secure birth control methods became available. Allowing women to plan for their futures, become more self- reliant by having time to invest in their careers and to have more control over life, birth control plays an important role in women’s life. Among various methods available for birth control, tubectomy has become an increasingly prevalent method for female sterilization in India. It is also called as “tubal ligation” which means “getting your tubes” tied to prevent pregnancy. It is the process in which the fallopian tubes are blocked, sealed or severed, thereby preventing the egg released by the ovary from reaching the uterus. But it is not an absolute method of preventing pregnancy.Doctors performing the operation of tubectomy at the time of child delivery cannot be held liable for medical negligence for not advising the patient about the chances of conceiving in future, held by the Punjab and Haryana high court.Facts of the case After twenty- six years, the charge of medical negligence against the doctor was set aside by the Punjab and Haryana high court. In this case the plaintiff/ respondent was admitted to the clinic of appellant and gave birth to her fourth child through caesarean section. At the time of delivery, the appellant performed a tubectomy procedure after obtaining consent from the plaintiff/ respondent to prevent further pregnancy. Respondent was assured by the appellant that after the delivery she will never conceive in future. Thereafter, the plaintiff/ respondent was discharged from the clinic. However, after some time the plaintiff/ respondent still conceived pregnancy and gave birth to her 5th child. For this reason, the plaintiff/ respondent filed a suit against the appellant before the trial court. It was alleged that due to the medical negligence of appellant she conceived her 5th child. The decision of the trial court came in favour of the plaintiff/ respondent, and the appellate court also concurred with the findings of the trial court. Afterwards, the appellant filed an appeal before the hon’ble high court, challenging the decision of both the courts.Issue involvedThe issue involved in the above case was whether the appellant was held liable for medical negligence for not informing the chances of future pregnancy that could arise in spite of tubectomy surgery?Plaintiff/ respondent alleged that she gave her consent to perform the operation only on the persuasion of appellant. She also argued that if she was not assured by the appellant that she will not conceive in future, then she would have never given her consent to perform operation at the of delivery. Therefore, the respondent submitted that tubectomy was a failure and she conceived her 5th child due to appellant’s medical negligence. She asked for the damages of Rs. 1.5 lakhs from appellant.On the other hand, it was submitted by the appellant that it was necessary to conduct a caesarean section. She conducted the operation after obtaining the consent from plaintiff/ respondent husband and to prevent future pregnancy, tubectomy was also performed. This was done in the presence of Chief Anesthetic. She further submitted that it was very well informed to the husband of the respondent about the chances of future pregnancy and the operation was held successfully without any negligence. Decision of courtJustice Rekha Mittal observed that the counsel of respondent had not referred to any medical test, nor did it examine any expert, that it was not advisable to perform tubectomy procedure along with caesarean section. It was also observed that there was no evidence to prove that the chances of failure of sterilization were more than seven per cent when the tubectomy is performed with caesarean section. There was no proof that sterilization failed due to negligence of appellant. The high court took the reference of State of Punjab v. Shiv Ram & other’s case and relied on the observation of hon’ble supreme court. Finally, it was held that the operation was conducted properly by the appellant and there was no negligence on part of the appellant performing the operation. Suit of respondent/ plaintiff was dismissed leaving the parties to bear their own costs. Judgement passed by the trial and appellate court was set aside and the appeal was allowed.ConclusionIf one has a duty to perform, exercise reasonable care and incase breaches the duty either by act or omission, can be held liable for negligence. Doctors have certain duties to perform and the breach of duties amount to negligence. Doctors have a duty to obtain patient consent before performing any surgery. But medical science is not an exact science; results vary from person to person. A professional may be held liable for negligence either if he/ she does not possess the essential skill which he/ she is supposed to have possessed, or, if he/ she does not exercise or work with proficiency in particular case. In the above case the plaintiff has not alleged that the doctor who performed the tubectomy was not competent to perform the surgery. If the doctor is taking due care of the patient and conducting the operations successfully, he/ she cannot be held liable for negligence. "

    "headline": "LIFE IMPRISONMENT-AN ALTERNATIVE TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENTADVERSE POSSESSION: SWORD CUM SHIELDONLINE LEARNING AND VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 21-A OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTIONWHAT DOES A GDP NUMBER TELL US ABOUT THE FUTURE OF ECONOMY",
    "data": "This article is written by Muskaan Bangani of Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan and curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater Noida. Similar to the two sides of a coin, life imprisonment and capital punishment are the two options before a judge while deciding the fate of a criminal, concerning a heinous act of crime. Capital punishment is also known as death penalty or execution, wherein the judge orders to put an end to the life of the criminal by hanging him/her, by following the due process of law. Life imprisonment means a prison term for his/her entire life span. Capital punishment or life imprisonment – Which of them is better is a pertinent question, and hence, it has been a sensitive and delicate issue of debate for decades. ‘To err is human, but to forgive is divine’. No human being is flawless on this planet, and everyone tends to make some mistake at some point in their lifetime, either knowingly or unknowingly, that could be an offence or a crime in the eyes of the law. So, if a person in a position of authority, forgives a wrongdoer, it creates an opportunity for him to repent for his mistakes and undergo reform. Therefore, the State should allow criminals to reform themselves. It is a widespread belief that fear of death prevents criminals from committing crimes, and the death penalty leads to a positive influence in society. Therefore, the public favours it in the hope that such harsh punishments will act as deterrents and will reduce the crime rate.India is a democratic country that encourages the death penalty only in the “rarest of the rare case”. The Supreme Court ruled this in the case of Jagmohan Singh V. State of Uttar Pradesh 1979. Later, this ruling was upheld, in the case of Bachan Singh V. State of Punjab 1980. Due to ruling and final decision of the highest court, the fear of death in criminals has reduced manifold, and as a result, horrific crimes like murder and rape are carried out in the most brutal manner. The effect of such grisly crimes being committed frequently is that ordinary citizens support the death penalty. As per the recent report of the United Nations based on the project ‘Goal 16’ for sustainable development goals, life imprisonment is the world’s most used forms of punishment, mainly because most of the courts around the world believe in awarding life sentence to a criminal rather than capital punishment, as the very nature of the punishment is revocable. Hence, life imprisonment as a punishment is favoured among the courts of justice. Every citizen has the right to life, and in life imprisonment, the accused gets a chance to live and reform, and also has the option of keeping in touch with his/her loved ones who in turn motivate him/her to become a better person. A criminal who is awarded this sentence in the early stages of life, i.e. in his twenties will have an opportunity to recognize his blunder and take corrective action to improve his character or behaviour. There has always been a misconception amongst people that a criminal will always remain a criminal, and that he/she will not change no matter what. However, this mentality of the people should change because criminals are also humans, and it is a need to give them a chance to reform. Secondly, capital punishment is not supported because it does not serve the purpose of punishing the criminal and instead provides him within a tranquil escape from all his wrongdoings, through the simple as well as easy punishment of death.Furthermore, various legal researchers have also stated that life imprisonment without parole or remission is considered to be an equivalent punishment to capital punishment, which allows the state to punish the wrongdoer, without taking away the life of such criminal, who has committed a barbaric crime.It seems right to punish the wrongdoer with capital punishment, but do the means justify the end? If we are against murder, it would not be right to commit the act ourselves by condemning someone for doing it, because we are contradicting ourselves in this manner by supporting capital punishment. So, which is the better one; capital punishment or life imprisonment is still an important question. However, many would choose capital punishment, though one should always opine that it is better to lock someone away for the rest of his/her life rather than ending his/her very existence. In prison, they receive three square meals a day, and the food served is quite awful and hardly edible. They share their cells with other murderers, rapists, and child molesters. Would not this harsh life be a better justice, where they can repent all their life for the ghastly crime they committed? It is undoubtedly better than becoming a murderer by awarding them the death sentence. An eye for an eye would make the whole world blind "

    "headline": "DECRIMINALISATION OF ECONOMIC OFFENCES: OF CHEQUES AND BALANCESIMPORTANCE OF MEDICLAIM POLICY  (In reference to Advocates)BAIL NOT JAIL: Analysing The Arnab Goswami CaseSURROGACY LAWS IN INDIA",
    "data": "This article is written by Simran from Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan and curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater NoidaThe economic issue of the COVID-19 lockdown, due to the culmination of almost all commercial activity, is yet to be fully ascertained. With the ‘Unlock 1.0’ earlier this month, many restrictions have been imposed in some places as factories, offices, restaurants, and malls following some protocols earlier are allowed to open their doors. While the economic stimulus package has been previously announced, with an uncertainty of market sentiments being low, other measures were needed to be taken to prop-up the economy. The Union has initiated the process of decriminalization of minor offences that are currently punishable with a fine and imprisonment term. Concerning this, the Ministry of Finance had released its Statement of Reason (SOR). It sought opinions from stakeholders like state governments, UT Administration, Civil Society/ Non-Government Organizations (NGOs), academicians, public and private sector organizations, and the public proposals to amend 19 acts that criminalize economic offences by 27th of June, for instance, a bounced cheque. Statutes which are proposed to decriminalize: The finance minister has proposed to decriminalize offences dealing with the economic and financial affair, and the main aim is to make them compoundable offences. These include Negotiable Instruments act 1881, the Insurance Act 1938, NABARD Act 1981, RBI Act 1934, as well as some more recent legislations such as provisions of the Securities and Exchange Board of India Act 1992, Sections 26(1) and 26(4) of the Payment and Settlement Systems Act 2007, Section 29 of SARFAESI Act 2002, and Section 23 of the Factoring Regulation Act 2011.Notable, the amendment under S. 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 that makes a cheque bounce act a criminal offence is now being reclassified to a compoundable offence as the SOR specifies that mens rea and mala fide intent play a vital role in the imposition of criminal liability. Therefore, it is critical to assess the nature of non-compliance, i.e. fraud as compared to negligence or inadvertent omission and the essential Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (Amendment) Ordinance 2020. By this ordinance, the initiation of new insolvency proceedings has been suspended for a period of six months starting from 25th March 2020 (extendable to one year). The Finance Minister said that Criminal penalties, including imprisonment for minor offences, act as a disincentive. This is perceived as one of the significant reasons impacting business sentiment as well as hindering investments both from domestic and foreign investors. This becomes even more relevant in the post-COVID-19 response strategy to revive economic growth and improve the justice system so that, the business can be run with ease.Five key principles for reclassification:The Statement has suggested five key principles for the reclassification of criminal offences to compoundable offences. i.e. Benefits of decriminalization: Actions taken to decriminalize minor offences are expected to go a long way in improving the ease of doing business because the economic investors always have a fear of offence in mind. It helps the pendency of the cases and prisons to unclog the court system; therefore, the economic offences will be treated or considered as a civil offence so that investigation or mediation can take place. The scheme “Sabka Sath, Sabka Vikas and Sabka Vishwas” provides trust to economic investors as well as economic players and increases the investment.Does this mean that the Government effectively provide Jail-free-card to the defaulters?No, it does not, the Government is providing them special privileges in the world of commerce. Moreover, the interest of Debtors and the Creditors is also kept in mind and have to be balanced. If protection is extended only to Debtor, it would be unjust for the creditors as they also need funds to commence or to start their business. It will hamper the commercial validity of creditors.Therefore, it is necessary to boost the economy. Businesses should take precautions to get back on their feet, maintaining a balance between competing interest and practicality. Protecting only the debtors will swing the pendulum on one side and will lead to sudden increase in cases that will deteriorate the objective of the proposed SOR. Decrease in the burden on businesses and inspiring confidence among investors. Focus on economic growth and public interest. Government ensures that the nation should remain of paramount importance. Decrease in the burden on businesses and inspiring confidence among investors.Focus on economic growth and public interest.Government ensures that the nation should remain of paramount importance.Mala fide intent is punished while other less serious offences are compounded.Habitual nature of non-compliance."

    "headline": "PRICE REGULATION OF N -95 MASKSWho won the Presidential Election? How is a President Elected? What are the qualifications?Balancing Privacy & Security in the Digital AgeSC revives criminal conspiracy charges against Advani and other BJP leaders",
    "data": "This article is written by “Ritika Sharma” from “Ansal University” and curated by Himanshu Raj of CNLU Patna.The government has been taking several pre -exempted, timely and proactive measures for prevention, containment, and management of COVID- 19. Panic buying has resulted in depletion of stocks and exorbitant prices in the markets. Enough and more emphasis has been laid on the use of masks and hand sanitizers. From the world Health Organization (WHO), to countries around the world, including India, have actively promoted the use and benefit of N- 95 masks and hand sanitizers in battle against the virus. It is in fact mandatory to wear masks while stepping out in public.Wearing a mask has benefit in many ways; first, they can filter out the viral particles from the air as we inhale. This is especially true for high -grade protective gear, like N-95 masks used by Health Care workers and frontline COVID warriors, which block up to 95 percent of microbial particles, but obviously less for the looser fitting cloth or surgical masks available for everyday use. Still studies also show that multilayered cloth masks -using a combination of tightly woven fabrics, or containing a pocket for a filtering material – can offer protection against aerosolized droplets.Equally important, or perhaps more so, there’s a growing body of evidence that wearing masks protects others as well. That is, these face coverings help stop the viral particles that an infected person might be exhaling into the space around them, especially important with COVID – 19 because so many people don’t realize that they are infected. That raises the risk that supposedly healthy people, who think they have no need to wear a face mask, are actively spreading the virus.The Ministry of Health and Family Affairs has in fact, while notifying the guidelines on rational use of personal protective equipment, made the use of N-95 masks mandatory by all heath care workers in hospital settings. The move comes as panic buying by people resulted in stocks of masks and hand sanitizers disappearing from markets. They are being sold at exorbitant prices in areas where the supplies exist. However, talking particularly about N-95 masks, the government has failed to ensure the availability of these masks at reasonable and affordable prices. On March 13, 2020 the essential commodities order 2020 was notified by ministry of consumer affairs, government of India, and the following products were declared as essential commodities:Once a product is declared as an essential commodity, section 3 of essential commodities act empowers the central government to pass orders inter alia controlling production, supply, and distribution of said product. Order controlling prices can also be passed.On March 21, 2020, in exercise of these powers, the Ministry of Consumer Affairs fixed the price for 2ply & 3ply masks and hand sanitizers order 2020.In spite of being declared as essential commodities by the previous order on March 13, 2020, the prices of N-95 masks were conspicuously missing from this order.The national pharmaceutical pricing authority (NPPA), an attached office of the department of pharmaceuticals, ministry of chemical and fertilizers, came into picture from April 1, 2020. The NPPA is an independent Regulator for pricing of drugs and is tasked with the job to ensure availability and accessibility of medicine at affordable prices.However, with the effect from April 1, 2020, all medical devices including N-95 masks have been notified as drugs, vesting jurisdiction with NPPA to control their prices. The NPPA has issued a list of price reduction in N95 masks by four major producers namely; Venus safety and health, Magnum Health & Safety, Yash care Life Sciences and Joseph Leslie & co. seemingly some have lowered the price of their product.Seemingly, the list seeks to demonstrate that the makers of these masks reduced the cost of their products, some up to 47 percent, after NPPA issued an advisory on May21, 2020, to manufacturers, recommending them to voluntarily slash prices.It was issued after PIL’s were filed about exorbitant prices of N-95 masks and demands for price cap on these masks. Recently, the NPPA had informed the Bombay High court, through an affidavit, that capping the prices masks at this point of time might “disincentives domestic manufacturers” at a time when the masks are needed in great quantities. The affidavit mentioned that the government procures the largest chunk of N-95 masks directly from manufacturers/ importers/ suppliers at bulk rates and ex- factory prices while in another part it is stated that the price range of these masks in market in between Rs. 45 to Rs. 350.Speaking about NPPA’s reluctance to fix the prices of N-95 masks, a source close to the development said, “There are a limited number of manufacturers in the country and nearly 90 per cent of their production is procured by the government directly. If the government fixes the prices of N-95 masks, there are high possibilities that the market will witness a shortage of N-95 masks. And in that condition, if the country has to import, then for each mask, they will have to spend a minimum of two dollars, which will be much higher in comparison to these prices. Looking at the consumption demand it will not be a viable move”.But, as per guidelines issued by the Health Ministry on May 15, 2020, N-95 masks are also to be used in non- COVID areas of treatment such as ENT clinics, emergency rooms, eye clinics, labor rooms, ambulance transfer etc. this has increased the demand for these masks. Moreover, healthcare workers in these places will have to buy these masks from the retail market. Hence, ensuring that they get these masks at affordable and reasonable prices is imperative.However, earlier, there have been reports that despite price caps on 2-ply and 3- ply surgical masks; many pharmacist and chemist have been selling them at inflated prices, which may also have contributed to rising concerns about the prices of N-95 masks among the medical fraternity, healthcare workers and public health activists.For now, the NPPA has said that it hopes more manufacturers will cut their prices in larger public interest and informed that this situation will be closely monitored.

    "data": "This article is written by Bhavya Verma of JEMTEC, School of law, and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.Every right comes with its duties. Most powerful rights have more duties attached to them. Today, whether it is democratic, capitalist, socialist, give the workers the right to strike in every nation of the globe. But this right needs to be the last resort tool because if this right is misused it will create a problem in the industry’s production and financial income. That would ultimately have an impact on the country’s economy. In India, the right to protest is a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution. But the right to strike is not a fundamental right but a legal right, which was added in the 1947 Industrial Dispute Act with this right to constitutional limitation.The law here in India doesn’t expressly recognize the right to strike. For the first time, the Trade Union Act, 1926, provided for a restricted right to strike by legalizing certain activities of a registered trade union in support of a trade dispute that would otherwise violate common economic law. Nowadays a right to strike is recognized as a legitimate weapon of Trade Unions only to a limited extent permissible within the limits laid down by the law itself.The right to strike defined in the Indian constitution is not absolute but it derives from the fundamental right to form a union. Since every other fundamental right is subject to reasonable restrictions, it is also the case that trade unions are formed to call on the workers to strike, and the state can impose reasonable restrictions. In the All India Bank Employees Association v. I. T., the Supreme Court held, “the right to strike or right to declare lockout may be controlled or restricted by appropriate industrial legislation and the validity of such legislation would have to be tested not regarding the criteria laid down in clause (4) of Article 19 but by totally different considerations.”Section 22(1)(a) of the Industrial Dispute Act, 1947 states that in the event of a breach of contract, workers may go on strike provided the employer provides an advance notice within 6 weeks of such strike. It also includes government employees. In the statute, the said right is not granted freely. There are certain conditions, which only if satisfied can the workers go on strike. The right is a major tool in workers’ possession to pursue redress and protect their freedoms. So, the need was a tool for collective bargaining. As the Supreme Court has said, the basic goals of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 are good relations between employer and employee and collective bargaining.Article 19(1)(c) gives the right to form associations and trade unions. If there is no right to strike, then it would be meaningless to form associations. Then why is such a right given in the first place? Through the sequence of judicial decisions, the Indian judiciary stressed the legality or illegality of strike but did not place a prohibition on the right to strike. The Apex Court held that the membership of the trade union if sufficient can bargain. But then this bargaining power is significantly weakened when the workers are granted the right to strike.The International Labour Organization demands that the workers be granted the right to organize and collective bargaining. Although, there are no express provisions on the right to strike. Yet this right was highly regarded by the ILO Committee of Experts as crucial and an integral part of the right to organize. Nearly all of the concepts contained in these two conventions were adopted and supported by India excluding the right to strike. Universal Declaration of Human Rights, 1948 provides for the protection of workers’ interests. They have the right to join the alliances and trade unions. And the right to strike is a continuation of their constitutional privilege in forming an association. International Covenant of Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights, 1966 also provides for the recognition of the right to strike with the condition that it conforms with the law of the member states.Notice of strikeNotice of strike within six weeks before striking where lockout already exists is not necessary. In Mineral Miner Union vs. Kudremukh Iron Ore Co Ltd., it was held that Section 22 provisions are mandatory, and the date on which the workers proposed to strike should be specified in the notice. If the date of the strike stated in the strike notice expires in the meantime, the workmen must send a fresh notice. It may be noted that if a lock-out is already in existence and employees want to resort to strike, notice as otherwise required is not required. In Sadual textile Mills v. Their Workmen, certain workmen struck work as a protest against the lay-off and the transfer of some workmen from one shift to another without giving four days’ notice as required by standing order. A question arose as to whether the strike was justified on those grounds or not. The industrial tribunal replied affirmatively. Against this, a writ petition was preferred in the High Court of Rajasthan."

    "headline": "Are Contractual Workers Entitled to Benefits under The Maternity Benefit Act?Prof. N.R. MADHAVA MENON- Father of Modern Education in India.FIRs TO BE UPLOADED WITHIN 24 HOURS: SUPREME COURTImportant Judgement related to Appointment of District Judge",
    "data": "This article is written by Pratha Waghmare, BBA. LLB. (HONS.) from University of Mumbai Law academy, Maharastra and curated by Rajrishi Ramaswamy from Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad.The question in the title can be safely classified as one of the most pressing concerns among women working through an agency or contract. However, Section 2 (o) of the 1961 Maternity Benefits Act evidently eliminates apprehension, since it defines “woman” as employed women, directly or through any agency, for wages in any establishment.Therefore, the definition of woman under the law extends the benefits to all female workers, including those hired through an agency or contract.Following the recent amendment to the Maternity Benefits Act, i.e. the Maternity Benefits (Amendment) Act, 2016, stakeholders had raised several questions and one of them was whether the amending law that extended the Maternity Benefit to a 26-week period was applicable to employees or contract consultants. Subsequently, the Ministry of Labor and Employment issued a clarification on April 12, 2017, in which it was stated that, since there were no changes to Section 2 (o) of the 1961 Act, it was applicable to all women who work in any capacity, directly or through any agency, or contract or consultancy work.Another question that is often asked is whether maternity allowance law applies to women workers in the private sector.The answer is yes. The Act is also applicable to employees of the private sector, since the statute does not distinguish between a public or private entities and also since it establishes that “the Act is applicable to:Each establishment which is a factory, mine or plantation, including any government-owned establishment and any establishment where people are employed to exhibit equestrian, acrobatic and other shows;Each shop or establishment within the meaning of any law currently in force in relation to shops and establishments in a state, where ten or more people are employed or have been hired, on any day in the previous twelve months.” What is the eligibility for applying for maternity allowance?Section 5 (2) of the Act clearly states that a woman is entitled to maternity allowance if she has actually worked under an employer at an establishment, for a period of not less than 80 days in the twelve months immediately preceding the date of her expected delivery. Case Laws:Delhi Municipal Corporation vs. The workers (Muster Roll) and Another: The Apex Court held that the provisions of the Maternity Benefits Act, also authorize maternity leave to women who work occasionally or on the basis of daily wages and not only those who work regularly. The provisions of the Acton the matter, are fully in line with the Directive Principles of State Policy contained in Articles 39, 42 and 43.The Central Administrative Court (CAT) in a recent case of Anuradha Arya v. The Principal & Ors. categorically stated that paid maternity leave benefits cannot be denied to a designated employee and that they are entitled to maternity leave as provided under Section 5 of the Maternity Benefits Act, 1961. While issuing this order, CAT has relied on the Supreme Court ruling in the Delhi Municipal Corporation case.The CAT in the above case also observed that the nature of “maternity benefit” requested by the applicant in the present case, cannot be systematically affected or equated to any “other benefit” claimed by an ad-hoc employee. Granting maternity leave to an ad-hoc or regular employee should be treated differently.The High Court of Kerala in Rakhi P.V. & Ors. v. Kerala State and Anr. held that hired employees are also entitled to 180-day maternity leave. In this case, the petitioners made an application for maternity leave during the period of their employment and were denied a 180-day maternity leave, as indicated in the Maternity Allowance Act (amendment), 2016. The petitioner has argued that under the provisions of the Kerala Service Rules (KSR), as well as the provisions of the 1961 Maternity Benefits Act, every employee who works in any establishment is entitled to 180-day maternity leave.The main complaint of the state in denying signatories 26-week/180-day maternity leave was that female workers working on a contract on state-funded projects were entitled to 90-day maternity leave.The Court also made the following observations:That the signatories are also female employees who work on contractual basis for state-funded projects. The benefits of improved maternity leave for women workers are undoubtedly part of the social care legislation aimed at guaranteeing women equal opportunities in public employment; therefore, the State’s claim that employees hired under projects are entitled to a 90-day maternity leave period cannot be tolerated, as it would discriminate against women workers who do not participate in capacity-building projects on a contractual basis.That the inalienable obligations of motherhood should not and cannot be a reason for denying equal opportunities to female workers. This would be precisely the result of the limitation of maternity leave to female workers, regardless of the nature of their employment.That the state’s claim that the contractual appointment of signatories lasts only one year and that the granting of six-months of paid leave would also eliminate the benefit of the compromised project is not sustainable because the signatories are people who continue to serve the base for the subsequent extension of the contract.Therefore, from the above laws and court ruling, it is very clear that the Maternity Benefits Act is applicable to contract employees and does not discriminate between people who work on a contract and regular job..

    "headline": "COVID -19: Quarantine and your Legal RightsOn Policing In Pandemic, Mindless Arrests & Prison Overcrowding : Criminal Justice & Police Accountability ProjectGULMEHAR KAUR-ABVP ROW: A CONSTITUTIONAL GRADIENTAdvocates in India: Enrolment and Admission",
    "data": "The coronavirus continues to spread around the world and in such difficult times, we have grown familiar with hearing the word ‘quarantine’. What does this word mean? How has it been defined in the law? What are the Acts related to it? We will discuss all these aspects in the article.The word “quarantine”, which has been derived from the Italian word “quaranta giorni”, means 40 days. Evidence suggests that the practice of quarantine dates back to the 14th century, to save coastal cities from plague epidemics. Therefore, quarantine in legal terms can be defined as “the limitation of activity and / or separation of suspicious people from other people who are not ill or suspected of baggage, freight, containers, aircraft or transport facilities, freight and postal parcels in order to avoid the possible spread of infection or contamination”.Legislations related to Quarantine in IndiaA 123-year-old British colonial era law that was enacted to combat the bubonic plague epidemic that erupted in the state of Bombay at the time is the main central legislative framework for preventing the spread of epidemic diseases such as swine flu, cholera, malaria and dengue.Section 2 A of the Law authorizes the Union Government to take necessary measures and prescribe regulations for the treatment of dangerous epidemic diseases in the ports of entry and exit.Under section 2, the states have the power to take special measures to deal with the epidemic within their jurisdictions, therefore each state is convinced that at any point in time, if the State or any part of its territory is threatened with one outbreak of any dangerous epidemic disease and when it considers that the ordinary provisions of the law are insufficient for the purpose; all measures, including quarantine, can be taken to prevent the epidemic.Section 3 specifies that any person who disobeys any order under the 1897 Act must be held liable for a crime punishable under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and a person is liable in the event of a conviction, to be sentenced to prison for one month or a fine or both. According to Section 4 of the Act, no legal action or legal proceeding will be brought against any person or authority for anything done in good faith.This law has also been called “archaic”, as it places emphasis on quarantine, but does not mention various scientific methods of preventing epidemics, such as vaccination and public health response. As the Central Government has declared COVID-19 as a “notified disaster”, there is another law that comes into play: Disaster Management Act, 2005.Disaster as has been explained in Section 2 (a) means a catastrophe, accident, calamity or serious event in any area resulting from natural or man-made causes or from accident or neglect resulting in substantial loss of life or human suffering or harm and destruction of property or damage or degradation of the environment and it is of such nature or magnitude that goes beyond the ability to face the community of the area concerned.This law allows the government to access the “National Disaster Response Fund”. Using this fund, the government will be in a better position to finance medical facilities and be authorized to set up a range of agencies to manage the ongoing crisis.Section 10 (2) (1) of the Law allows the National Executive Committee to instruct the government. Regarding the measures they must take, it is also said that anyone who violates these containment measures will be prosecuted in accordance with the provisions of sections 51 to 60 of the Disaster Management Act of 2005, in addition to the lawsuits in section 188 of the IPC.This law is also used in the dissemination of false news; Section 52 of the law states that people who intentionally make false statements to obtain governmental benefits can be imprisoned for up to 2 years.Article 58 of the Law also states that if a company or entity commits a crime, the person who committed the charge at the time of the crime will be liable. This provision can also be used to ensure that workplaces allow employees to work from home or pay employees their wages. This bill was presented to recognize health as a fundamental human right and establishes that every citizen has the right to the highest possible level of health and well-being.It places obligations on the government to ensure health for all. Chapter 3 of this bill elaborates on the rights of medical care, including terminal care for all. However, it lacks the ethical framework for the protection of human rights during this epidemic. Reference can be made to the Mexican Public Health Emergency Response Law which clearly describes the individual civil rights of a person quarantined in the midst of a health emergency.Other Laws in IndiaIn these difficult times, it is our duty to take all reasonable precautions and most people are unaware of the laws under which they can be prosecuted for such actions dangerous to the health and safety of others.In our country, disobedience to the quarantine rule is punishable under Section 271 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, with the imprisonment of any description for a period that can extend to six months or with a fine or both. Failure to take the necessary precautions despite being aware of the possibility of spreading this infection or disease is punishable under sections 269 and 270 of the IPC. Pursuant to Section 269, anyone who performs unlawful or negligent acts and is aware of or has reason to believe that the infection can spread any life-threatening disease will be punished with imprisonment of one of the descriptions for up to six months, or with a fine and imprisonment.Under Section 270, anyone who commits a malicious act, and knows or has reason to believe that the infection can spread any potentially lethal disease, will be punished with the imprisonment of any description for a period that can be extended to two years, or, or both. Malignant neoplasm is characterized by highly virulent, infectious and potentially life-threatening diseases. Disobeying the rules prescribed for social removal, coughing or sneezing without covering the nose and mouth, not wearing masks in public, ignoring the rules of social isolation, lingering on the streets in groups, socializing without taking into account the prescribed rules, etc. are all offenses punishable under Section 270.There are also some laws that focus on putting visitors in quarantine, such as the Aircraft Act and the rules of Indian planes that authorize government-appointed health officials to control people entering the country from abroad. The agents can review the aircraft, its passengers and crews and can undergo medical tests. They must follow precautions related to the quarantine period, when there is a spread of an epidemic. Quarantine laws in other countriesIn 1824, the United States Supreme Court, through a historic ruling, recognized quarantine power as unlimited state power and according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), quarantine power is generally granted to states, countries and cities to protect public health. While analyzing British quarantine laws, the Parliament of England added the Health Protection Regulation, 2020, which according to Section 45R of the Public Health Act (Disease Control) of 1984, authorizes the police, public health and immigration officers to detain suspect people and quarantine them.During the investigation in North Korea, an official returning from Wuhan was reportedly executed for going to the public toilet in violation of his quarantine, and the country promised to “rule under military law”.ConclusionIt has been seen that there are various laws and regulations governing quarantine, but such legislations are inadequately framed since they have been derived from various combinations of laws such as the Epidemic Diseases Act of 1897, which has been labeled as “archaic” and such other laws which are silent on various quarantine and home quarantine mechanisms during the pandemic. Adequate guidelines must exist for the implementation of the quarantine and the establishments of Courts that can help manage these health disasters, and there must also be a set of rules for individual civil rights during this crisis. Therefore, we hope that after dealing with these crises, quarantine laws should be visited and made clearer and more intact so that public health can always be a priority.These are tough times. We must all understand the extent of the catastrophe that lies ahead if we do not take into account the precautionary measures ordered by the state. We must all follow the rules prescribed for hygiene, such as frequent hand washing, social removal, the use of masks, the use of disinfectants, the safe disposal of used fabrics, staying in the house, self-isolation during illness and reporting to medical care authorities immediately after the development of any symptoms. More than laws and regulations, it is public support that can help us curb this pandemic and go back to leading a lifestyle of normalcy (or is this the new normal?).

    "headline": "SURROGACY- AN UNDER-USED GIFTJUSTICE VIKRAAMJIT SEN: ADMINISTRATOR OF DDCA AS APPOINTED BY DELHI HCSOCIAL SECURITY IN INDIA DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC.Breaking Stereotype: Right to Equality is for All",
    "data": "This article is written by Mansi Vyas of University Five Year Law College, UOR, Jaipur and curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater Noida.What is Surrogacy?Surrogacy is a practice where one woman agrees to bear a child for another parent(s) and gives the child to the intended parent(s) after its birth.As far as this article is concerned, there are two types of surrogacy:Timeline of surrogacy in India2005: 2002 draft of the National Guidelines for the Accreditation was approved.2007: Supervision and Regulation of ART Clinics in India were approved.India, because of its cheap facilities and availability of resources, became internationally famous.2013: Surrogacy by foreign homosexuals (homosexuality in India was not then considered), and single parents were banned. 2015: Commercial surrogacy was banned in India.2016: Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill was introduced and passed by Lok Sabha. It was later lapsed because of adjournment sine die in parliament. 2019: The bill was reintroduced and passed by Lok Sabha.2020: Reformed version of the bill is approved by the Union Cabinet. Key features of Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill 2016: Changes in the reformed Bill:Suggestions to improve the BillAlso, the eligible age of being a single parent should be lessened to a sensible age.There should be a provision for the promotion of adoption in front of every parent who decides for surrogacy. People must know their options, and they must also know how beautifully they will contribute to the world by considering adoption.ConclusionNot having a child when one is aching to have one is undoubtedly a painful situation. Science has made sure to do its part by giving such people the gift of surrogacy; the law needs to complement it too. The new Bill is undoubtedly better than the previous one, but it still needs much updating. India should stop being an orthodox country with unjust beliefs. It is time to shape our laws in a just manner by keeping into consideration every citizen, regardless of her/his marital status, sex, gender, and sexuality. a) Altruistic surrogacy- It is the type of surrogacy in which the surrogate mother (one who bears the child) is not given monetary benefits except for the costs related to pregnancy and insurance for a reasonable period.b) Commercial surrogacy- 1. It is the type of surrogacy where the surrogate mother is given the above allowances and is compensated for carrying out the whole process. It is the way of trading the human embryo or trading surrogate motherhood.Commercial surrogacy banned; only altruistic surrogacy was made legal.Qualification of intended parents:A heterogeneous couple married for at least 5 years. Wife’s age should be 23-50 years. Husband’s age should be 26-50 years.They should not have a former biological, adopted, or surrogate child. Physically or mentally challenged children as well as the ones with fatal diseases are exception to such case.They should have certificate of essentiality and certificate of eligibility from appropriate authority (such authority will be appointed by the central and the state government).Qualification of a surrogate mother.Close relative of the intended parents.She should be 25-35 years old.She should have at least one biological child of her own.She should have never been a surrogate mother before.She should be physically and psychologically healthy for the process.Clinics must be registered under this Act to perform surrogacy. Surrogacy cannot be performed in any place except the registered clinics.All medical costs incurred during the process of pregnancy shall be paid by the intended parents. Also, the parents must provide an insurance covering 16 months to the surrogate mother.The child born should have the rights as same as naturally born child of the intended parents.Not only heterogeneous married couples, but also, widows and divorced women can have a surrogate child.The age of the widow and divorced women must be 35-45 years.The surrogate mother need not to be a “close” relative of the intended parents. She can be any “willing” women.Period of insurance provided to surrogate mother is increased from 16 months to 36 months.Regulation of surrogacy by-National Surrogacy Board at central level,State Surrogacy Board at state level, andAppropriate Authority in Union Territories.After decriminalizing Section 377 of IPC, the government wiped its hand off the main job. One of all the things that are left undone is- giving them their rights to have a surrogate child. The provision of allowing only a “heterogeneous” couple to have a surrogate child should be struck off.The period of marriage for an eligible couple should be reduced to a reasonable period because five years is, in all respects, an extended period for people who are eagerly waiting to be parents.The provision of allowing only divorced women and widows should be updated. The right to have a surrogate child should also be given to single women and single men (regardless of the fact that they are divorced or not, or that their ex-spouse is dead or not).The negativity with commercial surrogacy should be tossed out. The idea of compensating women forbearing one’s child is in no way unethical. It is just a practical approach to things. The fact that now any “willing” women can be surrogate mothers shows that having only “close” relatives to do the job does not work. At present, if a close relative cannot be a surrogate mother, then why would any other woman bear a child without getting paid for it. No one can deny the fact that such payment helps the needy women. The step of jettisoning the payment part makes the whole process harder. (For this point, commercial surrogacy refers to the first part of the above-given definition)Infidelity should not be a necessary criterion for bringing eligible to be an intended parent. There can be people who are not sterile, but for whatsoever reasons, they do not want to have a child “naturally.” India has a robust population of 138 crores as of now, why contribute to it?As per data of 2019, 8677 children (plus hundreds of children who are not added in the data) are available for adoption, and yet people go for surrogacy. India needs to understand that “Genes do not define family; it is built and maintained by love.” If there are already so many pure souls yearning for parents, then why should not one make them the priority?

    "headline": "Women in Constituent Assembly: In reference to the case of Hansa MehtaPOLITICAL CAREER OF KIREN RIJIJU (MINISTER OF LAW AND JUSTICE)INFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN INDIAIMPORTANT JUDGEMENTS 2016",
    "data": "This article has been written by Himansu Batar of IMS Unison University, Dehradun and curated by Naman Jain ofBennett University, Greater Noida.In the past decade, we have seen a rise in the Women empowerment movements across the world. This has led to some significant changes giving new hope, heights, and horizons for women to grow while creating some deviances commonly called ‘pseudo-feminists’ or ‘feminizing’ who did not understand the real concept of ‘feminism.’ India has to offer some great inspiring females that truly depict the real image of feminism. Most important of them are the ‘Founding mothers’ of our constitution. Even though they were not given the same limelight that the male members received, Women have played a significant role in the Independence of India, and the part continued to be of the same importance while drafting the Constitution of India which is the supreme book of law that governs our state today. These women were reformists, lawyers, suffragettes, freedom fighters, and politicians. Despite being only 15 in number, these women played a significant role in making the constitution we know today.As already mentioned, these women have not been in the limelight, and not much is known about their contribution to the constituent assembly; still, many of them left a notable mark with their works, and one such member was Hansa Jivraj Mehta, born on 3rd July in 1897 in Surat, Gujarat. Refusing a reserved seat, she took on the elections for the Bombay Legislative Council in 1937 as a general category candidate securing a victory, and till 1949, remained in power. During this time, Mehta got intimately involved with the All India Women’s Conference and became its president in 1946. During her presidency, she drafted the Indian Women’s Charter of Rights and Duties that demanded gender equality and civil rights for women. The year 1946 brought a golden opportunity for her, and she was offered to serve as a member of the United Nations sub-committee on the status of women. She was the vice-chair with Eleanor Roosevelt of the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights Committee. Hansa Jivraj Mehta got the credit to replace the phrase “All men are born free and equal” to “All human beings are born free and equal.” After strong participation in the freedom movement and the event of going to jail in this process, she also played a significant role in the framing of the Constitution of India. In the Assembly, she strongly argued in favour of women’s rights and intervened in debates on uniform civil code and reservation. She was the Member of Advisory Committee; of Sub-Committee on Fundamental Rights; and of Provincial Constitution Committee. She, along with Rajkumari Amrit Kaur, modelled the Indian Women’s Charter of Rights and Duties, and fought for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC). The issues that these women raised were of great significance and consisted of the following points: Not only this, but the women in the Constituent Assembly stood together against any special treatment or political status for women, and they see it as a wrong value entering the sphere of Women and their fight for true equality amongst genders in the society.The women representation in the legislature has always been a question for us. The percentage of women representation has been declining tremendously in the last decades. The present government, however, has given quite a significant representation of women in legislature, and not only that, but some of the most important ministries are now under the leadership of these prominent women. They are showing the world how efficient a woman can be in government mechanisms. We have to look into the lives of these eminent women and their ideologies to understand the true meaning of feminism and how to achieve it in today’s world. Let us remember these ‘founding mothers’ and thank them for their contribution in giving us the most important and fantastic enactment that is making our life wonderful, i.e., The Constitution of India.

    "headline": "MINIMUM WAGE: A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHTAmendments to Rape Laws after Nirbhaya CaseThe Social Peril of Honour KillingINFRINGEMENT OF COPYRIGHT IN INDIA",
    "data": "This article is written by Ritika Sharma from Ansal University and curated by Rajrishi Ramaswamy from Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad.Labourers and workers in India constitute a large portion of the population. Indian labour law refers to laws monitoring and regulating the condition of labour in India. Many debates and conferences take place to improve workers’ working conditions and create enough employment for them. Without any decent standards of work, Indian workers have to suffer a lot.A recently released government report shows a very distressing picture of the plight of Indian workers and laborers with most of them earning either less or half of the minimum accepted norms. The report, called ‘Periodic Labour Force Survey’ (PLFS), is based on the survey of one lakh households carried out by National Statistical Office (NSO), under the Ministry of Statistics, Government of India.According to the Seventh Pay Commission, the minimum wage or salary for four-member households was fixed at Rs.18000 in 2016. It included the Apex Court’s guidelines of 1992 for such fixation. But in rural areas, both casual workers and self- employed workers earn less than or half of this amount while regular employees earn two- third of this amount. Also, in urban areas, the earning level is still below the minimum wage fixed. This clearly depicts the poor condition of manual workers and labourers in India and the intense crisis they are facing. It also is necessary to note that the condition of female workers is worse than male workers.Indian Constitution defines minimum wage as “the level of income for skilled and unskilled workers which ensures a sustainable standard of living and also some comfort. It aims to prevent the large-scale exploitation of laborers”.Minimum Wages Act, 1948In 1928, the International Labour Organization (ILO) introduced the concept of “minimum wages” to protect the workers from exploitation of employers.Minimum Wages Act, 1948 came into force just after India gained its freedom. It was introduced to bring equality and justice to labourers and workers and to ensure that there is a uniform wage for the same kind of work either done by male or female workers. Minimum wages are revised within every five years. Both the Central and State Government(s) have the power to revise minimum wages. Objectives of Minimum Wage Act, 1948Violation of the Act results in offences and there are penalties of five year imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 10000/- (under section 22 of act).Our Apex Court held that the non-payment of minimum wages will lead to “forced labour” and is prohibited under Article 23 of the Constitution. Forced labour can arise in several ways including appetite, poverty, need and necessity etc. The Minimum Wages Act, 1948 does not violate Article 14 of the Indian Constitution, which deals with “equality before the law”, as wages are not fixed across the entire country and vary from place to place and occupation to occupation. Constitutional validity of the act cannot be doubted. Hence, there is no uniform wage across the nation and the system too, is complex.The fact that sometimes it is difficult for the employer to carry out business on settled terms may not be the reason to strike down the law itself as unreasonable. Plight of workers should also be considered to determine whether the law adhered to public interest.Dispute between MGNREGA and Minimum Wages Act, 1948The Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (MGNREGA) is a scheme that guarantees 100 days employment at Rs. 120 per day. In January 2009, the Ministry of Rural Development (MoRD) delinked the MGNREGA wages from state specific minimum wage rates. This undermined the sanctity of Minimum Wages Act, 1948. MGNREGA wage rates were lesser than minimum wage rates of respective states. Jean Dreze who chaired the National Advisory Council and Central Employment Guarantee Council, recommended that the wage rates of MGNREGA be synced with the Minimum Wages Act but the recommendations were rejected by the Central Government. The Central Government froze MGNREGA wages. In the end, the Prime Minister agreed to accept the recommendations and indexed MGNREGA wage rate to minimum wage rates until the Advisory Committee made a satisfactory index. Pandemic and Workers ConditionThe pandemic has led to labourers and workers suffering. Nationwide lockdown seems like the only option to control the virus-spread, but it has resulted in shutdown of big businesses, industries, factories etc. Many workers have lost their jobs. Because of no jobs workers are returning back to their villages, along with their families and belongings. This again highlights their insecure working conditions. Not only have they lost their daily earnings but also they are at great risk of contacting COVID- 19 or facing starvation. During this lockdown, only the middle classes and well off sections are able to survive but workers have marginal income and savings and it is very difficult for poor working class to manage day-to-day activities unless the Government makes some efforts to improve their condition.To safeguard that employee has proper health and comfort.To make sure that labour gets fair income.To make sure that labour lives a simple and respectful life in the society."

    "data": "This article has been written by Samta Sharma from JIMS, School of Law, Greater Noida and curated by Sahana Arya from Ansal university, Gurgaon. “While a murderer destroys the physical frame of the victim, a rapist degrades and defiles the soul of a helpless female”Despite decades of attention & legal actions rape culture or cases have represented that no sector can remain untouched & unaffected by it. Unwelcome rape & sexual behaviour has been a serious worldwide problem from decades which have not even spared innocent girls of 5 years or girls in the age bracket of 2-18. Some cases are not only about rape but causing injury or damage in the internal organs which is beyond cure. These cases are rude shock to humanity and in order to effectively address sexual exploitation & sexual abuse of children under the age of 18, the act of POSCO, 2012 was enacted to provide a legal framework for the safety & security of the children. Sexual violence can have psychological, emotional and physical effects on a survivor. These effects aren’t easy to deal with & need the proper support & help for the process of healing. Therefore, some sections & rules under POSCO act handle such cases to meet the immediate need of the victim and under this, it provides the timely compensation and proper rehabilitation to the victim and its family. Now here a question deserves to be ask- Is the government machinery really providing adequate compensation relief to all the sexual assault victims?The present article aims to address the core concern of ‘victim rights’ with features and roles of government in providing them ‘Victim Compensation & Rehabilitation under POSCO act.’ The realization by the Indian Government that the ‘victim’ lies in the core of entire criminal justice has helped the victims in germinating their seeds during the last few decades. One of the principle facet of victim support is ‘compensation for injuries’. Subsequently, the incorporation of Section 357A in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 lately became the need of the hour and therefore it was set as an obligation to provide the survivor or victim, who have suffered injury to provide them with sufficient victim compensation & proper rehabilitation facilities.Lets examine what the statutes says about it- Section 33(8) of POSCO that in inclusion to punishment, the Special Court may direct adequate payment of compensation for the mental/physical damage caused to the child or for the immediate rehabilitation. Though now it is crystal clear that the law has made it mandatory but what about its implementation? POSCO victims are still facing gigantic complication in this respect. The implementation of this law has left so many confusions & questions in the minds of people. There is still confusion as to whether Delhi Legal Services Committee or the Special Court is to decide the amount, though a thorough reading of the Act made it quite apparent that the latter was the disbursing authority. At the top of it, there are even some cases or conditions where the compensation wasn’t granted by the special court and if granted then the amounts were rather scanty and arbitrary. In a sample study conducted by Delhi Commission, it revealed the following challenges face by the victim & their respective family- It is sad that the cycle of rape cases is running more faster than the cycle of government machinery. While the issues were still adding to the list, the Supreme Court passed a direction in the famous case of ‘Nipun Saxena & Anr v. Union of India & Ors’, it was clearly directed by the honourable court that if in case the court repudiate to grant any interim or compensation to the victim of the crime then it shall record its reason for doing so. Therefore, it still does not mean that compensation will be granted in every case but the verdict of honourable court must be there in every case.It was the final case of ‘Unnao’ Rape case and the SC brought many of the major issues to the fore. The SC observed that guidelines of the act are not been followed properly. Apart from granting an amount of 25 lakh to the victim as interim compensation, the court also declared that an ‘Exclusive Special Court’ will be set up which will be separately and particularly dealing with the cases of POSCO act. Though the process of these courts are still underway and may took some time.Fortunately the court has given the hope by introducing their new POSCO Rules on March 9, 2020. The new notable rules are as follows: Fortunately the Union Government had approved & made the positive amendments in result of the combat rising issues of the POSCO rules & laws. After the case of Nirbhaya every rigorous & firm laws were made but unfortunately it didn’t stopped the problem. The new amendment had given ‘a ray of hope’ to everyone. Conclusion:There has been a paradigm shift in the approach of criminal justice with regard to victim of crime. The above mentioned reports were loud & clear that though the problems are arising day by day but fortunately the government has already taken bold steps towards bringing a positive change. Finally the government is trying to provide ‘speedy relief’ to the victims by minimizing their inconvenience and avoiding unnecessary delay in granting compensation to the victim. Though it is still a question that these new developments will be implemented properly or not but still a ray of hope is better than a bundle of question marks. Successful implementation of every law includes a coherent understanding which the government finally comprehends with regard to the social dignity of the children. Around 38% of victims had never received any compensation.Overall 15% of the victims had only received compensation yet.Whereas, the left out 85% never received a bit of it.After deep enquiries with 81% of parents, they stated that they weren’t able to meet with the health-care needs of their child.There are some additions being done in the Rule 3 of the act that mandates the State & Central Government to maintain the appropriate awareness, the dispersal of information at different public places like airports, railways & etc. Apart from this, the provision is also made to frame or formulate a ‘Child Protection Policy’ which will indeed take care of the child’s prevention & cure both.Rule 4 speaks in support of child’s benefit that the victim’s support person (who is appointed for the benefit of child) must submit a monthly report to the Child Welfare Committee.Form A & Rule 4 (14) of the act guarantees that every victim and his/her respective family is made aware of their rights under the act when they will transfer the information to Police.Rule 8 speaks for ‘Special Relief’ in case of any emergency or essential need that is to be provided by the concerned Child Welfare Committee."

    "data": " This article is written by Mansi Vyas of Law College, UOR, Jaipur and Curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater Noida.“Freedom of the press is not just important to democracy, it is democracy.”-Walter CronkiteAs citizens of a democratic state, we have the right to know, tell, and comment on the national happenings. Furthermore, these rights could only be accomplished through the fourth pillar of democracy i.e., Media. It is an essential pillar as it keeps a check on the other pillars. The above is possible only through a free media and a free press. In the absence of such a check, democracy would be in danger.In the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the preamble states that “…human beings shall enjoy the freedom of speech and belief …”. In Art. 19 of the Indian Constitution, it is stated that such freedom includes freedom of uninterrupted receival, an impartation of information, and ideas through media. It is owing to this right that our constitution adopted Article 19 i.e., freedom of speech and expression.The freedom of press is developed by some of the following cases:Recognition of freedom of press-Removing unreasonable restrictions on press-Acknowledging reasonable rights of press-Protecting advertisements as part of media-Hence, it is via the fundamental right of Article 19 that we deduce the rights of the press.No matter how systematically the rules got framed, history repeats itself, and we have a history of unsatisfied execution of laws—the evidence of the conditions of the press. “Newspapers are not made any longer by news or journalism. The sheer weight is making them of money, expressed in gift schemes. They do not serve the interests of the many, but the vested interests of the few.”The actual situation of the freedom of press could be known through two major aspects- If not directly, the press and journalists are pressurized by the government and people in many indirect ways. Accusing journalists of sedition, libellous newspapers, and the entire media of being anti-nationalists are some of the most common ways of frightening them. With the advancing world, the digitalization of media has multiplied voices with a good connotation and has also given birth to new threats. The possibilities of people and government destroying their lives pose a sense of self-censorship on them. The noisy statistics and the alarming realizations make it very clear that the current press situation is not even near the tag of being a “free” one. All the above is not shocking news as we have already acquired 142 rank out of 180 countries in the World Press Freedom Index 2020. It is just another evidence of the fact that we are living under the illusion of free press. The government should let sink in their minds that free press is not about praising the authority; in fact, it is the exact opposite. People need to realize that silencing the journalists is of no good; if so happens, the time is not far away when all news channels will sound the same, and having so many channels over DoorDarshan will not be of any good. We should try and change the scenario as long as we actually can! “When the public’s right to know is threatened, and when the rights of free speech and free press are at risk, all of the other liberties we hold dear are endangered.” – Christopher DoddRomesh Thappar v The State of Madras 1950– It was held that “freedom of speech and expression includes freedom of propagation of ideas, and that freedom is ensured by the freedom of circulation.”Prabha Dutt v Union of India & others 1962– It was held that the constitutional right of freedom of speech and expression conferred by article 19(1)(a) of the constitution which includes the freedom of the press, is not an absolute one…”Bennett Coleman and Co. v Union of India 1973– Import order 1955, Newsprint order 1962, and Newsprint policy 1972-73 were held as unconstitutional. The Court held that “the law laying excessive and prohibitive burden restricting the circulation of a newspaper will not be saved by Article 19(2).Sahara India Real Estate Corp. Ltd. & others v. Sebi & anr. 2012– It was held that “the media has a right to know the events happening in courts, and to disseminate the information to public…”Humdard Dawakhana v. Union of India 1960– It denied protection of Article 19(1)(a) to advertisements, saying that indeed they are a form of speech, but the fact that they are used for promotion cannot be denied. Therefore, merely denying traders from commending his wares would not fall within the purview of Article 19(1)(a).Indian Express Newspaper Pvt. Ltd. v. Union of India 1985– It was held that the above-mentioned case put restrictions on “unethical” advertisement, but in way of doing that, it denied protection of Article 19(1)(a) to all the commercial advertisements. Therefore, “all commercial advertisements cannot be denied the protection of Article 19(1)(a) merely because they are issued by businessmen.” Pressure on press and Conditions of Journalists.Pressure on the press in an undeniable fact. Almost all of us have a fair idea about the biasedness of news channels, news reporters, and journalists to their respected political parties. Most of them, if not all, are pressurized by powerful governments, colleagues, relatives, and even ordinary people. The governments have been hijacking the press for a very long time. Recently, the current government got accused of being like Indra Gandhi. It is said to be an era of “undeclared emergency.”Conditions of journalists are not something we are unaware of. According to the Global Impunity index- since 1992, 48 journalists have been killed, 34 have been targeted for murder, and 32 have been murdered with impunity. Furthermore, India has been ranked 14th among the states where journalists are murdered, and their killers go free. India has been on the index 11 times, and the report says that the conditions are worsening with no signs of improvement."

    "data": "This article is written by Samta Sharma from JIMS, School Of Law, IPU and curated by Sahana Arya from Ansal University, Gurgaon ”Any system that values profit over human life is a very dangerous one indeed. It simply lacks values, and such a system will eventually collapse once its true light is discovered by the masses.”In every human society, there is an effort continually tending to confer on one part the height of power and happiness, and to reduce the other to the extreme of weakness and misery. We all are aware that ‘White Collar Workers’ are the ones who flourish the economy of a country, but have you ever heard about ‘White Collar Criminals’? They at the same time dwindles the economy of a country by committing criminal offences. The public, who is unaware of its costs and indifferent to its control, gets trapped into it. White collar crime is a broad term that encompasses many types of non violent criminal offenses including fraud and many other types of illegal offences.It is said that education is a powerful agent of change that contributes to long term economic growth but here a pertinent question arises that, what if the educated class of society ruins the principle of education and misuse their powers to harm others?This article further attempts to define the problems, nature & scope of white collar crime. Since we all are aware that corruption has been the source for the demise of every great civilization, in the same way white collar crime has also been. It is a very serious issue that needs to be addressed with the utmost perspective as many people have to suffer in this quagmire even when they are innocent. White collar crime is mainly committed by those people who belong to the society of higher class. These people have mainly a better understanding of the technology and their respective field. According to the FBI, the agency that investigates these offences said, “these crimes are characterized by deceit, concealment, or violation of trust.” The motive of these crimes is probably to obtain or avoid losing money, property or to secure business advantage.Undoubtedly the advantage of technology and advanced science has contributed to emergence of ‘mass society’. NATURE AND SCOPE OF WHITE COLLAR CRIME:The concept of this was first laid down by Prof. Edwin Sutherland in 1941. The scope of white collar crime is being expanded to a great height & reaching its peak day by day. Any system that values profit over human life is a very dangerous one indeed. It simply lacks values, and such a system will eventually collapse once its true light is discovered by the masses.” The modern developments in the technology areas have given new dimensions to computer related crimes known as cyber crimes. The areas affected by these crimes are banking and financial institutions, industry, business etc.Unlike other types of criminals, white collar criminals are enjoying a variety of social & economic profits. As such, the white collar crimes are expanding on a daily basis, it damages and distorts society on a large scale because the laws are not properly administered and therefore there is a need to curb the factors that are helping in the commission of such crimes. CAUSES:Generally these crimes are committed for the purpose of greed or economic stability but sometimes the cause of these crimes depends upon the situational pressure and some other reasons that are: TYPES OF WHITE COLLAR CRIME:There are different types of crimes under white collar and some of them are: There are many types of examples like these because white collar crimes are potent in nearly all the professions and are frequent and common in the business world. LAWS RELATING TO WHITE COLLAR CRIMES:The government of India has introduced several laws, the breach of which can amount to white collar criminality. The IPC contains the provisions to check crimes such as credit card fraud, insurance fraud and etc.In order to handle the computer based crimes ITA, 2000 has provided several provisions under Section 43 and 44. MEASURES:Finally the government should take the responsibility to provide enough powers to the law enforcement agencies because without the help of agencies the problem of corruption and falsification cannot be exterminated. CONCLUSION:In a country like India where a large scale of population gets poorly affected by mass illiteracy, starvation and many other infinite number of crucial problems, which needs a strict constituted system for tackling the current situation. With this it can be concluded that the provisions of Indian Penal Code dealing with white-collar crimes should be amended to intensify punishment particularly fine in tune with changed socio-economic conditions. Therefore along with the government we can try to reduce the risk of such crimes.Lack of Awareness: Some of the offenders commit such crimes because of lack of awareness in people. Here people barely understand that they are the victim of the worst crime.Necessity: Many of the people commit such crimes to fulfill their family needs and satisfy their ego. Greed: One of the main reasons for such crime is greed as people get more motivated when they see others breaking the rules and follow the same.Computer Frauds: It includes hacking and looting someone’s information.Tax Fraud: It includes evading tax information by misrepresentation. Extortion: When someone obtains the property of others illegally.Insider Trading: When someone uses the inside/personal information for the purpose of trading or earning profit.Embezzlement: When a person is entrusted with property or money & uses it for their personal use. While white collar crimes have become a matter of global concern it is important to aware the public against these crimes by using the platforms of press, social media, radio and several advertisements. Laws should be made more strict and award sentences of imprisonment to the offenders of such crimes. There should be rigid regulatory laws and serious punishments should be provided to curb these types of crimes. Fast track courts should be made by appointing more judges for taking action more quickly."

    "headline": "IS THE GOVERNMENT SERIOUS ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF MANUAL SCAVENGERS?Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra Bars Senior Lawyers From Orally Mentioning Their Cases in Supreme CourtENCOUNTER: DEPRIVATION OF RIGHT TO LIFE UNDER ARTICLE 21Online Sexual Violence Won’t Go Unpunished",
    "data": "This article is written by Muskaan Bangani by Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan, and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University.In India, the practice of manual scavenging is widely prevalent.Years and years have passed, yet no concrete steps have been taken to stop this filthy and disgusting practice. The promises made by the current government are shallow and ineffective. Just like the other politicians before her, Nirmala Sitharaman had also promised in her last budget speech to abolish manual cleaning of sewage tanks. However, she too seems to have forgotten her promise.During this pandemic, Sitharaman announced an insurance scheme for all the COVID-19 warriors, who died while saving the lives of the patient. If healthcare workers die on duty, they are called martyrs. They have their life insured. But if our sanitary soldiers die, no one bats an eyelid.From the legal perspective, there were two acts introduced by the Parliament to eradicate the problem. The first one was The Employment of Manual Scavengers and Construction of Dry Latrines (Prohibition) Act,1993, which made manual scavenging a cognizable offense. But the irony is that there is not a single case filed against the accused under the said act. The second act, The Prohibition of Employment as Manual Scavengers and their Rehabilitation Act, 2013 was introduced to preserve the rights of manual scavengers and address the issue of rehabilitation, but this also failed miserably on the account of implementation. This act imposed stricter penalties and made the offense non-bailable. The act aimed to dismiss hazardous cleaning, with the condition that the sanitation worker is provided with suitable protective gear. According to them, protective gear includes gloves only. Thirdly, in The Constitution of India, 1950, Article 15 prohibits discrimination based on caste and gender, Article 17 abolishes untouchability, Article 21 states the right to live a healthy life with dignity, Article 23 abolishes forced labor. However, the ground reality is different because the community of Dalits is forced to clean hundreds of septic tanks every day. Even after 73 years of independence, these workers die while doing what they think is their duty, and nobody in the government/administration cares. The problems faced by these manual scavengers have never been considered by the State as the state is not willing to accept them as a part of our community.It is common knowledge that Indian Railways is the largest employer of manual scavengers.The hypocrisy of the government is apparent when the administration on one hand promises to eradicate the practice of manual scavenging whereas on the other hand, hires manual scavengers from private contractors, on the pretext of generating employment. This leads to further exploitation of the already exploited Dalit community.Narendra Modi’s ‘‘Swachh Bharat Abhiyan’’ has been promoting personal hygiene, community hygiene through a nationwide cleanliness campaign. The campaign has been reduced to becoming a regular photo-op for ministers and other leaders. One can find them featured in local newspapers and magazines holding brooms and sweeping floors. In all these self-advertising and self-endorsing gimmicks, the manual scavenger is missing. For he is the one who cleans toilets, gutters, sewage pits, etc. without any protective gear or life/medical insurance. They are not merely sanitation workers but warriors. But the sad yet bitter truth is that these selfless warriors are dying while cleaning India’s dirt and filth. The biggest flaw in Swachh Bharat Abhiyan is that the Abhiyan is implemented to build a good sanitation facility for all but the responsibility of cleaning the toilets is in the hands of a particular community only. Why this injustice?According to the Socio-Economic Census, there are about 182,505 people in rural areas that are engaged in manual scavenging.According to the Census of India survey, 2011, there are nearly 740,078 families who are engaged in manual scavenging.According to a 2017 survey by the ministry, there are 53,326 people, in over 12 states that are engaged in manual scavenging. Delhi accounts for 43,000 scavengers alone.Uttar Pradesh alone has 28,796 scavengers. In the state of Uttar Pradesh, 95% of the manual scavengers are female. In Manipur, there are 600 manual scavengers alone.Prime Minister Narendra Modi claims in his book Karamyogi that manual scavenging work is a spiritual experience. A more accurate description is the one given by Dr. B.R. Ambedkar: “In India, a man is not a scavenger because of his work. He is a scavenger because of his birth irrespective of the question of whether he scavenges or not.”CONCLUSION:It has been more than six years but our Prime Minister has not spent a single penny for the development and upliftment of manual scavengers even after repeated assurances. During the previous tenure of the UPA government, they had spent Rs.55 crores in the year 2013-2014, however, after this no one spent a single penny for them.It’s high time the government at the helm of affairs, takes serious cognizance of these numbers and takes concrete steps to abolish the system of manual scavenging by using technology and looking for alternate means of cleaning and disposal of filth. Unless they come to the rescue of this community, by acting as a savior, we will be defeated in the very idea of B. R. Ambedkar, that we pretend to uphold. "

    "headline": "Right to Information: Evolution and Recent SetbacksStatus Quo of Italian Immigration LawsLAWS PROTECTING JOURNALISTS FROM ONLINE HARASSMENTBrief on Right to Privacy Judgement",
    "data": "This article has been written by Himanshu Batar from IMS Unison University and Curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater NoidaIntroduction“Absolute power corrupts absolutely,” the statement by Lord Acton stands true for every government system. The only way to counter this is by creating transparency between government officials and the public. Right to Information (RTI) has come into existence to fulfil the same requirement. In India, from its origin in 1975, RTI has developed and evolved a lot. However, the recent developments and decisions have resulted in a significant setback in the field of RTIEvolution of RTIStarting as a part of the election manifesto of the Janata Party government led by Morarji Desai, the RTI finally found its way to become a fundamental right under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution by the famous case of Mr. Kulwal v. Jaipur Municipal corporation. However, despite firm commitments from various governments, not much work was done in RTI. Efforts of Mazdoor Kisan Shakti Sangathan (MKSS) in 1994 revived the need for RTI and resulted in passing a law on RTI in Rajasthan in 2000. Another campaign, National Campaign for People’s Right to Information (NCPRI) in 1996, with the constant demand for enactment of an RTI law, resulted in making Tamil Nadu the first state to pass an RTI law in 1997. Finally, the RTI Act 2005 was passed, which applies to the whole of India.RTI got implemented after the case of Benette Coleman and company v. Union of India, in which it was held that the freedom of speech includes within its purview, the right of citizens to be informed. The scope of RTI developed gradually and started including giving information to the customers regarding the composition of food products, drugs, and cosmetics as a fundamental right after Ozair Hussain v. Union of India. In R.P. Limited v. Indian Express Newspaper, the Supreme court stated that people have the right to know, in order to take part in developmental schemes. The status of RTI was further elevated to a Human Right in the case of People’s Union for Civil Liberty v. Union of India. In Kumar v. Bangalore University, the Apex court held that the public authority cannot deny any document entirely on the grounds of confidentiality. Another significant development was from the case of Adesh Kumar v. Union of India, which laid down RTI cannot be denied on the grounds that the information the person is seeking is irrelevant. The case of Aabid Hussain v. CPIO, Jabalpur further raised the bar, as CIC remarked that long waiting for RTI response is a flagrant violation of the RTI Act. These cases show the continuous development in the field of RTI.Recent SetbacksThe recent judgment of Chief Information Commissioner V. The high court of Gujarat took a sudden back-step, in which, the SC stated that a valid reason is needed to file RTI in High courts. The same issue has harmed the basic principle of the Act taking the development of RTI a decade back. In the above case, the conflict broke between the two laws, i.e., RTI Act 2006 and Gujarat High Court Rules 1993. The former says there is no need for a reason to seek information under RTI; the later states that when a third party seeks certified copies of the documents of any case proceeding, their application must be supported with an affidavit stating the grounds on which the documents are required. The whole judgment was based on the analysis of a legal provision relevant to the issue at hand. The provision must be read in its entirety—a fundamental principle of legal reasoning. However, the Supreme court, in its analysis, unfortunately, overlooked the significant segments of legal provisions that resulted in setting an extremely low bar for RTI.Another setback was seen in a recent plea by Samyak Gangwal, challenging the Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of PMO, who refused to provide documents sought by him on the ground that PM Cares Fund is not a public authority under the RTI Act.However, on June 2, the CPIO of PMO refused the information based on the fact that PM CARES is not considered as a public authority under the scope of the RTI Act. The plea that challenged the decision argued PM CARES is a body owned or/and controlled by the Prime Minister, ministers of Defence, Home Affairs, and Finance as its trustees, which are the parts or building blocks of the appropriate government coming under the ambit of RTI Act. Another petition on PM CARES FUND was dismissed and withdrawn as the petitioner approached the High Court without preferring an RTI application in the regard.The petition claimed that within two months of its creation, the entire fund’s corpus stands at more or less Rs ten thousand crores. Therefore, the quantity was collected upon the strength of status lent by the prime minister’s workplace. The plea, filed through advocate Aditya Hooda, revealed in newspapers on May 31 that the PM CARES fund has refused to give away data sought by Harsha Kundakarni under the RTI Act, 2005 by claiming that the fund is not a ‘public authority’ within the scope of Act. “Therefore, the application of the petitioner or anyone else would additionally meet eternal fate. Thus, the exercise of exhausting the remedy by filing another application and filing attractiveness before the statutory authority could also be distributed within the interest of justice,” he said.ConclusionThese recent judgments lowered the ambit of RTI and beat the reason for the enactment of the Act. Exclusion of PM CARES in the ambit of RTI will deny the transparency; the Act ought to provide. The same will also result in increased chances of corruption and fraud. These recent judgments need to be reviewed and revised to bring back the old progressive and developing self of RTI and a truly transparent government that will boost India’s progress.

    "headline": "ACID ATTACK: NATURE OF PROVISIONS SINCE THE DAY OF ITS EVOLUTIONCong caught between Muslim votes and women’s rights over triple talaqIMPORTANCE OF MEDICLAIM POLICY  (In reference to Advocates)Does PM Care Fund come under RTI Act, 2005?",
    "data": "This article has been written by Shubhangi Zite from ILS Law College, Pune and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.Today with development women are climbing the ladder of equality at a rapid pace. But being considered as a submissive gender by most of the men, it’s becoming difficult for them to even survive. There has been a widespread increase in violence against women all over the world. These majorly constitute crimes like rape, domestic violence, etc. and acid attack being the most horrendous and terrific crime amongst the all. These Acid Attacks have a gendered aspect to them because 72% of victims are girls and women between the age group 17-30 years. Most common acids used in acid attacks are Hydrochloric acid, Sulphuric acid, and Nitric acid. It is one of the most heinous forms of violence. An attack with the use of acid sounds a bit odd though because a while ago acid was used as a day to day commodity in every normal Indian household. But for a few years, it has become one of the most gruesome techniques to hurt other people. When somebody attacks a person with acid, his aim is not to kill the victim but to disfigure and inflict tremendous pain on the victim’s body and mind which is even harsh than a murder.There are many reasons for Acid Attacks but in 78% of cases these reasons were common:As much heinous the crime is, much more horrendous were its consequences. In some Acid Attacks, women lost their eyesight, in some their bones melted because of acid, in some their face became so disfigured that it was hard to make out which parts were nose, mouth, and eyes. These were physical consequences but the psychological consequences made it the worst. Psychological consequences are more painful than physical consequences. These attacks have a deep-rooted impact not only on the victims but also on their families. Some victims were damaged to such an extent both physically and psychologically that they demanded euthanasia. In India, the first case of Acid Attack was back in 1982, yet we didn’t have separate provisions for it till 2013. Earlier the offence of Acid Attack was registered under sections 320 (Grievous hurt), 322 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 325 (Punishment for voluntarily causing grievous hurt), 326 (Voluntarily causing grievous hurt by dangerous weapons or means) and 307 (Attempt to murder) of the Indian Penal Code. The punishment for Acid Attack back then was maximum for seven years along with fine except those who were liable under section 307 I.P.C. (they were given life imprisonment). Before the 2013 amendment, accused in Acid Attacks were partially booked under hurt and were easily released on bail.After the suggestions made by the 226th Law Commission Report and Justice J. S. Verma committee, the specific provision dealing with Acid Attack was introduced on 2nd April 2013. The I.P.C. was amended with the passing of “The Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 2013”. This amendment led to the insertion of sections 326 A and 326 B for specifically dealing with Acid Attacks. Section 326 A states that “Whoever causes permanent or partial damage or deformity to, or burns or disfigures or disables, any part or parts of the body of a person or causes grievous hurt by throwing acid on or by administering acid to that person, or by using any other means to cause or with the knowledge that he is likely to cause such injury or hurt, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than ten years but which may extend to imprisonment for life, and with fine.”Section 326 B states that “Whoever throws or attempts to throw acid on any person or attempts to administer acid to any person, or attempts to use any other means, intending to cause permanent or partial damage or deformity or burns or disfigurement or disability or grievous hurt to that person, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which shall not be less than five years but which may extend to seven years, and shall also be liable to fine.”In 2017, a bill was introduced to provide for steps to prevent Acid Attack by regulating the sale, supply, and use of acid, and other measures. Steps were proposed for the rehabilitation of victims and related matters. Under this bill, no person shall be allowed to sell or deliver or transport acid without a proper record of their identity, quantity of acid involved, and purpose for which it is to be used. It also provided for the increase in maximum punishment for Acid Attacks under section 326 B of the I.P.C. to the imprisonment of 10 years.CONCLUSION:India being a developing nation lags immensely in protecting its citizens from Acid Attacks. According to the reports of the National Crime Records Bureau in 2015, there were 222 Acid Attacks which further increased in 2016 to 223 and 2017 to 244. Though, now, we have specific provisions for Acid Attacks but are we able to implement them? The success of any law depends upon its implementation and if we are not able to implement them then there is no use of having that law. Today in 2020 also, acids are sold openly in stores without anyone supervising its sale. Acid Attacks have such a huge impact on victims that they cannot be normal for their lifetime. They cannot go out openly, they cannot marry and nobody accepts them. The lives of these victims become so miserable that they end up ending themselves. There is a need for stricter implementation of such laws if we as a nation want to develop healthily and equally. Rejection of marriage proposals.Rejected sexual advances.The showcase of male egoism.PatriarchyMisogyny etc."

    "headline": "RECENT MODIFICATIONS AND JUDGMENTS IN AUTOMOBILE SECTORABORTION AND PREVALENT LAWS IN INDIA: CHANGE IS THE NEED OF THE HOURIMPLICATIONS ON THE LAW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DURING THE PANDEMICCLAT RESULTS 2019",
    "data": "This article is written by Kashish Goyal from Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan and curated by Shruti Chaudhary from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.The automobile industry is one of the most important sectors of our country. This sector plays a vital role in designing, selling, manufacturing, transporting of motor vehicles. Many changes have been done in this sector in terms of the Motor Vehicle Act and relief measures.As per the notification of the Central Government, the Motor Vehicle (Amendment) Bill, 2019, has introduced the changes in penalties. This act is drafted to deter individuals from violating the rules. With this, it also provides medical assistance to the victim of an accident. The penalties and fines have also been increased, for example, for not wearing a helmet Rs 100 to Rs 1000 with 3 months disqualification for speeding or racing- Rs 500- Rs 5000, for offences committed by the juvenile – the guardian has to pay Rs 25000 with 3-year imprisonment, for drunk and driving- Rs 2000 to Rs 10000.In January 2019, the Hon’ble Supreme Court ordered that they could not alter the manufacturing which is made by the manufacturer for the purpose of registration. Section 52 of the Motor Vehicle Act deals with Alteration of vehicle and it illustrates the extent to which the altercation can be done.A recent judgment on the Motor vehicle Act named Ramkhiladi &Anr v. The United India Insurance Company, is related to section 163 A of Motor Vehicle Act and talks about the liability of the owner or authorized owner when there is a disablement due to an accident by motor vehicle. In such cases, when any person claims the insurance from the company, negligence on the part of the person is not required to be proved, it is enough to prove that the deceased died or any permanent disablement occurs. The compensation can be claimed only by the claimants, not by any other or third party. This is because it is possible that the person who is driving the vehicle is the relative or the borrower of the owner and if in case the accident occurs, they would not be covered under the category of claimants. For example, the parties are governed by the contract of insurance as illustrated in this case also and the insurance company will be liable to the third party as per the deed.Recently, one more change also took place in the Payments for driving license, on 30th of March, 2020 i.e. the government extended the validity of payments for obtaining the documents like driving license, Certificate of Vehicle to 31st of July, 2020. The Ministry of Roads and Transport has stated that no additional fees will be charged if in case there is a delay in payment from the 1st of February till the completion of the period of lockdown.The main reason behind this extension was that, as some have already paid the amount related to renewal or any other documents related to the vehicle, the money is not deposited due to lacking in communication between the ministry and the government. Additionally, because of this, it was also ordered that the money which was already deposited will remain valid and that there is no need to apply for the procedure again.And the documents which have already expired means since 1st February or they will expire till 30th June, for the enforcement of the validity of the document would be till 30th June. This has benefitted some people because in this pandemic they are not getting registration on time, but for those who have already registered, this extension is of no use.A good change has been made in providing compensation to those people who had disabled their limbs due to an accident. It was a good judgement delivered by the Supreme Court. Earlier the person who got disabled by the accident would be awarded the compensation for only 25% of the whole body by the Motor Accident claim tribunal. This was too unfair and an unreasonable percentage. If in case the percentage of disability in the whole body is assessed as more than 50% how would the person be able to get relief if he was a poor worker. The percentage should be decided on the basis of the majority of people.In Sri Anthony alias Anthony Swamy v. the managing Director, K.S.R.T.C, the Supreme Court observed this irrationality and also fixed the functional disability to 75% who had disabled due to the accident. The main motive behind this is to provide the compensation and ensure that the person lives with dignity. The compensation should be provided on the basis of the future earnings of people.An announcement was made by the Finance Minister regarding the automobile industry about increasing the depreciation cost on automobiles with this the tax which is levied on products will be cut off. This was done to boost the demand for vehicles in the sector and to get off the unfit vehicles on the road so that there will be a high increased in demand for new vehicles.In India, the automobile sector has been going through a slump for the last nine months. The majority of this loss has occurred in the automobile sector during the lockdown period. These measures might help to come up with the gain in the sector. While making any decision regarding the measures the main consideration must be a middle man who should not be made to suffer.A change about the Bharat emission standards – IV, in which they had to sell the stock of BS-IV till 31st March i.e. during the period of lockdown as they want to establish BS-VI norms, but an instant change in the business model can lead to falling in the growth of the sector. It is true that each sector has its own issues. The Indian auto sector has been going through a slowdown. Many of the companies have already sold their inventory because of the emission standards. Every business or company needs time to adapt to any of the changes in the industry.It is concluded that the changes and the amendments which have been done in the automobile sector have laid a huge impact on the level of growth. Each change has its own positive and negative impacts on any business."

    "data": "This article has been written by Riya Kaushik of Geeta Institute of Law and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia of NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.Recently, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has passed adjustments related to migrant workers. The apex Court has ordered all the states to make arrangement for the deployment of all the migrant workers to their native states. The Hon’ble Court directed that the Centre and all the state governments should finish this process within 15 days and it also ordered the governments to make arrangements for the employment of such migrant laborers by formulating various employment schemes. The skill mapping of the workers should be done to rehabilitate them.The migrant workers have faced many hardships amidst the lockdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The factories and workplaces where they were working have been shut down because of the lockdown imposed by the Central Government. They are facing various financial crises such as loss of income, food shortage and uncertainty about their future. Millions of migrant workers are returning to their homes with no means of transportation due to the lockdown. The Hon’ble Supreme Court has recognized their hardship and has taken suo moto cognizance for their situation and the hardships faced by them.The various key points in the judgment of the Hon’ble Supreme Court are: –The apex Court pronounced its order through video conferencing. It also said that all the states should provide counseling to the migrant workers who have returned to their homes. The order was pronounced by a three-member bench which was headed by Justice Ashok Bhushan and comprising of Justice SK Kaul and Justice MR Shah. The directions were passed to mitigate the plight faced by the migrant workers.Millions of workers and the daily wage earners are returning to their homes leaving their workplaces in the aftermath of the lockdown which was done to stop the spread of the worldwide pandemic COVID-19.The 38-page order of the Supreme Court was a follow up of its previous order which was suo moto cognizance taken by the Court on the hardships faced by the migrants who were trying to return to their villages. The Court received various responses from the state and union territories after which it issued such various directions for their rehabilitation.The Court also noted lapse on the part of Centre and state agencies in implementing the various welfare schemes. The Non-governmental organizations and individuals have filed intervention application pointing out the lapse of the Centre and state agencies. The Court also finds gaps in registration of migrant workers due to language barriers and called for the decentralized process for the registration of the migrant workers. This facility is provided to the migrant workers at the police stations and at the other places of local administration.It further said that strict vigilance and supervision should be imposed to find out whether the measures taken for the prevention of the human rights of these workers are being implemented or not and whether the welfare schemes made for the migrants were reaching them or not. The Court said that mere churning about the politics and declaring measures and schemes is not the job of government. A review of the successful implementation of all those measures should also have to be taken by the government.The Court also applauded the spirit of the individuals who had come forward to help the migrant workers. It also recognized the contribution of various non-governmental organizations who had helped the workers by providing them food, water and transportation cost to return to their homes. The Court has ordered the state and union territory governments to make a list of all the migrant workers who have reached their state or territory. The work they were associated with before the lockdown is also to be mentioned in the list.The Court has asked the Centre and state governments to specify the schemes for the employment and welfare of these workers post-lockdown which can be availed by them for rehabilitation. A list of all such schemes should be sent to Court within two weeks.The Hon’ble Supreme Court also said that the Railways will provide Shramik Special Trains at the request of state and union territories for the transportation of migrant workers. The Centre said that the state has requested for 171 trains for the transportation of remaining migrant workers to their homes. The timing of the special trains and busses for the transportation of the migrants workers should be publicized in various local newspapers and television channels to make reach of this information to a great extent of mass public.The Hon’ble Court also ordered to withdraw all the police complaints made against the migrant workers who were alleged to be responsible in violating the norms of lockdown while they were doing so to reach their homes. Such complaints were registered against them under section 51 of the Disaster Management Act."

    "headline": "Hospitalized Cage: Can Hospitals Detain Patients over Unsettled Bills?CRIME AGAINST WOMENIS DENIAL OF HUMAN RIGHTS TO TRANSGENDER COMMUNITY DURING LOCK DOWN REASONABLE?Drastic Changes in Advocates Act 1961",
    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma of JEMTEC, School of Law, Greater Noida and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia of NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.Under Section 340 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, no person can be wrongfully confined without lawful jurisdiction and every person has the Fundamental Right to life and personal liberty enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Once proved that a person has been unlawfully confined, the burden of proof shifts to the accused party to show and justify that confinement was not unlawful.Detaining patients in the hospitals due to unpaid bills will infringe their Fundamental Right of life and personal liberty and will amount to wrongful confinement under Section 340 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Recently, a 60 year old man was tied and detained to a hospital bed in Madhya Pradesh due to non-payment of Rs. 11,200 due to the hospital. The video got viral on the internet and drew the attention of people following which the administration suspended the licence of the hospital.In Devesh Singh Chauhan v. State & Ors., the Court held that merely because the hospital is giving outstanding treatments to the patients, it is no ground to detain the patient and deprecated the practice.Patients have been provided with various rights such as right to records, right to medical emergency care, right to informed consent, right to non-discrimination, right to be discharged, etc. as per the Charter of Patients’ Rights, released by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and prepared by National Human Rights Commission (NHRC). In the case of Consumer Education and Research Centre v. Union of India, the Court held that Article 21 read with Directive Principles guaranteed under Articles 39(e), 41 and 43 makes the right to health and medical care a Fundamental Right. Also, in the case of Paschim Banga Khet Mazdoor Samiti v. State of West Bengal, the Court made it crystal clear that the government hospitals and medical officers are duty bound to provide medical assistance to their patients and failure in doing so would violate Article 21 under the Constitution of India. The hospitals cannot refuse providing medical treatments to the patients on the ground that they are unable to pay the expenses of the treatment. Public health is also under State List under List-II under the Constitution of India.In the case of Sanjay S Prajapati v. State of Maharashtra, the Court observed that the detention of the patients due to non-payment of the dues will amount to wrongful confinement under section 340 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Therefore, it is established that detaining the patient or the dead body is not only unconstitutional and unlawful but immoral, inhuman and torturous for the patient and family members. This practice by the honourable Courts in the series of judgments has been deprecated.Nevertheless, a balance needs to be maintained between the patients who are unable to pay and thereby unlawfully detained in the hospital and the hospitals who receive threats and assaults. Proper guidelines should be enforced in order to protect the rights of the patients and the hospitals too. The current legal scenario can be used arbitrarily by the patients which makes it unjust for the hospitals and their hardworking workers. The hospital too has the right to recover timely dues for the treatments provided by them. The Court in the case of Trevor Nerves Britto v. State of Maharashtra held that some type of mechanism has to be introduced for the hospitals in order to receive the rightful dues. It is not out of place to expect such judicial activism on the part of the judiciary at this hour."

    "data": "Covid-19, a natural Human Disaster have forced the entire world into a nation-wide Lockdown. Undoubtedly, the lockdown was encouraged wholeheartedly by the nation-wide medical staff and government. But unfortunately, in India, the cost of lockdown has been very expensive for the unorganized sector of the country as it has completely seized the financial support & socio-economic system. Lockdown, for the companies, is nothing, but an unsolicited challenge to find a roof and three-time meal under this pandemic.As we have already acknowledged that Indian informal sectors are getting worst-hit by the ongoing lockdown. Have you ever thought how is the Indian government dealing with it?What is the role of government in providing them a ‘well-dignified life’? (which is also a right of every individual in a democratic country like India).This article aims to address the role played by the judiciary, challenges faced by the unorganized sector, statutory provisions, and role of labour law during this pandemic.On one hand, the whole world is fighting against Covid-19 and on the other, we have a large number of populations belonging to an unorganized sector fighting their own battles under poverty and Covid-19 altogether. Lakhs of migrant workers are rendered jobless and are struggling with a hungry stomach on the Indian streets. The travelling back of labourers to their respective homes has not only affected the workers but has also affected the whole nation and the organised sectors as it has created a lack of manual labour in various cities. Despondently, India is at a major risk of facing severe unemployment again. Since we all know that it is impossible to ignore the plight of unorganized section, many petitions were filed lately concerning the unorganized sector. A brief case report of Harsh Mander & Anr. vs UOI has caught many news reporters and editor’s attention. In this case, the petitioner was an Indian author who works with survivors of hunger, and homeless people including street children. He filed a writ petition before the honourable court pointing out the intense humanitarian crisis created by the lockdown with regard to the concern of state’s migrant workers. The petitioner raised his points in favour of the migrants seeking the upholding of ‘right to life with dignity’ stated under Article 19 of the Constitution of India. The Central demand was that the State Government and the Central Government should ‘jointly and severally’ take measures. According to a recent study conducted by the NGO, the aid facility is not even reachable to the migrant workers. The petition also demanded that this work should be done by self-identification and self-attestation. JUDGEMENT:The judgment was unsatisfactory on the subject of ‘right to live dignified life’. The Chief Justice claimed that if the workers are already been provided with daily three times meals, then the need for more money should be justified.The Union Government claimed that it had announced a financial package of 1.70 lakh crores. Further, many different schemes such as MGNREGA are already in process. The Union Government also stated that the financial package will take care of the daily needs of every poor person including migrant workers.Lastly, the bench stated that in the present time of crisis, no one should interfere with the decisions of the court. The case was closed without giving any proper relief to the migrants, and the final order simply read: “We call upon the respondent-Union of India to look into such material and take effective steps as it finds fit to resolve the issues raised in the petition”And despondently, for millions of state workers, the Union did not respond adequately to their plight. Many cases of such nature have come in consideration, but still, it has left the poverty-stricken sector in question that how they will ensure shelter and medicine for their children and family. On one side, Covid-19 is cutting a very expensive bill on the unorganized sector and on the other side, the state has not yet decided about their provisions, and is still taking their baby steps provisions in this serious context.Furthermore, let us focus on what provisions should be made or are already made by the government for taking care of the unorganized sector:Provisions laid by the government:The government plays a major role in managing any unforeseen situation. The Indian Government has tried to help unorganised sector by introducing the relief pack.There are several such Arrangements made by the government, but still, there is a need to add some more essential provisions into it:In short, all the necessary arrangements should be made to provide them with better living facilities.ROLE OF LABOUR LAW:Labour law plays a major role in the lives of every labour and was made particularly to protect the rights of the employees. However, it is not successful in saving the lives of unorganized sector. Its primary function is to provide equal pay and equal opportunity to the employees by eliminating discrimination. But unfortunately, it was been observed that these laws are limited only to provide advices and are not for the purpose of implementing it. It was noted that, labour law statutes such as the Industrial Disputes Act 1947, Payment of Wages Act 1937, governs payment of wages of workers/employees. Moreover, the provisions of the Industrial Disputes Act 1947 explicitly recognizes the right of an employer to lay off an employee, and reduce the wages to 50% up to a period of 45 days in certain eventualities including a natural calamity (S. 25(c) and S. 25(M)). But, according to these Sections too, it has been more than 45 days and the layoff continues and no wages has been paid yet. Hence, it seems that the Ministry of Labour and Employment has consciously chosen to issue an advisory, instead of resorting to a formal order/direction mandating payment of wages during lockdown. It is evident that the labour law made for ensuring and providing the unemployed labours a seat in every condition has failed to reach its motive, leading to worsening of situation of the unorganized sector. Conclusion:The current lockdown has casted an unprecedented economic hardship on daily wage earners. Fighting against Covid-19 needs a two-fold approach, where firstly, the policies must be ensured for the safety of the entire nation. Secondly, separate provisions should be made for ensuring the proper survival of the poor people. Further, the central and state authorities have the responsibility to direct all daily wage earners with their daily/weekly wages at the place where they are present under the lockdown. Effective measures should be made to save the poor from the cost of the pandemic.It includes a one-time-ex-gratia amount of Rs. 1000 for three crore poor senior citizens, widows, and disabled people.Women holding ‘Jan Dhan Accounts’ will get a one-time ex-gratia-amount of Rs.500 per month for 3 months.Pay-out will be given to 8.69 crore farmers under PM-KISAN.Women below the poverty line eligible for Ujjwala Scheme will get free cylinders for 3 months.Arrangements should be made for providing minimum wage to all the migrants.The principle of equal opportunity for every section of the population should be properly followed and accepted.Steps should be taken to provide them basic essential products and foodstuffs.Arrangements should be made for free medical first-aid without any discrimination.People belonging to the informal sector should get quarantine facilities whenever necessary. Proper arrangements should be made by providing them hygienic quarantine centers without any discrimination on any ground.Arrangements concerning means of transport should be done, in case, they need to travel from their workplace to home or vice versa."

    "headline": "CHILD AS A CONSUMER: PERSPECTIVE FROM LAW AND BEHAVIOURData Protection and its Importance.SC to decide on Nirbhaya case today: Will the Daughter of India get justice?Mr. Harish Salve, A Lawyer Par Excellence",
    "data": "This article is written by “Ritika Sharma” from “Ansal University”. This article is curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.INTRODUCTIONChildren’s consumer behavior may be a field that has lately been given attention by marketing, psychology, sociology, and pedagogy. The rationale is that understanding that child is a crucial part that has an influence on family’s shopping. At the same time, there’s concern about the abuse of natural child naivety and truthfulness. That’s why experts turn their focus on knowledge about child cognitive development. It’s possible to easily accept protective measures to make sure the safety of child consumer only we all know how consumer develops.The promotion of interests, health and safety of European consumers was written into the 1992 EU Treaty. The foremost recent embodiment of this was the 2012 Consumer Agenda.The European Consumer Agenda has several objectives:CHILD CONSUMERISMThe marketplace for children’s products and food is gigantic. Parents on the one hand have a tough time raising children the way they have to, while on the other hand, children are being increasingly influenced by commercialism that always goes against what parents attempt to do. Children wield enormous purchasing power, both directly and indirectly (indirectly within the sense that they are able to persuade and influence parents on what to buy). The marketing and media communicator’s interest in child consumers has been increasing recently. The thought of selling to young consumers isn’t new but the ways of integrating children into the marketing place are.Marketing includes not only the merchandise, its price, and point of sale but also the promotion and package design. According to Young, most people don’t differentiate between advertising, marketing, and promotional activity. Marketers began to remember the increasing children’s power of persuasion on their parents’ buying behavior. Advertisement, promotional offers, peer pressure, and such other influences prejudice children. Cradle-to-grave marketing is therefore highly spread because marketers are aware that the earlier the child is “caught into their nest,” the sooner they start to spice up their future loyal customer. This strategy proved to be cheaper than the strategy of building a loyal customer within adulthood or within the senior age. During this context, marketers often use knowledge of cognitive and social development of children and thus the communication strategies are adapted to this knowledge. One more reason why it is necessary to look at the kid consumer is that the undeniable fact that while the marketing develops, the customer also develops. Communication channels that were valid in the past are becoming outdated and not addressing consumers. Society-wide development contributed greatly to this situation. The event includes globalization, open market, 24/7 online service, growth of social sites, new communication technologies that enable personalized marketing approach, and lots of more.CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 2019To modernize the law concerning consumer protection and to enlarge the scope of the prevailing law and make it simpler and purposeful, the consumer Protection Act 2019 has replaced the old Consumer Protection Act, 1986. With the arrival of E-commerce, the consumers and brand owners are working to safeguard their interest during this new world which is susceptible to widespread distribution of counterfeit and infringing products taking cover under the anonymity of online transactions.But the consumer protection act, 2019 also doesn’t define or discuss child consumers and their rights. During this respect, there is a requirement for revision of consumer protection laws from a child perspective and child consumer choice. It’s impossible to look at the kid consumer through the lenses of adult consumer behavior, because the kid has specific needs, requirements, values, and attitudes. Similarly, the characterization of consumer behavior of kids and youngsters should reflect this day, meaning the time where these individuals grow old and by which they’re formed. It’s known that each generation has its own unique collection of values which they’re shaped by the cultural and political environment where they grow old and which is then reflected in their values, attitudes, and opinions. There’s a requirement for inclusion of child consumers as a separate segment under sec2 (7) in chapter 1 concerning consumer in consumer protection act 2019. Definition of child consumer, rights of child consumers need to be incorporated. The regulatory intervention of consumer law is important for ensuring informed choice, which should find a place within the consumer protection act 2019.CONCLUSIONThe market for children items and food is tremendous. Guardians from one perspective make some hard memories bringing up children the manner in which they need to, while then again, kids are by and large progressively impacted by corporate greed that regularly conflicts with what guardians are attempting to do.Indeed, even in industrialized social orders, where governments and campaigners battle for better children publicizing norms and guidelines, or improved food quality, industry retaliates leaning toward self-guideline (which seldom occurs, or is deliberately frail), and contending that it is singular decisions and guardians that are the issue.Promoting consumer safety through the 2013 Product Safety and Market Surveillance Package, and particularly through enhanced product identification and traceability, measures reinforcing safety within the natural phenomenon and thus the new rules on the safety of cosmetic products introduced in mid-2013;Enhancing knowledge of consumer rights: interactive tools, just like the buyer Classroom, are developed to inform and educate consumers and help them to completely participate within the only market;Strengthening the enforcement of consumer rules through coordinated action against breaches of EU consumer law within the sort of checks of websites (sweeps) by networks of national consumer protection authorities; and easy , fast and low-cost out-of-court procedures for consumers to hunt redress available as a results of the Directive on alternative dispute resolution (2013) and thus the Regulation on online dispute resolution (2013);Integrating consumer interests into key sectoral policies through new legislation in sectors like telecommunications, digital technologies, energy, transport and food, and new measures to increase transparency and access to retail financial services and to form it easier for account holders to modify bank accounts."

    "headline": "ONLINE LEARNING AND VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 21-A OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTIONNDA’s Presidential Candidate: Ram Nath Kovind a Dalit CrusaderThe Breaking of Shackles of Kafala Workers in QatarFive High Courts get new Chief Justices",
    "data": "Written by Shubangi Zite, ILS Law College, curated by Rajrishi Ramaswamy, Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad.The outbreak of COVID-19 has led to drastic changes in various facets of day-to- day living. Even the education system has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has further led to rise in the use of online learning. This online learning system has turned education into a luxury which cannot be afforded by the weaker section of society, hence snatching the basic rights from the people of weaker sections of society.To address the above issue, we first need to understand what Article 21-A of the Constitution stands for.The Constitution (Eighty-sixth Amendment) Act, 2002 inserted Article 21-A in the Constitution of India to provide free and compulsory education of all children in the age group of six to fourteen years, as a Fundamental Right in such a manner as the State may, by law, determine. The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act, 2009, which represents the consequential legislation envisaged under Article 21-A, states that every child has a right to full time elementary education of satisfactory and equitable quality, in a formal school which satisfies certain essential norms and standards.Article 21-A and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education (RTE) Act came into effect on 1st April, 2010. The title of the RTE Act incorporates the words ‘free and compulsory’. ‘Free’ education means that no child, other than a child who has been admitted by his or her parents to a school which is not supported by the appropriate Government, shall not be liable to pay any kind of fee or charges or expenses which may prevent him or her from pursuing and completing elementary education. ‘Compulsory’ education casts an obligation on the appropriate Government and local authorities to provide and ensure admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by all children in the 6-14 age group. With this, India has moved forward to a rights-based framework that casts a legal obligation on the Central and State Governments to implement this fundamental child right as enshrined in Article 21-A of the Constitution, in accordance with provisions of the RTE Act.There has been violation of Article 21-A of the Constitution with respect to online classes. The violation can be justified by the lack of technological support faced by people who want to get their children educated. Moreover, people whose children are studying in government schools have no idea how their children are going to get the “free and compulsory” education as envisaged under RTE and Article 21-A of the Constitution. Two illustrations of the above situation are:As the lockdown rendered him without a job, he has been working at a local grocery store as an assistant, and also runs errands for his employer. Both Murali and Sangamitra have smartphones. However, for online classes, the children are able to use only their mother’s phone as Murali needs his phone to keep in touch with his employer every day, while he is at work.“My children are attending classes on alternate days. Both of them are missing out on lessons. They complain that they cannot understand what is happening in class. Their teachers have said that we have to buy an extra phone or laptop or their attendance will be affected. Getting access to the internet is also not easy and the mobile signal is very patchy here. We also end up spending a lot of money on internet recharge so my husband is working a lot more now,” Sangamitra says.Sangamitra says that the internet is costing her many times more than what she had paid for the monthly pack as she now has to shell out Rs 48 per day for the internet. “That is also not enough. For subjects like Science and Mathematics, they have to turn on the video option. That takes up more data. If it is a subject like Kannada or English, they can listen to only the audio. But they are finding that difficult too because they say they cannot understand or pay attention,” she says. Sangamitra’s husband is the sole breadwinner of the family and currently earns Rs 10,000 per month. In addition to school fees, the internet bills, she says, are taking up a large chunk out of what they can afford to spend per month.“The children who can afford phones, internet and computers are all learning. The government has not even informed us when classes will start. How will my daughter keep up with the others who have already started studying?” Jayaram asks.The above situations show the ground reality of online classes. It leads to questions like “Are only the elites entitled to education?”; “Are poor going to remain poor forever ?” ;“Is the concept of ‘free and compulsory’ education still followed?” etc. It is not only a violation of Article 21-A of the Constitution as a whole but also the words ‘free and compulsory’ envisaged by it. There is no free education as people have to bear the extra costs of technological support. There is no compulsory education as people with no technological support have no alternatives. It is the duty of the government to constantly put the system under check and take proper actions to restore balance in it. It is their responsibility to give ‘free and compulsory’ education to each and every citizen of this country, through provision of alternatives to online classes, but simultaneously ensuring the safety of each and every student. This can be achieved by training teachers to adapt to the new circumstances.Sangamitra is a 37-year-old homemaker and a resident of Kalgi village in Kalaburagi district in Karnataka. She has two children in classes 6 and 8, who study at a private school in Gotur, which is located nearby. Sangamitra’s husband, Murali, works as a mason and has a smartphone.Jayaram Satish, a farmer and RTE activist in Bashettihalli, Chikkaballapur, in Karnataka has a daughter in Class 7, who studies in the local government school. Jayaram said that unlike students in private schools, who have already started classes, studentsin his daughter’s school have been left behind."

    "headline": "ENCOUNTER: DEPRIVATION OF RIGHT TO LIFE UNDER ARTICLE 21CENTRE ISSUES GUIDELINES FOR DELIVERY OF ESSENTIAL GOODS THROUGH E-COMMERCELIABILITY ON ELECTION COMMISSION FOR ITS FAILURE TO STOP THE ABUSE OF COVID PROTOCOLIMPOSITION OF HINDI IN HARYANA COURTS",
    "data": "This article has been written by Nandini Srivastava of Manipal University Jaipur. This article is curated by Himanshu Raj of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.No one is unaware of the fact that a famous gangster, Vikas Dubey was encountered by the police officers a few days back. Upon hearing this news, people had mixed reactions. Some were relieved that finally, a man accused of 68 cases of murder and attempted murder is dead while some were exasperated on the thought that justice has not been served. Encounter or extrajudicial killing is not a new concept but it is a tool devised and used by police officials for a long time. This tool was practiced by the Maharashtra police to deal with the Mumbai underworld, it was used by Punjab police against those people who demanded Khalistan and has been widely used in the state of Uttar Pradesh since 2017. It is also evident that as the crime rates against women have increased in India, the people are constantly demanding to kill the accused at the earliest. The encounter of four men accused in the Hyderabad rape and murder case was widely celebrated in India but however appropriate it seems prima facie, it is not legally right.The Constitution of India, 1949 through Article 21 guarantees “No person shall be deprived of life or personal liberty except according to the procedure established by law.” and procedure adopted should be just, right and fair and not oppressive, fanciful and arbitrary. Procedure can only be just, right and fair when it is based on natural justice. Every person whether criminal or not has the right to natural justice but police encounters deprive them of it.Police can only harm or kill anyone in self – defence or to maintain peace and order but yet India has had numerous cases of encounters. India has no laws for regulating encounters but Supreme Court in the case of People’s Union of Civil Liberties v. State of Maharashtra has laid down certain guidelines for the investigation of encounter cases and they are as follows:Encounter deprives a person from his/her fundamental rights given under Article 21 but at the same time it divests the nation from truth as well. Police, though the protectors of the state at times might abuse their power in order to please and hide toxic actions of few powerful people and what better way to prevent the public from knowing the criminal nexus than encounter. The court in the case of Prakash Kadam v. Ramprasad Vishwanath Gupta also held that encounters by police officials are nothing more than cold blooded murder and in its judgment stated “Trigger happy policemen who think they can kill people in the name of ‘encounter’ and can get away with it should know that gallows await them”. Whenever police receive any intelligence report or tip – off regarding any activity or movement regarding to the commission of any grave criminal offence then it is required to report it either in the case diary or in any electronic form. When information is received through any higher authority then the same should be mentioned in the report without fail. In both the cases, details of the suspect and location should not be revealed.If firearms are used by the police which results in an encounter then an FIR should be registered and submitted to the Judicial Magistrate. If any police weapon is found related to the encounter then the same should be sent for forensic and ballistic test.Independent and impartial investigation of the encounter should be carried out either by the Crime Investigation Department (CID) or other police team. The team doing investigation should be headed by an officer who holds superior rank than those who are party to the encounter.The team while carrying out the investigation has to identify the victims and take their pictures for record. They need to find and preserve various evidence which include but not limited to blood – stained earth, hair, threads, weapons etc. Investigating team has to ascertain the reason, manner and location of the whole crime scene and along with that if possible should take its photograph or video of the location. It is imperative that they also record the time of death. Team has to send for chemical analysis the fingerprint of the deceased and of any person found on the location. Post mortem report should be conducted in the District hospital by at least two doctors out of whom one should be the head of the District hospital. The post mortem should be video graphed for record. At last, the team has to establish whether it is a natural death, accident, suicidal or homicide. If it is proved that death has been the result of a crime under IPC, 1860 then disciplinary action should be taken against the police officer and he should be immediately suspended.Imitation of the scene should be sent to the family of the officer and if they require service of lawyer or counselor then they should be offered the same. No promotion or award should be given to the officer immediately after the incident. Any such can only be given if it is proved that such gallantry is beyond doubt.It is not necessary to involve the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) in every single case. They need to get involved in only those cases where it seems that an impartial or independent investigation has not taken place though it is necessary to send information about the incident to NHRC as soon as possible. Six monthly statements of all the cases of police firing should be sent to the NHRC in every 6 months by the DGP’s.Any person injured should receive immediate medical assistance and his statement should be recorded either by the Medical or Magistrate officer. In case of death, the family should be informed and compensation should be given to them under Section 357 of CrPC.If the family of the deceased is under a belief that an impartial or independent investigation has not taken place then they can file a complaint to the Session judge."

    "headline": "FIXING ACCOUNTABILITY OF JUDICIAL MAGISTRATE (IN THE CONTEXT OF TAMIL NADU FATHER-SON CUSTODIAL DEATH)GULMEHAR KAUR-ABVP ROW: A CONSTITUTIONAL GRADIENTDisturbance, Disorder and Assault can never be a solution for bad JournalismEVOLUTION OF INDIAN LAW IN THE ERA OF DIGITALIZATION",
    "data": "This article is written by Muskaan Bangani from Mody University of Science and Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan, and curated by Anjeeta Rani of Chanakya National Law University, Patna.According to Oxford dictionary, the term torture means “The action or practice of inflicting severe pain or suffering on someone as a punishment or to force them to do or say something”, but what happened to Tamil Nadu’s P. Jeyraja and his son J. Fenix was nothing short of barbaric. Jeyraja was a 60-year-old man who lived in Sathankulam, a town near Thoothukudi in Tamil Nadu. He owned a mobile shop at Sathankulam. On 18th June 2020, a police patrol team while passing by Jeyraja’s shop at around 7.30 pm asked him to shut down, despite the deadline being 9:00 pm. Jeyraja made few critical remarks against the police patrol team for insisting shop owners shut their shops early. An auto driver informed the police about the said remark, and as a result, the police took Jeyraja into custody the very next day. His son, J Fenix, and his friends left for the police station after they informed him about his father being taken to the police station. On arrival, Fenix was asked to wait for several hours after which he saw that his father was being physically harassed by a police officer. An agitated Fenix questioned the officer and tried to stop the torture which led to him pushing the police officer to protect his aged father. Subsequently, the officers arrested him too. His friends were not allowed to meet both of them. There were 2 sub-inspectors and 2 constables in the torture team, and in total, 13 police officers were present during the entire incident. The friends of Fenix stated that they were tortured so brutally, that their screams were heard even 500 meters away from the station and they were tortured for more than three hours. Pery, Fenix’s sister, registered her statement saying that the police had stripped them naked and kept trashing them with batons, with such force that it ripped off the flesh from their genitals, back, and thighs and broke their bones. On 20th June 2020, the family members waited outside the police station till midnight, and after a while, they saw the two in very bad shape; they were bleeding incessantly. The police officers asked the family members to bring “dark coloured veshti and lungi” for the captives. Then they were taken to the Sathankulam government hospital. During 3 hours, their lungis were changed 4-5 times. After 3 hours at the hospital, both the son and the father were taken to Sathankulam Magistrate Court.The incident that happened at the court stunned everyone. The brother in law of Jeyraja stated that the Magistrate waved his hand from the first floor of the building as the police stood outside without even hearing the case. Then, both were sent to Kovilpatti sub-jail till the evening of 22nd June 2020, before they were shifted to a nearby hospital. Due to excessive bleeding and severe external and internal injuries from the alleged lock up torture, Fenix died late in the evening on 22nd June and Jeyraja died in the wee hours on 23rd June.After the news of the death of the father and son broke out in social media on 23rd June 2020, it led to a mass protest against the police officers and the Magistrate.A magistrate is the first point of contact for any litigant seeking justice at the district level, and like any other government servant, his primary duty is to serve the public and their interests. The responsibility of building up the case appropriately and understanding the matter lies on him so that the cause of justice is answered. The personalities, knowledge, judicial restraint, capacity to maintain dignity are the additional aspects that go into making the Court’s functioning successful.Article 22(2) of the Indian Constitution provides that each person who is arrested and detained in custody shall be produced before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours of such arrest and no one shall be detained in custody beyond the said period without the authority of a magistrate. The magistrate can pass an order of remand to authorize the detention of the accused in such custody as such Magistrate thinks fit, for a term not exceeding 15 days in the whole.In Sheela Barse vs State of Maharashtra (1983), the Hon’ble Supreme Court ruled that the arrested accused person must be informed by the magistrate about his right to be medically examined in terms of section 54 of Code of Criminal Procedure. The High court directed magistrates to ask the arrested person if he has any complaint of torture or maltreatment in police custody. It is the onus of the state to provide free legal aid to an indigent accused person.The judicial magistrates must not be spectators or mere recording machines, instead, they should be an active participant in the trial using his/her intellect to ascertain the truth. They must inform the accused of his fundamental right to seek legal counsel and also to inform the friends/family of the accused about the arrest.One of the cardinal principles of criminal law is that every accused is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. Hence, no one should be punished without a fair trial.The facts of the above case shed light on the fact that P. Jeyaraja and J. Fenix may have been alive today and recuperating in a hospital, had it not been for the sheer negligence and dereliction of duty by the Magistrate. Had he heard the merits of the case and acted with caution and discretion, the two would have been referred to a hospital for immediate treatment and not confined to die in prison, as they were. "

    "data": "This article is written by Bhavya Verma of JEMTEC, School of Law, Greater Noida and curated by Dheepika R of ICFAI Law School, Hyderabad.The World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020, announced that an outbreak of the viral disease COVID-19–first detected in Wuhan, China in December 2019–had reached the point of a global pandemic. Citing concerns about “the alarming rates of spread and intensity”, the WHO called on governments to take immediate and decisive measures to stop the virus from spreading.The scale and severity of the COVID-19 pandemic clearly rose to the level of a threat to public health which might justify restrictions on certain rights, such as those resulting from the imposition of quarantine or isolation restricting freedom of movement. At the same time, careful attention to human rights such as non-discrimination and principles of human rights such as transparency and respect for human dignity can foster an effective response in the midst of the turmoil and disruption that inevitably leads to times of crisis and limits the harms that may result from imposing overly broad measures that do not meet the criteria mentioned above.Under the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, adopted by most nations, everyone has the right to “the highest attainable standard of physical and mental health”. Governments are obliged to take appropriate measures to “prevent, treat and control of epidemic, endemic, occupational and other diseases”.In September 2018 the Supreme Court of India legalized homosexuality in India. The five-judge bench declared Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code to be unconstitutional and held that human sexuality cannot be limited to a binary.The judgment heralded a new dawn for personal freedom and was a major LGBT community victory. They possessed the same degree of dignity as other people. Yet the COVID-19 pandemic affected the LGBT community significantly.They struggle with lack of resources, stigma, and poor mental and physical health. The LGBT’s are already a vulnerable group and the pandemic has made their lives a little harder. International Transgender Rights groups are arguing that they have been denied healthcare due to global coronavirus lockdown restrictions.Two main steps to defeat COVID-19 are social distancing and the use of personal protection. But, since most transgender people are poor and live in small buildings, these protective steps are not enforced.Those who beg for their livelihood, or do sex work, are the worst affected because they have no income now. As a result, these areas are likely to be a hotbed for COVID-19 as they live in small houses in unhygienic conditions.During this lockdown, a transgender staying with an unsupportive family deal with stress, anxiety, and trauma especially those who have recently undergone surgery. Because of the lack of social acceptance for ages, they are likely to fall into the clutches of depression and so this pandemic has intensified their plight.Higher levels of anxiety, depression, and poor mental wellbeing have been related to habits adverse to their physical health including increased use of abuse of drugs, smoking, alcohol, self-harm, eating disorders, and suicidal thoughts. Sometimes they are exposed to verbal as well as physical violence due to lack of understanding and acceptance even by family members.The LGBT Foundation has received numerous complaints from trans-people that they are denied access to prescribed hormone injections, although the guidelines on essential services from the World Health Organization and the European Commission include medicines for the LGBT.A lot of NGO’s help them cope with this crisis. The Social Justice and Empowerment Ministry (MSJE) is working to empower the marginalized communities. On April 8, the Karnataka Government announced that transgender people would get it upfront for two months, and they would also be provided with free medicines.Four transgender people in Lakhimpur district also received free rations from the Assam Government. Chhattisgarh is the only State with a Transgender Welfare Board that works.Hence, the ability to adequate health care is a critically important universal human right and yet is being denied to transgender people worldwide. During times like today, with the COVID-19 pandemic, the implications of the right’s rejection are far-reaching. Discrimination leads to the systematic exclusion of the healthcare of transgender communities in India. Times of crisis is a test of the tolerance and acceptance of difference within society. While the rest of the world is battling the COVID-19 outbreak, the transgender community, particularly in India, continue to struggle through the layers of oppression and centuries of a separate quarantine placed on the outside of the conventional binary because of their gender identity. The need for the hour is to crack the stigma attached to the LGBT community and in this hour of crisis give them a helping hand."

The motivation behind criminalization is to take activities against open wrongs.In the previous years, the enactment has rolled out a few improvements in law, presenting definitions which are progressively detailed in their structure to characterize wrongdoing, one such case is the meaning of Rape, which has been expanded.There are a significant number of Penal Provisions made to condemn the good and open wrongs. Many revisions have been made in these arrangements, and additionally, options are made to broaden them. In any case, with the extension of criminal laws, the crime percentage is likewise expanding.The Centre ought to know that with the augmentation of criminalization the assortment of wrongdoings and their sorts are expanding. It’s acceptable that a few corrective laws rebuff the transgressor however the danger of discipline cannot put a mind to the extension of criminalization among society.There are laws made on general society and good wrongs, however, are they adequate. Numerous laws are not exact, and others are just written in the demonstrations which are not actualized at the grass-root level. There are escape clauses in the drafting of these laws which offer a favorable position to the transgressors to pick up from and spare oneself from the reformatory procedures.The excess of laws has prompted a place for over-criminalization which is the subject of conversation these days. India can’t manage the cost of more laws; it can’t deal with the current number of laws. The number of judges to hear the cases are extremely less. A ton of cases are pending and numerous individuals are carrying on with their life as Under Trial Prisoners, which is a danger to the current equity framework.Furthermore, social issues have likewise changed as they were sometime back when these laws were made. These issues incorporate enormous social issues like lack of education, destitution, strict clashes, adolescent misconduct, joblessness, prejudice, fear-based oppression and so forth these issues are consistently a subject of incredible conversation and a few discussions are additionally made on these issues however there is no exacting arrangement made on them.Criminalization is influenced by political variables. The ideological groups impact individuals to enjoy out of line rehearsals and to advance mobs among the nation, to satisfy their childish intrigue.Criminalization ought to be picked as the final hotel. As Mahatma Gandhi stated, “Rebuff the wrongdoing, not the hoodlums.” Mere rebuffing the crooks would not be an answer to the issue of rising crimes. The Centre ought to be given as to how to stop the rise of criminal intuition among individuals. The psychology of the criminal leaning individuals should be comprehended and steps ought to be taken to expel the reasons which prompt the event of criminal conduct among individuals.The administration has made numerous revisions in the laws identified with ladies, for example, Triple Talaq is abrogated. But is this an answer to all the issues?For Instance, Triple Talaq has been proclaimed unlawful by the zenith court yet other types of Talaq are being abused under Muslim law. Because the voice is raised against the Triple Talaq, does it offer an answer for all the issues? The criminalization is done uniquely on those exercises which are proclaimed as open and good wrongs; shouldn’t something be said about those unfair exercises against whose voice isn’t raised.Few other improper exercises are not even considered wrongdoing, for example, marital assault. What’s more, those arrangements that are made or altered are still being unjustly utilized.Considerably after the statement of Triple Talaq being invalid, still, its profession is made. The purpose is that numerous uneducated individuals don’t know about their privileges. They realize that regardless of whether they articulate Triple Talaq, it would not make a serious deal as the case will go to court and remain pending like other cases, and they can continue their life unreservedly until the choice is made.The most important factor which should have been presented is a ton, make the laws unbiased. Numerous laws must be utilized by ladies to guarantee their ideal for equity however the men on a similar look are not given any privilege under the laws. What’s more, along these lines, numerous times ladies abuse their privilege against men, which is an integrated explanation of criminalization.There are a few punitive arrangements in our enactment however the circumstance is as yet the equivalent and the crime percentage is likewise expanding step by step. This infers simply rebuffing the hoodlums would not result as a danger to stop it. The crooks should have been changed.The Reformative hypothesis ought to be received rather than Punitive Theory. Instruction ought to be given to make them aware of their privileges and even lawbreakers should be taught to change. They ought to be transformed into a superior individual. The other social issues, for example, destitution, un-training, joblessness, helpless employment, and so on.; ought to be given the significance.CONCLUSION:There is no point in making few laws on criminalization if they can’t keep an eye on the expanding pace of wrongdoing. Rather than making new laws, the laws ought to be diminished in tallying and their definition is made increasingly exact and precise in their usage so as not to allow the miscreants to get away and pick up preferences from its escape clauses. The abundance of laws would just prompt overcriminalization. The laws ought to be made severe and updated. It ought to be the obligation of each resident to keep them aware and the administration audit their usage."

    "headline": "DOES THE PROHIBITION OF THE SALE OF LIQUOR IN SOME STATES VIOLATE ARTICLE 19(1)(g)?JUSTICE FOR CONSUMERS IN INDIAThe Repercussions of Being an Indigent  ( An Indian Perspective)The Indian Legal Legend: Fali S Nariman",
    "data": "This article is written by Simran of Mody University of Science & Technology, Lakshmangarh, Rajasthan and curated by Dheepika R of ICFAI Law School, Hyderabad.Following the easing of restriction, India has entered the third phase of nationwide lockdown. Liquor stores opened all over the country after some long days of lockdown except the States of Bihar, Gujrat, Mizoram and Nagaland as well as union territory of Lakshadweep. The large crowd rushed towards the liquor stores after the lockdown 3.0 which helped the states in earning high revenue. Some States imposed duties and taxes on liquor and “Special Corona fee” in Delhi. Excise duty is the main source of income for the state.Some States imposed a total prohibition from the sale of liquor in the state to prevent people from queuing up in front of State-run liquor outlets during the COVID-19 outbreak. But this non availability of liquor led to suicide and consumption of homemade liquor which was hazardous for health. It also violates their fundamental right which is conferred in Part 3 of the Indian Constitution under Article 19(1) (g).Article 19 of the Constitution guarantees to the citizen their fundamental freedoms (a) Freedom of Speech and Expression (b) Freedom of Assembly (c) Freedom to form Associations or Unions or Co-operative Societies (d) Freedom to movement (e) Freedom to reside and to settle (g) Freedom of profession, occupation, trade or business; but it restricted by the Constitution itself by conferring upon the State a power to impose a law with reasonable restrictions as may be seen necessary in the interest of the society.The term “reasonable restriction” in Article 19 (6) means the limitation imposed on a person in the enjoyment of his right should not be of excessive nature as it implies the intelligent care and deliberation. As it strikes a proper balance between freedom guaranteed in Article 19 and the special control which is mentioned under Article 19 (6).Article 19(1) (g) talks about Freedom of profession, occupation, trade or business. However, the right to carry on a profession, trade or business is not unqualified; it can be restricted and regulated by an authority of law and the State can impose reasonable restrictions in the interest of the public.Trading of liquor is not a fundamental right:In Khoday Distilleries Ltd. v. State of Karnataka, ((2019) 4 SCC 376) the Supreme Court held the rights under Article 19 (1) are not absolute but qualified and the State is authorized under clause (2) to (6) of Article 19 to impose reasonable restriction on this right. A citizen has no fundamental right to trade or business in activities which are immoral and criminal in nature i.e. outside the commerce which is also known as res extra commercium.The restriction on the right to trade in liquor can be imposed not only by law enacted by the legislation but it can be imposed by any subordinate legislation as well. The State has exclusive rights regarding portable liquor. It can also be provided by the Executive as long as it is issued by the Governor of the State. Sometimes, people confuse the term “business” with “trade” as it is more comprehensive than the word “trade” since it includes manufacture while the word “trade” may not include ordinary.In the case, State of Tamil Nadu Rep. By Its Secretary Home, Prohibition & Excise Dept. & Ors v K.Balu (Civil Appeal Nos. 12164-12166 of 2016), the Supreme Court of India has ordered that there would be a ban on the sale of liquor within a distance of 500 meters from any national or state highways. The apex court modified its order stating an exemption within 220 meters of any highway for small towns or municipalities where the population of people will be less than 20,000. In the order, the Hon’ble Supreme Court has clearly stated that any hotel, bar or pubs serving alcohol will be included in the ban.Exceptions of prohibition on sale of liquor:Although, in the case State of Bombay v. F. N. Balsara (1951 AIR 318), the Supreme Court held that absolute prohibition of manufacture or sale of liquor is permissible and the only exception can be for medical preparation medicines.Conclusion: It is concluded that liquor is not an ordinary commodity, while it carries connotations of pleasure and sociability in the minds of many, but its harmful consequences outweigh the pros of its use. National monitoring systems need to be developed to keep track of alcohol consumption and its consequences, and to raise awareness amongst the public and policy-makers. It is up to governments and concerned citizens to curb the situation by proper implementation of laws that minimize the harm caused by liquor. Thus, the fundamental rights which are given under Article19 (1) (g) are provided to carry the business which is for the benefit of the public and society as a whole. The State has the power to prohibit the manufacture, sale, possession, distribution and consumption because it is a dangerous article of consumption and also because the directive principle contained in Article 47 of the Constitution, except when it is used for medicine purposes. States can create a monopoly in such business either by itself or by any agency. The creation of monopoly rights in a few persons is not unreasonable. Thus, in Cooverji v. Excise Commissioner (1954 AIR 220),it was pointed out by this exception that a law which creates a monopoly to sell liquor in favour of a few persons was held valid.Once sale of liquor is permitted by a State Government, every citizen has a fundamental right to apply for permission to trade in liquor. However, “It shall be open for the concerned State Government to consider non-direct sale including on-line sale/home delivery of liquor to facilitate social distancing”, the Supreme Court ordered in a petition filed by one Guruswamy Nataraj to facilitate social distancing."

There is no duty more important than ensuring that their rights are respected, that their welfare is protected, that their lives are free from fear and want and that they can grow up in peace.”- Kofi AnnanFrom the Seventh Five-Year Plan onward, the judiciary, especially the Hon’ble Supreme Court have played a significant role in upholding children’s rights. The following cases are some of the most important examples of social action litigation for children, each of which was a milestone in the process of ensuring children’s rights. Bharwada Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai v. State of Gujarat, AIR 1983 SC 753: The accused, a middle-aged man, had confined his daughter’s two friends around the age of 10, who had come to visit the daughter in his house and raped them. The trial court found the accused to have been guilty of rape, violating modesty and wrongful confinement. The High Court upheld the conviction though raising the charge for attempting rape from rape. On the basis that slight inconsistencies in the facts were not significant, the Supreme Court upheld the trial court’s judgment. The Apex Court also observed that in rape cases, there is no need for corroboration of conviction. For later decisions, this decision was relied upon to obtain prosecution when there were no other eye-witnesses for support of the victim’s evidence.Laxmikant Pandey v. Union of India, AIR 1984 SC 469: The Hon’ble Supreme Court laid down a few doctrines governing the rules for the implementation of inter-country adoption laws. The case was filed by an advocate, Laxmikant Pandey who addressed the court, alleging that social organisations and voluntary agencies engaged in the work of offering Indian children to foreign parents are indulged in malpractices.Sheila Barse v. Union of India, AIR 1986 SC 1883: The Apex Court issued a number of guidelines regarding the physically and mentally disabled children as well as abandoned or destitute children lodged for ‘safe custody’ in various country jails. The court further held that ‘In so far as an accused child is concerned with an offense punishable by imprisonment not exceeding 7 years, a period of 3 months from the date of filing of the complaint or filing of the First Information Report is the maximum time allowed for investigation and a period of 6 months from the filing of the charge sheet as a reasonable period within which the child’s trial must be completed. If that is not done, it would be liable to quash the prosecution against the child. Every government of any State shall give effect to this principle or norm in respect of any future case.’C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu, JT 1990 SC 263: On child labour, the Court held that Articles 24, 39(e) and 9(f), 41 and 47 required the State to abolish child labour, thus maintaining children’s healthy growth. Under Article 32, the Government of India shall take legislative, administrative, social and educational steps to ensure that the child is safe from hazardous exploitation and healthy growth. In the domestic domain, the Court held that there are many pieces of legislation such as the Child Labour (Prohibition and Regulation) Act, 1986 (the Act), which protect children from abuse. The Court, however, took note of the fact that deprivation compels a family to force their child into dangerous work. The Court held that the statutory purpose behind the Act to ensure a child’s safe development was also important to be fulfilled.Vishal Jeet v. Union of India, 1990 (3) SCC 318: In the instant case, the Apex Court in order to eradicate the problems of child prostitution issued the following directions to the State governments and Union Territories:Instruct concerned law enforcement authorities to take effective and prompt steps to eliminate child prostitution under the current legislation.Take action to provide adequate, rehabilitative housing.Create a separate advisory committee made up of relevant government officials, sociologists, criminologists, women/child welfare/voluntary social organizations to make recommendations for the eradication of child prostitution; and victim care, safety, diagnosis, growth and recovery initiatives.Unnikrishnan v. State of Andhra Pradesh, 1993 (1) SC 645: The Supreme Court held that the right to basic education is implied by the fundamental right to life (Article 21 of the Constitution of India) when read in conjunction with the directive principle on education (Article 41 of the Constitution of India). The Court held that the parameters of the right must be understood in the sense of the Directive Principles of State Policy, including Article 45 which stipulates that the State shall endeavour to provide free and compulsory education for all children under the age of 14, within a period of ten years from the commencement of the Constitution.Delhi Domestic Working Women’s Forum v. Union of India, 1995 SCC (1) 14: Six young domestic workers were brutally harassed, assaulted and raped by Army personnel on a train from Ranchi to Delhi. Acknowledging the challenges encountered by the victims in the judicial process, this judgment provided some guidelines to be followed when dealing with sexual offenses such as:Proper legal aid should be given to complainants in sexual harassment cases.Legal assistance must be provided at the police station.It would be the responsibility of the police to remind the victim of their right to representation before any questions were asked about her.A list of advocates who are willing to act in such cases will be kept for victims at the police station.The lawyer shall be appointed at the court at the earliest possible time upon application by the police.Victim anonymity must be maintained in all rape cases, as far as possible.An appropriate and equitable financial compensation must be provided to the victims of rape.The court shall award compensation for the injured, whether or not a conviction has occurred."

    "headline": "The History Of Sedition And Its Relevance In Today’s worldKINDER-MISHANDLING AND MENTAL HEALTHChief Justice of India Dipak Misra Bars Senior Lawyers From Orally Mentioning Their Cases in Supreme CourtWill Artificial Intelligence replace Judging?",
    "data": "This article is written by Anushka Sharma from Delhi Metropolitan Education, GGSIPU and is curated by Rasveen Kaur Kapoor, Indore Institute of Law.Sedition is a conduct or speech which incites people to reel against the authority of the state or monarch. It was stated in the case Nazir Khan v. State of Delhi, “The line dividing preaching disaffection towards the Government and legitimate political activity in a democratic set-up cannot be ascertained with precision. The demarcating line is thin and wavy.” Sedition basically revolves around the fact that enrages people with huge governance discontent and outrage and hence if not handled constitutionally can pose a problem.Initially, sedition was not a part of the Indian Penal Code which came into force in the year 1860. It was incorporated in 1870 in chapter-IV of the Indian Penal Code which deals with offences against the State. It came in the context to the rising Wahhabi Movement which aimed to overthrow the British rule. In Macaulay’s draft penal code (1837-39), Section- 113 dealt with Sedition which was omitted by the Indian Penal Code of 1860 and was again added back as Section 124 A by Act 27 in 1870. This section was amended by the Indian Penal Code of 1898. The amendment replaced the single explanation and incorporated three separate explanations for this section.It was first applied in 1891 in Bnagobasi case. Bal Gangadhar Tilak was booked thrice under this law.The section was amended quite a few times in the year 1937, 1948, and 1950, constitutional changes, by, the Government of India Act, 1935, the Independence Act of 1947 and the Indian Constitution of 1950 and no this section read as:“Whoever, by words, either spoken or written, or by signs, or by visible representation, or otherwise, brings or attempts to bring into hatred or contempt, or excites or attempts to excite disaffection towards, 102 the Government estab­lished by law in 103 [India], shall be punished with 104 [im­prisonment for life], to which fine may be added, or with impris­onment which may extend to three years, to which fine may be added, or with fine. Explanation 1—The expression “disaffection” includes disloyalty and all feelings of enmity. Explanation 2—Comments expressing disapprobation of the meas­ures of the Government with a view to obtain their alteration by lawful means, without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this section. Explanation 3.—Comments expressing disapprobation of the admin­istrative or other action of the Government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection, do not constitute an offence under this section.]”Sedition existed in the Indian Penal Code before India got its Independence. The colonial master used to penalise anybody who tried to overthrow the state.The implementation of the aforesaid law presently in the hands of government and its officials at large, has taken a different embodiment; instead of actually punishing people, who are misusing it, it is inciting terror in the minds and hearts of the general public at large, taking away their freedom of speech and expression. As per the Supreme Court interpretation of Section 124A, says that it has to be against the state, not against the government. It also stated that there has to be a direct incitement to violence for it to be considered as sedition.As per the data provided by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 194 cases of sedition have been filed since the passing of the CAA on December 11, 2019 than in the last three years put together. The law has sometimes been used to bully ad terrorise people which is eventually leading to breach of their freedom of speech and expression guaranteed to them by Article 19 of the Constitution.The author believes that the misuse of Sedition Law should be looked after and serious action should be taken against the ones actually misusing it for their own benefit. Sedition Law shall be interpreted and applied in consonance with the due rationale behind its enactment and the constitutional virtues of the country at large shall be respected and borne in the minds of both the government as well as the officials thereto. India being the largest democracy in the world shall sustain its prodigious and equalitarian virtues enshrined in the Constitution of India. "

    "headline": "The Pre-Dominance of Child Pornography In IndiaTKDL: A REVOLUTIONARY IMPACT ON THE IPR INDUSTRYIS IT TIME THAT INDIA ABOLISHES DEATH PENALTY?UIGHUR MUSLIMS IN CHINA- IS THE BIG DATA PROGRAM TARGETING THEM?",
    "data": "This article has been written by Aaryaki Rana from Chanakya National Law University, Patna, and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.A human’s pleasure-seeking abilities and mediums are mainstream and widely available in today’s era. There is no general litmus test for gauging the erotic feel of a particular content, that is to say, what may be sexual for one person may not be the same for another. One of the most prevalent modes of sexual indulgence for today’s generation is seen via the usage and exploitation of pornography. Pornography has no widely accepted definition, owing to the fact that what seems pornographic to one person shall not necessarily seem so to another. However, ‘pornography’ is usually referred to as representations designed to arouse a person and ultimately give them sexual pleasure, by way of them reading, watching, hearing or handling such content. Most often, pornography is portrayed as one of the never-ending ills of today’s puritanical society. This society’s evidence of moral decay is available to users through basic broadband access or a musty video camera. The idea of pornography is not a modern thought. Many researchers think that evolution has inclined humans to visual arousal than just a means of reproducing. The diversity in the pornographic material and content throughout history suggests that the human species are keen on images of sexual representation.As early as 30,000 years ago, Paleolithic people carved large breasted, thick-thighed figurines of pregnant women out of stone and wood. These Venus figurines were either intended for sexual arousal or as a fertility symbol or religious icons. In India, the ‘Kama Sutra’ was seen as a sex-manual and a relationship handbook. In the 1800s, the idea of pornography was properly given shape, by way of printing erotic novels. These novels were printed since mid 1600s in France. Technology drove the innovation for pornography. It was not until 1839 that Louis Daguerre invented the daguerreotype, a primitive form of photography. The pornographers almost immediately followed suit and appropriated this new technology. The videography followed a similar path. By 1896, the filmmakers in France has delved into the pornography genre and directed silent clips, where the actresses would perform a strip tease. For the longest time, this stag pornography was standing in the society. However, in the 1970s the public showing of explicit films was finally accepted. The internet access and the invention of digital cameras stooped the obstacles to a zilch, and pornography shooting had become a non-professional piece of video content. This gained traction due to the speedy advancement in the area of technology and the scheme of public affordability and accessibility. However, pornography has always been a social stigma since time immemorial and in today’s period, it has gone to the extent of being lethal for the opposite gender and minors. Before, that is discussed, it is important to throw light on the present laws and rules that try to keep pornography exploitation in check.Sections 67, 67A and 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 are the relevant provisions in our country. Section 67 states punishment for the publication or transmission of obscene material in electronic form. Section 67A criminalises the publication or transmission of any material depicting sexually explicit act or conduct in electronic form. It also adds for situations wherein a person or group of person forces or influences another person to publish or transmit such content over the Internet. Section 67B, specifically discusses online child pornography and mentions various acts that are considered as an offence-Sections 292 and 293 of the Indian Penal Code describe pornography in any form as illegal. This section states that any obscene content sold, distributed, imported or exported would be held as an offence, A child is any person below the age of 18 years. The internet has served as a medium to allow the abusers to abuse children sexually, globally. Pornography in India has become a big market for objectifying sexual intercourse between individuals, who look to indulge in sexual acts. However, what stands and interests the pornography audiences the most today remains child pornography. It does not come as a surprise to see paedophiles establishing their connections with young, impressionable teenagers by way of social media and win their confidence and defraud those helpless children by forcing them into performing favours for them. During this difficult time of the pandemic, where the attention of the nation has shifted to more substantial and weighty problems, the distribution and availability of child pornography is seen as downright inhuman and horrid. Recently, the Maharashtra government reported that 133 FIRs had been registered and 46 people were arrested by the Maharashtra police for cases related to child pornography, since the nationwide lockdown was enforced. This spike in the child pornographic content consumption shows the existence of the alarming number of paedophiles, child rapists and child pornography addicts online. This becomes an extremely unsafe environment for children who depend on the internet for the most part of their lives. The threat of cyber trafficking is booming, and such people who try to lower a child’s inhibitions with the objective of sexual abuse go unnoticed for the fact of being secured in the comfort of their online platforms. It becomes pivotal for our government to provide for a wider definition of child pornography and for stringent laws and regulations in the light of such circumstances and events. In furtherance to the same objective, a Parliamentary House Committee headed by Rajya Sabha member Jairam Ramesh has recommended multi-pronged recommendations to tackle the hazard that is child pornography. In spite of everything that is being said and done, our country must try to modernise in terms of sexual education and orientation and propagate the idea and thought of safe intercourse and also educate our citizens for them to gain a broader perspective on what is ethically and lawfully correct and incorrect. Once the thought process of all generations have been changed fundamentally, social perils and evils such as child pornography will be condemned by the society at large and will be curbed at the community level by way of awareness. Publication or transmission of material depicting children in sexually explicit conduct or act, or forcing/influencing the same;Creating text or images showing child pornography;Collecting, searching, browsing, downloading, promoting, advertising, distributing, or exchanging any material showing child pornography in electronic form;Facilitating abuse of children online;Enticing or inducing children to an online relationship with other children for sexually explicit acts; orRecording sexually explicit act with children."

    "headline": "Secret Ballot- A Necessity for Maintaining DemocracyALL INDIA KASHMIRI SAMAJ AND OTHERS V. UNION OF INDIA & ANOTHERWhat is the impact of online court proceedings with respect to litigants and lawyers?Should the Death Penalty be Abolished in India?",
    "data": "This article is written by Riya Kaushik studying L.L.B. in Geeta Institute of Law and curated by Naman Jain, Bennett University, Greater Noida studying BBA-LLBSecret Ballot is a method of voting, in which each person writes the name of their choice of the candidate in the election on a piece of paper and put that paper in a closed ballot so that the secrecy of voting is maintained and none can determine whom the other person voted. In this way, the secrecy persists in the secret ballot system.The secret ballot was designed to eliminate the biasedness in voting and to solve the problem of privacy. The Supreme Court of India has agreed that the Secret Ballot is the Cornerstone of free and fair elections. The court also recommended the postulating of constitutional democracy. S. 94 of the Representation of the People Act gives the voter the privilege to maintain secrecy about his choice and whom he has voted. Moreover, it grants the right of confidentiality to him.In my point of view, Secret Ballot is the core method to achieve a fair democracy. Nowadays, the viewpoint of the voter is being manipulated by the various unfair practices used by the political parties. They try to influence the choice of the voter by giving them various incentives and sometimes coercive activities are also used. After the casting of vote, they try to threat the voter and by coercive activities try to ask that whom they had voted.In such a scenario, it is essential to provide voters a platform or a method through which the secrecy of their vote can be maintained. It would help the voters freely cast their votes without any biasedness or any threat.It is the duty of a nation to ensure that the right of the voters should be maintained by the secrecy of the ballot so that the possibility of any voter being forced to disclose whom he had voted can be protected. The above would act as a positive constraint, and it is also the policy of the law. The constitution of India also secures this right of voters i.e., to choose their representatives freely. The constitution guarantees a free and fair election policy. Furthermore, the election commission must maintain this policy.However, sometimes the voter voluntarily waves this privilege of non-disclosure. No one can stop him from doing so, nor can anyone file a complaint against him for doing so. Also, there is no provision under which a complaint can be filed against the person who forced him to disclose his vote. These are the major loopholes of the legislation that hinder the way to achieve a fair democracy.Nowadays, the Electronic Voting Machine has replaced the Secret ballot system. However, the Electronic Voting Machine system is also not free from loopholes. The political parties have complained several times that the electronic voting machine system is not correct and was misused by the parties to get results in their favor. It is also not correct to say that the Secret ballot system is free from these loopholes. The probability of misusing the system of voting by any of the modes remains the same. However, a mix of both systems can prove to be efficient. While drafting a comparison, it is evident that the Secret Ballot is better than the Electronic Voting Machine as the electronic system can be hacked and manipulated, leading to various errors and frauds. However, in the secret ballot system, the possibility of these frauds is less as compared to the electronic voting machine.The fundamental of a democratic country is that it should give citizens the right to choose their representative freely, and the secret ballot system ensures this free and fair right of the voter. So, for maintaining Democracy in India, a secret ballot is of utmost importance.The reality that the secret ballot is also affected by the manipulation and fraud in the voting system is grave. Therefore, there is a need to analyze the flaws and formulate preventive measures efficiently. The election commission needs to combat these problems and try to initiate the steps against unfair competitive practices in elections by the parties to give the voters free right and make the democracy fully vibrant. The fundamental right of the voter to free and fair elections must be ensured. "

    "headline": "BLACK AGE STORY OF INDIAN DEMOCRACY: EMERGENCY AND IT’S IMPACT ON LEGAL COMMUNITYFLAWS IN ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TECHNIQUESNew Governor of West Bengal – Sr. Adv. Jagdeep DhankharCRZ Violation: SC orders status quo",
    "data": "This article is written by Samta Sharma from JIMS, School of Law, Greater Noida and curated by Shruti Chaudhary from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.Undoubtedly, every nation’s government has some or the other defects in it, and Indian History has proved it right by experiencing the black phase of ‘Emergency’. ‘Emergency’, a word through which our nation’s 45 years old history is attached to. It has taught us repeatedly that either a nation can stand together in an emergency or can just perish apart.A nation is an entity that holds number of lives together and more than a nation, it’s the constitution which is considered as the most purest rule book of a country. A constitution that guarantees justice, and equal rights to its citizens is not less than a ‘Geeta’ to a hindu, ‘Quran’ to a muslim and ‘Bible’ to a Christian.Emergency can be defined as a serious, unexpected and a dangerous situation which requires immediate action and can even possess an immediate risk to life, health, property and environment. Indian democracy has experienced 3 periods of National Emergency in its history i.e. from 1975 to 1977. And here arises a pertinent question that, was imposing emergency in India a right step?This article will further cover the darkest phase of our Indian history (i.e. Emergency) and its impact on legal community.In a country where terrorist violence, man-made and natural disasters are considered as the most numb sensibilities, there can still be incidents related to human deaths because of some unreasonable politics between the ruling and opposition parties. Indira Gandhi, our Former Prime Minister was the main character of the whole black story of Indian Democracy that spurred the whole emergency situation out of proportion. Undoubtedly, every country’s natives are depended on their respective government in some or the other way but what if the system itself is in prejudice?The Emergency is remembered as the darkest period of Indian Democracy as it threatened both the Indian constitution as well as the legal system in different ways. It was on June 12, 1975 when Rajnarayan, a candidate of opposition party filed a petition against Indira Gandhi raising few allegations regarding misuse of powers and machinery of the government. Therefore, the Hon’ble Supreme Court cancelled the elections and barred the Former Prime Minister from contesting elections for next 6 years. Soon after the incident, Gandhi tried to reach the Supreme Court but the SC adjudged that she could not stand as an MP until the final verdict. It was after this time Indira Gandhi asked the then president to declare an emergency. And this is how the poorly built government opened the doors to greater instability and chaos. India’s constitution, which is said to be the lengthiest constitution of the world, in 1975, followed the provision to eliminate the fundamental rights of every individual of the state during the emergency. It even included the elimination of ‘Right to Life’, which is the most essential right possessed by an individual in a free democracy like India.Politics became a very dirty game at that time in which the whole nation was trapped into. “One may have freedom, yes, but freedom does not mean walking on the wrong side of the road, paralyzing the duly elected government,” Indira Gandhi explained while locking up thousands of her opponents and affecting more and more people’s lives. It was a common opinion across the world that Indian government at that time was one of the poor founding which gave the peaceful democracy a perfect storm to crash the nation as a whole.It is crystal clear that in such unsafe environment, a constitutional crisis at that time was very apparent. It was not just that, in the period of emergency almost every quarter of nation experienced shockwaves. Most of the media and newspapers were under the wrath of emergency. The emergency declared by Indira Gandhi undoubtedly left measureless stains on the Indian history. The directors of the leading newspapers and magazines who played a major role in an individual’s day to day life were also forcefully suppressed and hence it turned out into a dangerous, biased game for all the citizens. As a result many of the newspaper editors went on protests. Many of the opposition parties were arrested for no reason. The wrath didn’t even spare doctors. In such a prejudiced period, where all the quarters were in the trap of emergency, the legal profession was also not an exception to this. In this time, the advocates and judges who do not toe to government’s line were punished. The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India heard the infamous case of ADM Jabalpur during the emergency. In addition to this, there were arbitrary transfers of non-compliant judges, to punish them. Apart from this, emergency also experienced a great loas in the legal profession because of the loss of great advocates and additional Solicitor General like ‘Mr. Fali Nariman’. Similarly, the current law minister, ‘Shri Ravi Shankar Prasad’ was also arrested during that period. In addition to this, Late Shri Ram Jethmalani’s house was also raided.Everything was going according to the government and the government was outrageously suppressing the different sectors of the society by misusing their powers in the name of emergency. As a result, Indira Gandhi stood at the top of an unsound government and proved to be their soul leader. Thus, the answer to the above pertaining question is, the step taken by the Former Prime Minister will never be appreciated. One cannot misuse their powers just to hide their realities under the carpet. Every country’s government has some holes but Indian History has proved that it can go beyond that. Though apart from unfortunate incidents, there were also many positive changes that took place, the bar stood united against the imposition of emergency. Thankfully the emergency did not last forever and was nullified after 21 months. The government machinery has now made many laws and amendments for avoiding such conditions in the future that can create such horrific circumstances for its citizens. Fortunately, the nation is now exercising all the rules and laws rightly, and has proved that ‘India is not Indira’. The author does not wish to offend anyone’s personal sentiment.

    "data": "This article is written by Samta Sharma from Guru Gobind Singh Indraprastha University and curated by Shruti Chaudhary from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.In today’s digital age, there are wide range of inventions that are made for the comfort & smart solution of the population. These new inventions also include ‘Electronic Documentation’, which provides a person with much wider spectra than paper documentation. As managing paper documents is turning out to be a new problem nowadays and also in today’s pandemic-stricken time, the idea of paper work is drooping everywhere. As a result, many sectors are adopting the digital approach at a very steady pace to manage their time & reduce the use of paper to store these documents in a highly efficient and secure manner. It indeed helps in saving the economy and environmental conservation but when we talk about E-documentation, it undoubtedly includes electronic signatories too and subsequently a pertinent question arises that do these documents really contain any authenticity ?This article will further focus on examining, how an E-documentation is valid & done under statutory framework of Indian Law.Provisions regarding E-signature under IT ActIn India, the validity or laws of E-signature are covered under the Information Technology Act 2000, which is enhanced with hybrid concept of electronic signature which is based on UNCITRAL Model Law on Electronic Signatures 2001.An E- signature allows a person to send his consent/approval on an electronic document by saving his time & money. The purpose of electronic signature is similar to that of traditional signature, the only difference is that the person himself does not have to be present over there. According to the IT Act, electronic signatures are legally valid in India. It also focuses on uplifting the safety & security standards of the records.Let us understand more about the validity of E-signature in India.Statutory requirements of E-signatureThe government of India has recognized E-signature as the most assured and secured kind of signature. However under the IT Act an electronic signature would have to be reliable and specified under the second schedule of the Act. Though there are different types of signatures. However, not all of them are secure to use. Only the techniques notified in the second schedule can be used as a valid electronic signature. It covers two different types of signature recognition under IT Act.Electronic signatures that combine Aadhar with eKYC service are the first kind of signatures accepted under Information Technology act. Only the signer who has an Aadhar could go for online e-signature service for signing documents online. The eKYC service can be anything, for eg. OTP , which is commonly used in India. A user just needs an access to mobile phone and a web application for completing the process of signature.Digital form of signature is the second valid type of signature accepted under IT Act. Digital signatures are created with the asymmetric cryptosystem and hash function and are declared as valid and legal under IT Act. In asymmetric cryptosystem, there are a pair of keys. These keys are unique for every user and helps them in creating an e-signature. Users could get a digital signature from a reliable Certifying Authority (CA).The CA provides a digital certificate that covers the user’s personal information like his name, the public key and the expiry date of the certificate. In some cases the users could also get a USB token for signing a document. The USB token contains a personal PIN that will only be visible to the signer.Also, Section 3A(2) of The Information Technology Act, 2000 determines the reliability of technique used for electronic signature.The criteria for valid E- SignaturesThe Information Technology Act introduced an important law for E-signature by making an amendment in 2008. The amendment resulted in the addition of the definition of ‘electronic signature’. Section 2(a) of the act defines ‘electronic signature’ as:“An electronic signature is defined as the authentication of electronic records by subscribers through electronic techniques.” Now according to the Information Technology Act, e-signature is required to satisfy certain criteria for its legitimacy.The criteria is outlined as follows:However, there are certain documents which cannot be signed electronically. The Information Technology Act, has laid down some details about those documents that cannot be signed electronically under IT Act, 2000:Offences associated with Electronic SignatureFor every wrongdoer, there are punishments laid down under all Indian law. Similarly IT Act also covers some of the punishments for wrongdoers who create any felony related to electronic signature. Some of them are:ConclusionThe objective of a signature is to mark the authenticity of a writing or to bind it once the consent is given, which was earlier a very time-consuming process as it included shipping, faxing, scanning & filing. But after electronic signatures were legally recognized by the IT Act 2000, it has undoubtedly made signings an easy task for everyone and has finally fulfilled the current need of digital inventions like electronic signature.Based on the above discussion, it clearly mentions the rules to get an easy and guarded access to the process of E-signature. Section 3A(2) & similar other sections have certainly handled the art of protecting the information.And finally the discussion focused on an outlined process of offences which will indeed help in decreasing the cybercrime cases and spread the awareness towards the cyber-terrorists about the consequences of attempting any unlawful or illegitimate activity. Since E-signatures have been accepted and declared by the government of India as the most secure & legal process, it is now becoming a more reliable automated process for the population of India.Electronic Signature combining Aadhaar with eKYC service:Digital Signature:There should be a unique ID linked to the E-signature of the person who is signing the document.There should be an Audit Trail with the E-signature of the signer, only then it will be declared as legitimate.The changes attached to the E-signature or document should be discernible.The signatory should have a complete control over the data used to generate E-signature.A certifying authority, who is acknowledged by Controller of Certifying Authorities (CCA) always issues a digital signature certificate.Handwritten negotiable instruments except cheques.Handwritten contract for sale.Sale and purchase contracts (Real estate documents).Handwritten trust deeds documents.Handwritten power of attorney.Offences associated with E-signature are mainly related to identity theft (Section 66 C lays down the punishment)Fake electronic signature certificate.Misrepresentation of the material fact in order to generate any E-signature (Section 71 deals with the misrepresentation of the material fact).Publication of E-signature certificate which is not issued by certifying authority (Section 73).Creation of E-signature for some fraudulent activity. (Section 74)."

    "headline": "POLICE BRUTALITY: IT NEEDS TO BE STOPPEDDO’S AND DON’TS WHILE ON AN INTERNSHIPWHICH ARE THE MOST BRUTAL PANCHAYATS IN INDIA?Senior Advocate Jethmalani wants Mamta Banerjee to be the Next Prime Minister of India",
    "data": "This article is written by Kashish Goyal from Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan, and curated by Shruti Chaudhary from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.At the beginning of the ongoing lockdown owing to the COVID-19 pandemic, when strict rules were laid down regarding the lockdown to be followed by everyone, the people who were not following the rules were beaten up by the cops with lathi and sticks. It is understandable that the rules should be strictly followed but those people who only stepped out of their homes for buying the essential goods were also beaten up by the police brutally, also leading to the death of some persons. There have been many incidents in which the cops have acted beyond reasonable action. For this, upper responsible authority shall make laws with restrictions for the police authority to deal with such situations accordingly.The cops mostly deal with the accused as if they are offenders and their offense has already been declared by the judge. Those Prisoners who are in custody are also tortured by the police, time and again.If we talk about justice, then in relation to the brutality, the public more often than not justifies brutality by saying that the punishment should be given to such criminals. However, how can the constables who are hired by the authority torture them brutally before the judgment is being delivered?Each criminal has a right to live with dignity, even in case if someone breaks the law or any rule. He/she shall be punished but he/she has some fundamental rights which should not be violated while giving punishment. It was held in the case of Sheela Barse v. State of Maharashtra that “the right of the prisoner in custody or jail is included under Article 14 and 19 of the Indian constitution.”Given below is the brief outline of the recent police brutality case (Jayaraj and Fenix case) that has gained attention and public outcry in the last few days.The case pertains to the father-son duo of Jayaraj and Fenix who were allegedly mercilessly killed because of being the victims of violation in police custody.On 18th June 2020, Jayaraj and Fenix, father and son respectively, had a verbal argument over defying curfew that was in place for controlling COVID-19. The next day, the police took Jayaraj to the police station for an inquiry. After this, when his son Fenix got to know about this, he went to the police station immediately to take some answers but the police replied that they just called him for the inquiry. Even after trying for 24 hours, Fenix was not allowed to meet Jayaraj. On the contrary, the police also arrested fenix and kept both of them in custody, for the sole reason that they kept their shop open till late at night. This case made a remarkable history in Tamil Nadu. Both Jayaraj and Fenix were gravely assaulted by the police and even sodomized in custody. Although according to The Times of India, on June 20 2020, the police took them to a local hospital for a mandatory checkup to present them before the magistrate. The two were allegedly unfit and required serious medical treatment for the injuries they suffered at the hands of the police but the hospital discharged them. However, they succumbed to the injuries and died eventually. It has been claimed by Fenix’s lawyer that during the time of custody they were physically as well as sexually assaulted by the police.In another case of the Tirunelveli district, a person was taken at the police station to produce an original document of the bike. After he failed to produce a document, he was thrashed, assaulted, and stripped for an hour and rendered him unable to walk, requiring serious medical treatment.There have been multiple complaints against the brutality of the police but these complaints had not been taken seriously and servitude of justice appears to be a far-fetched idea. A collective voice should be raised by the people against such happenings and there should be a campaign through which awareness can spread.Many questions have been raised about the outrageous and brutal behaviour of the police officers pertaining to the deaths of Jayaraj and Fenix.The question is whether it is a crime to brutally assault because of the breakdown of lockdown rule? India does not only need the suspension of the cops or the police officers but there is a dire need to bring a change in the system, to make the police officers more accountable and answerable.As per the Indian Annual report of Torture, in India, more than five custodial deaths are reported every day. This problem is not new. It has become a continuous chain of custodial deaths nowadays. And the Tamil Nadu government is not taking any appropriate action without the order of a higher authority. The guidelines which are mentioned in the police manuals need to be strictly followed and implemented especially regarding the interrogation and lawbreakers. Even after weeks of committing of custodial deaths, the officers responsible are mostly not punished. The investigation procedure of our country is too slow, which is one of the main reasons why justice is served decades later if it does because the matter which should be investigated at that particular time is being investigated after a long time because there are already many cases that are pending in courts.CONCLUSIONIt is not the duty of any particular authority to provide justice; the duty, in general, lies with the society. If there is cooperation between the public and the supreme authority for any particular offense, justice will be served as soon as possible. Because when a collective voice is raised, it puts pressure on the authority to deal with the situation.The rules and regulations which are made for the police and cops to be followed by them while they are on the duty, should be implemented properly and if these rules are violated, there shall be provisions with consequences proportional to the violation committed. In certain circumstances, it becomes necessary for the authority to adopt drastic measures but there should always be a limit."

    "data": "This article is written by Aaryaki Rana of Chanakya National Law University, Patna, and curated by Naman Jain, Bennett University, Greater Noida.“If men could get pregnant, abortion would be a sacrament.” – Florynce KennedyThe women of our country have always faced the tyranny of our long-standing patriarchal society. It is for impediments and concerns such as gender inequality, health care, income gap, and social disparities that women have to pull through and struggle for their rights every day of their existence. Despite the era of globalization and more than 30 years of liberal legislation, our country faces the predicament of women safety and access to safe abortion care.According to Oxford Dictionaries, abortion means “The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks. According to Oxford Dictionaries, abortion means “The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks. According to Oxford Dictionaries, abortion means “The deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks”According to Oxford Dictionaries, abortion means “the deliberate termination of a human pregnancy, most often performed during the first 28 weeks.”According to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971, abortion means an untimely termination of the foetus. In India, the pregnancy of a woman can be terminated until 20 weeks under the MTP Act, 1971. If after the prescribed legal period for an abortion in India, an abortion takes place, then it is called foeticide. Abortion can be carried out in two ways-Earlier, abortion of any kind, whether voluntary or involuntary was forbidden and considered immoral, until the landmark judgment of the US Supreme Court Roe v. Wade. After this judgment, abortion was made legal and was considered as one of the essential rights under the fundamental rights. In India, the issues regarding abortion have been subjected to several debates and discussions, but abortion is still considered as an inhumane and criminal act. The Indian Penal Code1860 deals with the laws of abortion under S. 312 to S. 316.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act 1971has allowed a little more relaxation for a pregnant woman. This Act is formulated by the Shah Committee appointed by the Government of India in 1966 that carried out a comprehensive review of socio-cultural, legal, and medical aspects of abortion. Interestingly, the Medical Termination Act uses the term ‘medical termination of pregnancy’ to reduce the opposition form various religious groups. The objective of this Act is to improve the mental health of Indian women keeping the therapeutic grounds valid andkeepinga check on the mortality rate of the women due to the prevalent illegal abortion of the unfavored sex.There are certain conditions under which a woman can terminate her pregnancy. These conditions have been specified under S.3 of the Act-As an extending hand to reduce the bureaucracy for obtaining the approval of facilities, the Act has decentralized the regulation of abortion facilities fromthe state level committees to district level committees that are empowered to approve and regulate the abortion facilities.However, there are still several hindrances with respect to the smooth functioning of this Act. The MTP (Amendment) Bill, 2020 has been successful in bringing about these changes. This bill was approved by the Union Cabinet and has raised the legally permissible limit for an abortion to 24 weeks which was earlier 20 weeks. During the period between 20-24 weeks, the opinion of minimum two doctors will be required to proceed with an abortion. Further, it has also allowed the failure of contraceptives as a valid reason of abortion for both married and unmarried women.The plight of women in this society is never ending. Relief is evident due to such legislations, where the reproductive rights of women are considered to be an essential right of humans recognized under several international conventions (The Universal Declaration of Human Rights 1948). The increase in the gestational period during a woman’s pregnancy under the new amended Bill ensures dignity, autonomy, confidentiality, and justice for womenwishing to terminate their pregnancy. This bill strengthens the reproductive rights of women and prevents young girls from falling prey to unsafe abortion practices.Medical abortion- when a woman is 7 weeks or less pregnant, she can undergo a medical abortion process. This process involves the administering of pills and medications to terminate the pregnancy. This is usually carried out under the prescription and supervision of a physician.Surgical Abortion- this method is practiced when a woman wishes to undergo an abortion after 7 weeks of her gestation period.312 defines abortion as ‘Whoever voluntarily causes a woman with child to miscarry shall, if miscarriage be not carried in good faith for the purposes of saving life of the woman, be punished with imprisonment’. The provisions mentioned above states that an abortion conducted with or without the consent of a woman is a punishable offence, except if it is done for the protection of the mother’s life, and in no other circumstances abortion would be allowed as a matter of right. Any person if in bad faith, voluntarily causes a woman to miscarriage shall face punishment of imprisonment for up to 3 years and a fine. Under the Indian laws, abortion is illegalwhen- a woman carries a child i.e. the gestation period has begun; and a woman is quick with child, which means the mother can feel the child’s motion.When the continuance of pregnancy is resulting in a risk to the life of a woman or of a grave injury, affecting both physical and mental health.When there is a substantial risk that if the child is born, it would suffer from physical and mental abnormalities (handicap).When the pregnancy is said to be the alleged outcome of rape.When the pregnancy occurs due to the failure of any device or method used by a married woman or her husband for the purpose of limiting their family planning.When the length of the pregnancy has not exceeded twelve weeks.When the length of the pregnancy has exceeded twelve weeks but has not exceeded twenty weeks."

    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma of JEMTEC, School of Law and curated by Rasveen Kaur Kapoor, Indore Institute of Law.“The idea of Humanity is no longer confined to man; it is beginning to extend itself to the lower animals, as in the past it has been gradually extended to savages and slaves” – Henry S. Salt.Bestiality, or human-animal intercourse, has been a concern amongst legal and mental health community since many years. Ancient legal codes delineated punishments for those who engage in the behaviour, denoting a general and moral societal concern surrounding bestiality dating to ancient times. Given this continued concern in human beings for having a sexual intercourse with animals and the legal attempts to prosecute them, no work for its betterment is substantially being done. It is important for clinicians to know the legal status of behaviour in their jurisdictions, to understand possible medical and psychiatric complications and comorbidities, and to know how to diagnose and address individuals who are engaged in bestiality or diagnosed with zoophilic disorder related to it.Zooerasty or zoorasty is almost the same as bestiality, with the additional fact that there is a possibly pathological component in the perpetrator, the zooerast, i.e. he may prefer an animal even though other natural sexual Intercourse options may be available to him generally. Depending on the human preferences as regards penetration or being penetrated, both male and female animals can be involved. The depictions of human-animal sexual interactions have a long tradition in mythology and art but typically reflect animal anthropomorphism rather than historical fact.Bestiality, too, carries risks to human health. Leptospirosis, echinococcosis, rabies etc. can be transmitted by animal sexual intercourse. Animals can carry genital, intestinal or urinary tract infections of human sexually transmitted diseases, bacterial or parasite infections and cancer-causing viruses. The first animal anti cruelty provision dates back to the United States in 1641-“The Body of Liberties,” introduced by the Massachusetts Bay Puritans. It was followed by U.K. animal law in 1781, the first to examine cattle treatment on the Smithfield market. Soon in 1786 UK passed legislation requiring a slaughter license.In India, the earliest national legislations were Wild Birds and Game Act, 1887; the Wild Birds and Wild Animals Protection Act, 1912; and the Indian Forest Act, 1927. India has made tremendous strides in the recognition of the various animal rights. Despite the existing measures, there are still instances of misdemeanours against them. The blurring of the human-subhuman boundaries is antithetical to human existence as a unique race.India’s constitution calls on every citizen of India to protect and improve the natural environment including lakes, forests, rivers and wildlife, and to have compassion for living creatures. Section 377 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 is a criminal statute covering various unnatural offences. It becomes difficult to know that an animal offense has been committed unless there is exclusive provision covering bestiality. In 2003, England introduced reform with respect to the bestiality offence-making specific legislation for it. Unfortunately, India does not have a body or agency that holds any data about animal sexual abuse. National Crime Records Bureau, Animal Welfare Board of India, Ministry of Environment, Forests and Climate Change (MoEFCC) etc. do not have any data related to animal cruelty incidents.Human beings have a moral responsibility to consider their responsibilities towards the animals. Since humans have the ability to think rationally; a consciousness, and a sense of right and wrong, they owe responsibility to others. To deal with the deteriorating civilization a moral and legal introspection must be made. Effective penal provisions must be brought in to deter the offenders. Animal welfare needs to be looked at in a respectful, non-patronizing and unapologetic way. Awakening sensitivity among human beings to animal dignity and rights, in a world where even human rights are often violated, is a little difficult. Bestiality has to become a topic open to public discourse. The laws alone would have brought no improvement. Social workers, veterinarians and the society as a whole need to participate.Keyword: Bestiality "

    "data": "This article has been written by Samta Sharma, Jemtec School of Law, Greater Noida and curated by Rasveen Kaur Kapoor, Indore Institute of Law.‘Abduction’, a word that creates fear in the minds of people and is nearly snatching the headlines of every newspapers recently. According to –Oxford Dictionary, ‘The abduction is the action of taking someone away by force, threat, or deceit against their will’, and is typically done to earn benefits from the family or victim who is abducted in order to set them free. It is a serious global issue. Abduction not only creates fear in the mind of a victim but can also harm a person physically, mentally and psychologically in entirety. There are many strict laws established in countries around the world to curb acts of abduction. The impacts of abduction may lead to depression and cause degeneration of brain cells to the victim.Section 362, of Indian Penal Code defines Abduction as, ‘Whoever by force compels, or by any deceitful means induces, any person to go from any place, is said to abduct that person.’ Though the definition of abduction is in provided in its literal sense, but the reasons and types are many. Abduction not only means to bring a person forcefully without his will but it can also be done by successfully persuading the victim and take him with his consent. In the case of Bahadur Ali vs King Emperor, the abductor misrepresented himself as a police constable and abducted a girl by ‘persuading’ her to stay in his house and demanded for a ransom of Rs.600. It was held that his act amounts to abduction.According to penal provisions of the Indian Penal Code,1860;Section 364, states the punishment for abduction in order to murder, i.e. 10+ years of imprisonment and fine.Section 365, states the punishment for abduction with intent to wrongfully confine a person, i.e.7 years and fine.Section 366, states the punishment for abduction for compelling a women to marry, i.e. 10 years and fine.Child abduction is the most committed crime globally as it is an easy task for any abductor to convince a child who is not so mature to make right decisions. According to the law, an abducted person can be anyone, of any age. It can be a child or an adult or an elderly person too. The grounds of abduction encapsulates from child abduction to abduction in pursuance of marriage. Statistically, ‘Child Abduction’ is the most committed abduction in the world. It is the action of removing a child from the safe custody of his/her parents usually by compelling, and sometimes by means of violence. It is usually done for the ransom or satisfy any form of enmity. Child abduction can either be done by a stranger or by their own parents. Though it is reckoned that abduction by strangers sustain more attention but it shall also be taken a note that, child abductions by family members itself including the child’s own parents or non-custodial parents is also prevalent. Child Abduction is however common in custodial battles amongst divorced parents and families therewith.Child abductions are more complex to deal with when they are done by a stranger. It is indeed a crime that can spoil the future of anyone and may even affect the moral, mental, physical and psychological well-being of a person. In addition; psychologists have found two distinguishing kinds of behavior in the child subjected to abduction. These are frozen fright and infantilism. Initially, a hostage suffering from frozen fright condition may have paralysis of common emotions. Later, the victim develops regressed behavior, such as too much dependence on the abductor.On the other hand, abduction in pursuance of marriage, refers to the act where a bride is abducted by the groom or anyone connected therewith to halt her due process of marriage that is being conducted presently or is subjected to be so conducted in the near future; against her will. The other kind of abduction includes ‘express abduction’, where to a ransom is being demanded expressly from the near and dear ones of the person so targeted of abduction.Although the terms, ‘Abduction’ and ‘Kidnapping’ are used equivalently but there rests a precise difference in both of them. Kidnapping is basically snatching someone away from their family’s custody forcefully. However, a crime of abduction is when a person has been taken along from his/her original location by persuading him. Kidnapping is committed against a minor (who is below the age of 16). On the other hand, in abduction there is no given age as such, anybody can be abducted.Abduction comes in all forms of different shapes and have its own crying degrees of cruelty. It is truly said that a person’s safety lies in his own hands. Cases like abduction can only be reduced when the root cause of it will be cleared. Though there are already different laws executed by the legislature for safety and prevention of such crimes but apart from the state’s prevention, the citizens should also make sure that no one is trying to convince them in a wrongful way. As reckoned generally; “Prevention is better than cure”. Specially in the matters concerning children, parents should be careful with their child’s safety & security. They should make sure that nobody is trying to attract their child through any smart, greedy techniques.Keyword:Abduction"

    "headline": "Is The 50% Domicile Reservation in National Law University Delhi Violative of Article 15 (3)?Unique case in history of India and Pakistan- Kulbhusan Jadhav’s caseNational Law Institute University-International Academy for Dispute Resolution, International Law School Mediation TournamentWEB INACCESSIBILITY FOR THE DISABLED DURING COVID-19: AN ANALYSIS",
    "data": "This article has been written by Kashish Goyal from Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.Firstly, the Article might be contravened by this policy. Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution states that nobody can prevent the State from making special provisions for women and children. Article 15(5) empowers the institution to make reservations on admissions to any private institution whether it is aided by the Government/State or not, except the minorities.In one of the cases named M.R. Balaji and Ors. Vs. The State of Mysore, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that such reservation should be reasonable and not exceed 50%. In another case of Indra Sawhney v. Union of India, which later became a landmark judgment; many essential points were stated:The petitioner had completed her graduation from the University of Rajasthan and had wanted to pursue her post-graduation, i.e., LL.M from Delhi. The petitioner stated that the reservation policy is not only a violation of Article 15 (3) but it also against reasonable grounds. The ones who have completed their education from Delhi itself will also be treated differently. This was really far away from intangible differentia.One of the recent writ petitions named Pia Singh vs. NLUD challenged that National Law University, Delhi which provides about 50% reservation in their prospectus to those who have qualified their examinations from Universities which are situated in Delhi for the following courses of L.L.M and L.L.B. The petition also challenged the 22% reservation for OBC and 10% reservation for EWS in the L.L.M. course without increasing the seats. According to the petition, it was contented by the petitioner that there has been a high increase in the number of reserved seats which adversely affect the unreserved category.Guidelines issued by the Authority:There is an Act called the Central Educational institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act 2006, which defines the criteria of reservation quota which should be provided to every one according to their classification.Section 5 of the above Act clearly states that any institution, whether private or public in nature, with the approval of appropriate authority, may increase their seats in any faculty or course on the permitted limit, but such number of seats should not be less than the number of seats which are actually filled for the academic session excluding the seats which are reserved for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. According to the following section, institutions are permitted to increase seats by 25% so that the unreserved category does not get affected. The basic motive behind is to ensure that the general category and unreserved category remain unaffected.The Ministry of Human Resource Development has also notified all the central institutions to follow the 103rd Amendment of the Constitution (which provides for the reservation of jobs in government institutions and also to the private institutions on the admission of students).According to the National Law University Act 2007, the objective of the Act is to create a national institution of excellence in the field of legal research. However, by providing a 50% reservation it would change the national character of NLU Delhi. Quantum of reservation was unreasonable and excessive.According to the data, in previous years, seats for the unreserved category amounted to 64 and in the current academic year, it is merely 30. Hence, it was crystal clear that NLUD had violated the guidelines issued by MHRD and had not adhered to the percentage for reservation which is permitted by them.It is admissible that any state can have reservations on the basis of domicile because it is residents who provide funds to the institution. But in this case, they are providing reservations on the basis of those who have qualified in Delhi based institutions only. It is unfair and unreasonable for those students who hail from other cities or even those who reside in Delhi itself, as the reservation applies to students merely having completed their education in Delhi too. In one of the cases of Sourabh Chowdhary & Ors. Vs. Union of India & Ors. , the Hon’ble Supreme Court affirmed that reservation should on the basis of domicile or institution through the fixed quota of reservation. In this case, the respondent could increase the limit by 50% but instead of this, the university cut down the seats of unreserved category which is totally beyond the authority.A statement may be concluded that “the classification which has been done between those who have passed from the Delhi institution or those who have passed from any other institution is irrelevant.” The reservation by the respondent university is too strange as it increases the fixed limit which is permitted by the court. If in case we add up all the reservation, it becomes 80%, which is unfair and inequitable for the unreserved category.Lastly, it can be concluded that every university should follow the guidelines which are issued for the reservation policy. If they want to increase the seats, they must take the approval of authority before the reservation. The reservation should be reasonable, and should not be discriminated against on the basis of any ground. While giving reservations, the university should have taken the preview of the previous years’ seats. If they want to do so, they can increase the seats with the proper procedure. The Examination Authority plays a vital role in giving admissions to the students. The criteria of reservation on the basis of institution qualifications are unfair and should be done away with.The government held that only a 27% reservation may be allotted for the Backward Classes.The Court also fixed a 50% reservation for others."

    "headline": "Female Genital Mutilation: A Curse to HumanityCan anticipatory bail once granted, be reviewed?Moot Court Preparation CourseISRAEL PALESTINE CONFLICT",
    "data": "This article has been written by Aaryaki Rana, Chanakya National Law University, Patna, and curated by Sahana Arya.Genital mutilation remains an act of inhumane consequence and prejudice against women in today’s society. This practice is a manifestation of gender inequality against girls and women, and discrimination that is submerged in the traditional economic, social and political structures. Female excision, that is female genital mutilation or female circumcision is considered to be a ritual wherein some or all the external female genitalia is removed. The World Health Organization (2008) defines FGM as all procedures involving partial or total removal of the external female genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for nonmedical reasons.This further causes injury to the female genital organs. This practice is most prevalent in Africa, Asia and the Middle East, where in such practices are centric to certain communities, for nom- medical reasons. This practice is deeply rooted in several communities and these traditions remain unclear. The most commonly practiced and preached reasons for genital mutilation states that it attempts to control the women’s sexuality and their experience of amorous pleasure resulting from sexual intercourse. These communities also believe that this practice is required for a girl’s humble and proper upbringing, to maintain the sanctity of marriage and to maintain the family’s honor. Female genital mutilation as is practiced in India, is called “khatna” or “khafz”, which involves the removal of the clitoral hood or clitoris. This practice is the most common among the Bohra community, who are found mostly in the states of Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh and Kerala. This practice, under the veil of secrecy is practiced on girls from the age 0-15 years. It is seen that these surgical removals are caused by traditional circumcisers, in unhygienic conditions with unsafe instruments.FGM may qualify as a form of “hurt or grievous hurt” under the Indian Penal Code and a crime under the Section 3 of POCSO Act, due to the process being carried out with an instrument of non-surgical nature, however there is no specific law in India in this respect. Article 25 and 26 of the Indian Constitution guarantees the right to freedom of religion and freedom to manage religious affairs, however such individual freedom is subject to the provisions of the Part III of the Indian Constitution i.e. fundamental rights which includes the fundamental right to equality and non-discrimination based on sex, guaranteed under Article 14 and 15 of the Indian Constitution. The practice of FGM falls under this purview as it targets women with the objective of limiting their sexual desires as they are merely seen as objects that need to be kept in check. It is also propagated in the name of the protection of women form other men, except for their husbands. Thus, this act violates the fundamental right to life guaranteed to such women under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. In the case of Sri Adi Visheshwara of Kashi Vishwanath Temple, Varanasi v. State of Uttar Pradesh the Supreme court, pronouncing on the management and administration of the Viswanath Temple that overrode custom, laws and decrees, contrarily held that : “The denomination sect is also bound by the constitutional goals and they too are required to abide by the law; they are not above law. Law aims at removal of the social ills and evils for social peace, order, stability and progress in an egalitarian society. … For instance, untouchability was believed to be a part of Hindu religious belief. But human rights denounce it and Article 17 of the Constitution of India abolished it and its practice in any form is a constitutional crime punishable under civil Rights Protection Act. Article 15(2) and other allied provisions achieve the purpose of Article 17.” The practice of FGM similarly, regardless of being a religious practice of the Bohra Community must be subject to constitutional morality and the Bohra community will have to bow to the constitutional norms equality and non- discrimination.Countries such as Sudan have created laws for banning the practice of genital mutilation in women. A number of countries have taken a similar step towards the same, by declaring the applicability of child protection laws or by enacting specific legislations, for the elimination of such harmful practices. The United Kingdom enacted the Female Genital Mutilation Act, 2003 which was amended by Section 73 of the Serious Crime Act, 2005 to include FGM Protection Orders. This order is essentially a civil measure which can be applied for through a family court. The breach of an FGM Protection Order is a criminal offence here which leads to a sentence of upto 5 years in prison.However, India has not been successful in deciding to acknowledge such a practice. This is mainly because it goes unreported in our country. The Integrated Child Protection Scheme (ICPS) is targeted towards providing preventive and rehabilitative services to children. These children are those who are “in need of care and protection and children in conflict” as defined under Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act, 2015. Girls who are subject to the FGM practice are beneficiaries of the ICPS, and thus ICPS also envisages the preparation of an individual care plan by professional assessment, so that it could incorporate the specialised services under the scheme for the girl. Despite such an initiative, India has to set on a long journey for the protection of the females, which have always been a rigorous object of discrimination since time immemorial. Recent events and judgments have shown the Supreme Court bowing down to religion over law, which has only been equipped with the reason of tradition, should not be acceptable and must be seen and held in it’s true nature of being in violation of Human Rights in the eyes of international law.Keyword: Excision"

    "headline": "Is Right to Reservation not considered as Fundament Right?Drastic Changes in Advocates Act 1961GULMEHAR KAUR-ABVP ROW: A CONSTITUTIONAL GRADIENTWill you be sued for creating up a fake Facebook account?",
    "data": "This Article is written by RIYA KAUSHIK studying LL.B. in GEETA INSTITUTE OF LAW and Curated by Sahana Arya.Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution of India are those rights which are essential for the Socio-economic, moral-spiritual and intellectual growth of the citizens of India. These are the basic rights which are essential in nature and are obligatory so as to realize the Right of Life and Liberty in Article 21 of the Constitution of India. Because Right to Life doesn’t mean merely an animal life, but Right to Life with Human dignity. The fundamental right is enshrined for this purpose in the Constitution of India.There are several other rights provided under the Constitution of India; but these rights are not obligatory in nature. The fundamental rights provided under the constitution of India are obligatory in nature and if any of the fundamental right of a person is violated, then he can approach to Supreme Court to enforce that Right.But the Rights which are not fundamental in their nature and are not obligatory can’t be enforced by Supreme Court. They are Constitutional Rights and are enabling in nature, one can approach to High Court if any other right which is not fundamental in nature to plead.Now talking about Right to Reservation; To realise the promise of equality enshrined in the Constitution of India, Reservation is introduced in it. Right to Reservation is enshrined in Article 15 and 16 of the Indian Constitution. Reservation is given to the “socially and educationally backward classes of citizens”Article 15(4) says that there should be no discrimination on the grounds of Religion, Race, caste etc.; while the Article 16(4) empowers the state to make special provisions for the Backward classes in Public Employment. These are enabling provisions based on discretion of government and are not obligatory.Now, a question arises that if the Right to Reservation is violated that can one approach to Supreme Court to Enforce it? In other words, Is Right to Reservation a Fundamental Right?Right to reservation is not a Fundamental Right as observed by the Supreme Court in the Case of Tamil Nadu where parties withdraw plea for quota. The parties allege that the Central Government is violating the Right of fair education of the People of Tamil Nadu by not implementing the 50% quota for Backward classes and Most Backward classes.Does it mean that Reservation is not a Fundamental right?Reservation is indeed not a Fundamental right; In the precedents also, it is mentioned that the Right to Reservation provided under Article 15(4) and 16(4) of the Constitution do not impose an obligation and it is applicable on the discretionary power of the government. In case of R. Balaji vs State of Mysore, the apex court held the same that the Right to Reservation is not and obligation and subject to discretionary power of the appropriate Government.In many more cases like A. Rajendran vs Union of India, Indira Sawhney vs Union of India & in M Nagraj vs Union of India, the apex court reiterated the decision held in R. Balaji vs State of Mysore Case.The latest judgement of the Apex Court makes it clear that the Actions allowed in Constitution flow from “enabling provisions” and are not Rights as such. Article 16(4) is also enabling in nature. In other words, the state is not bound to provide reservation.In the Article itself, it is mentioned that it is at the discretion of government to make provisions regarding reservation and they may make provisions for the same if they found it justified.Now, another question arises why Right to Reservation is not a Fundamental Right?The Reservations provided in the Indian Constitution are for the equality of opportunities to all citizens without any discrimination. The time when the Reservation were introduced in the Constitution of India, was a time when the lower class were treated crudely by the upper-class people and to bring equality in the status of both “Reservations” were introduced.But now the scenario has changed; a lot of amendments have been made in the Constitution of India. There are many more provisions introduced for bringing equality in status quo. The concept of reservation which is enshrined in the Constitution was for this purpose only. But it is at the discretion of the appropriate government as to how apply them.Thus, Reservation can’t be admitted as Fundamental Right, as the Article 14 itself lays down the Right to equality which means right to equality in all opportunities, which implies no one can reserve a better position for oneself only on the basis of reservation, the opportunity should be equal to all.The matter which arose in front of Apex Court was related to reservation in promotions which is given under Article 16(4) which says the discretion of government to make reservation in public employment and their promotions. It is not an obligation on government to provide reservation to all. The article 16(1) also lays down the same that there shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment in any office under state. Thus, one can’t approach to Supreme court to enforce this right.The Supreme Court in its judgement also in the case of Tamil Nadu allow to withdraw the appeal to enforce the Right to Reservation in promotions otherwise they will dismiss it. In the opinion of the Apex Court, no Fundamental Right is violated thus no writ can be made in front of Supreme Court. However, one can approach to High Court to appeal for the enforcement of his Constitutional Right. "

    "headline": "Rights of Transgender : A long way to goISRAEL PALESTINE CONFLICTEMPLOYER’S LIABILITY DURING THE PERIOD OF NATIONWIDE LOCKDOWNREFORMING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS IN INDIA: PRINCIPLE-BASED SOLUTIONS",
    "data": "This article has been written by Riya Kaushik from Geeta Institute of Law and has been curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.Androgyny is the combination of the Masculine and Feminine characteristics into an ambiguous form. It can be regarded as the biological sexual identity of a person. Androgyny in the context of the Mixed Biological Sex characteristics in a person is referred to as Intersex People. Androgyny can be achieved even by personal grooming and a certain amount of THT treatment.An individual can be regarded as an Androgyne if he feels to possess the characteristics of both men and women. A person who is Androgyne is free to engage in the tasks assigned to a Masculine or a Feminine character person. They have a balanced identity and are also regarded as a Gender Neutral Person.Recently, the Supreme Court of United States has also passed a judgement related to the Rights of Transgenders. The US Supreme Court held that the employers cannot fire the employee on the basis of their gender identity or sexual orientation. The transgenders are protected from discrimination.In actuality, the matter arose in the case of Mr. Tudor, who is a Professor at the South-Eastern Oklahoma State University. Mr. Tudor, after transitioning from male to female, applied for his tenure of job. However, she was fired by the administration for her new gender identity which banned transgenders from service.The Supreme Court of US arrived to a decision after a period of nine years in this case. The court held that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act extended to Gender Identity. It prohibits the discrimination of employees on the basis of Race, Color, Sex and Nationality. The Act protects the Rights of Transgenders and Gay people. The Ruling involved three cases filed by the employees who claimed to have been fired from their jobs because of their Gender Identity. The President of Human Rights Campaign, Alphonso David quoted it as the “Landmark Victory of LGBTQ.”The situation of the LGBTQ+ community in India is not very progressive either. They face many legal and social difficulties and are discriminated by the non-LGBTQ+ people. The provisions which discriminate Gay Sex and Transgender Identification have been removed by the Government; however, no legal protection is provided for Anti- Discrimination Laws and Same-Sex Marriage.The Transgenders have a Constitutional Right to change their gender. Now, the Third Gender is also recognized and prohibition is made on the discrimination based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity by state or government bodies. The adoption by single LGBTQ+ people is allowed but not by the same sex couple.The Transgenders are allowed to change their gender by post-sex reassignment surgery and a legislation related to this has also been passed in 2019. They also have a Constitutional Right to register themselves as Third Gender. There are approximately 4.8 million Transgender People in India. In 2018, The Hon’ble Supreme Court of India has decriminalized Homosexuality and declared the Section 377 of Indian Penal Code unconstitutional. Section 377 was related to the consensual homosexual sex between adults.A bill was introduced to ensure the overall development and welfare of the Transgender People. The Rights of Transgender Persons Bill, 2014 is a purposed Act of Parliament of India to end the discrimination faced by Transgenders in India. The Bill was passed by the Rajya Sabha on Apr. 24, 2015 and was introduced in the Lok Sabha on Feb. 26, 2016. The Bill was sent to the standing committee which submitted its report in July 2017. A newer version of the Bill was introduced in 2018 and was passed by the both the Houses in 2019 and after the assent of the President, it was notified in the Gazette of India. It came into effect from Jan. 10, 2020 and is known as The Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.However, the Act fails to incorporate the principles which were laid down in the NALSA case such as Right of Transgender Persons to Self-Perceived Gender Identity without undergoing Sex Reassignment surgery and the mandatory reservation in jobs and educational institutions.A National Council for Transgender Persons should be established to govern the implications of the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019. It will monitor the welfare measures taken for the Transgender Protection and Development and will evaluate the impact of these policies and programs. It will ensure the participation of Transgenders in the programs designed for their development and will also ensure the redressal of the grievances of such people among others.The Supreme Judiciary of US passed a historic judgement and affirmed that no one should be denied or fired from a job on the basis of gender discrimination. There are however, still some aspects where the LGBTQ+ faces discrimination. The Government should enact an Equality Act to improve the situation of the community.Improving the status of the Transgender community has to be a collective effort of all. The inclusion of the Transgender Community in the workplace will be a great initiative as it will remove the social stigma attached to their identification. It will also improve their economic position. The workforces in the organizations should also be educated about gender neutrality and inclusion of transgender people in the corporate environment. Employees should be given access to the washroom which is appropriate to their identity because in many circumstances, the transgender women are humiliated and are forced to use the male washroom. Organizations should revise their recruitment criteria keeping in mind the transgender people.Albeit many laws for transgender people exist, their situation has not changed much in the society. They are still humiliated by the society and in many cases, they are even boycotted by their own family and friends. In addition to making laws, education should be provided to all with respect to the third gender and their recognition as the non-LGBTQ+ people. The scenario can be changed only if such actions are taken.Keyword: Androgyne "

    "data": "This article is written by Anushka Sharma from Delhi Metropolitan Education, GGSIPU and curated by Sahana Arya.Tabligi Jamaat conference took place among 1,000 foreign nationals visiting it from various countries who visited India on a tourist visa. The conference took place in the Markaz Mosque, Nizamuddin, Delhi in early March. After this meeting, they visited various parts of the country to preach the religious values of Islam which eventually lead to surge in the number of cases.After this surge, the people involved in this were booked under foreigners act for violating their visa conditions and criminal proceedings against them were booked.The question which arises here is, whether these people have the right to return back to their native land after contributing to sufferance?Recently, in a notable judgement, the High Court of Madras directed withdrawing criminal proceedings against these 31 foreigners who were booked under the Foreigners Act for contributing to the violation.They also stated that the people found in the conference have the right to return back to their home/ native country as their continued imprisonment under such an uncertain situation will lead to violation of their right to life granted under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution as they have already suffered a lot because of the violation and they have the right to return back to their country as earliest as possible because of the existence of medical emergency around the globe.It has been stated by the Madras High Court, that during the time of emergencies like arm conflict or medical emergency, the right to leave the country can be accepted.The petitioners were not tested positive and as we are very uncertain of the future so we don’t know what’s next and this may push their lives into danger. As the petitioners are also ready to bear the cost of the transportation and they will be coordinating with their consultancies arranging for their return journey and even after doing this if they respondent want to detain them then it’ll be considered as unjust, unfair, and unreasonable and will eventually lead to violation of Article 21 of the Constitution of India.The people involved in the religious ceremony received a heavy criticism, they were locked up or imprisoned for a period of seventy days and the period for which they were imprisoned is sufficient in consideration of the crime they committed.The Hight Court of Madras also referred to Article 12(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) of which India is a signatory. It says that “No one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country.”The petitioners were arrested in the first week of April, 2020 and there has been no progress in the investigation. The imprisonment of the petitioners will not benefit anyone.The Madras High Court also stated in their judgement that the petitioners should not be detained in camps once they are granted bail and should be allowed to reside at a place which is set apart for the residence under supervision as mentioned in Section4(2) of the Foreigners Act.It is necessary that people don’t categorise them as “Tablighis” as categorisation can have difficulties and also makes the situation worse. These people hail from different countries and consist of women and senior citizens as well. They are also ready to file individual affidavits admitting their mistake of violating the visa conditions. Also, they took an undertaking of not returning back to India for the next 10 years.The author believes that they should be given a chance and detaining them or keeping them prisoned during such an adverse situation will deteriorate the situation and even the condition of the petitioners. It is important that they return back to their respective countries safely, take all necessary precautions and avoid repeating such mistakes in future."

    "headline": "Mens rea : A demon of senseEnvironmental Law Bare ActsCENTRE ISSUES GUIDELINES FOR DELIVERY OF ESSENTIAL GOODS THROUGH E-COMMERCESC: CLEARS THE RELEASE OF MADHUR BHANDARKAR’S FILM INDU SARKAR",
    "data": "This article is written by Anushka Sharma from Delhi Metropolitan Education, GGSIPU, and curated by NAMAN JAIN from Bennett University, Greater Noida. The two fundamental principles or components of the Criminal Law consists of both a mental and a physical element. These elements are Mens Rea and Actus Rea. Mens Rea is the mental element, whereas Actus Rea (the act itself) is a physical element.The well-known Latin maxim “Actus non facit reum nisi means sit rea” clearly describes the relationship between guilty mind and crime in general. The maxim means that the act does not itself makes a person guilty unless the mind of the person is also guilty.Guilty mind, also known as Mens Rea is the mental element, which is required for an act to constitute a crime. In simple words, the requirement is that the person doing wrong, also known as accused should be aware that he is doing something wrong. The intention of doing a wrongful act should be present to convict a person of a crime.The origin of this element can be traced back to the latter part of the common-law era. The concept was developed in England when the judges started considering that an act alone could not impose criminal liability unless and until it is accompanied by the mental element, i.e. the guilty state of mind.The concept of Mens Rea allows our justice system to differentiate between the one who never intended to commit a crime and the other who committed crime intentionally. Let us take an example: There are two people named A and B, both are drivers. A was driving a truck and did not see the person C standing on the road until it was too late to apply the brakes, but was not able to avoid or prevent the accident and ended up killing C. On the other hand, the person B was driving his truck and was looking for the person named D, so that, he could kill him. Further, on seeing him, he increased the speed of the truck and ended up killing the person D. In the two scenarios mentioned above, the person B can be considered criminally liable as he intended to kill the person named D. On the other hand, A is liable for the act, but will be sued only in the Civil Courts for monetary damages. In simple words, the outcomes of both the acts are same, but the intentions of both A and B are different, and therefore, the punishment of both A and B will also vary.Exception: There are certain criminal laws which do not require Mens Rea to constitute a crime. The act itself is considered sufficient in this case to constitute a crime. These are strict liability acts for which the law awards criminal punishment regardless of the intent of the person. These usually include the cases which involve minors, for example, The statutory rape laws. The act of having sex with a minor irrespective of the wrong belief of the offender that the person involved was above the age of 18 years, is also punishable.Essentials of Mens ReaConclusionMens Rea is the most crucial element of a crime. The prosecution typically must prove beyond the reasonable doubt that the defendant has committed a offence having a criminal intention.There are certain exceptions as mentioned above in the article, but apart from that in all the other cases, Mens Rea is an essential element to impose criminal liability.Mens Rea is a term which is not defined in the Indian Penal Code but is still, an essential element when we talk about criminal law. It can take various forms such as intention (aim or purpose of the defendant), recklessness (the unreasonable taking of a risk by the defendant), negligence (the defendant’s failure to act according to the standards of a reasonable person), and strict liability (crimes which do not require a Mens Rea).Keyword: Guilty Mind The construction of Mens Rea is from a person’s thought process, their motive, and intention.The two words, i.e. motive, and intention, are entirely different ideas. Motive is a reason behind the commission of an act, whereas intention is considered to be a person’s state of mind, and willingness to break the law.The presence of both these elements enables the prosecution of a crime, but the motive to commit an act is not considered as an essential element for a conviction."

    "headline": "Can anticipatory bail once granted, be reviewed?Nationwide Lawyers Strike on March 31: Judicial works get paralyzed for 24 hoursAn overview on Ranjit Thakur v Union of IndiaFraud in Corporate World- Know More",
    "data": "This article is written by Mansi Deore from the University of Mumbai Law Academy and curated by Shruti Chaudhary from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.Indian Criminal Law consists of a provision for Anticipatory Bail, prescribed under Section 438 of the Criminal Procedure Code (“CrPC”). Section 438 (1) lays down that ‘When any person has reason to believe that he may be arrested on an accusation of committing a non-bailable offence, he may apply to the High Court or the Court of Session for a direction under this section; and that Court may, if it deems fit, direct that in the situation of such arrest, he shall be released on bail.’ This section contains a new provision which gives the power to the superior courts to direct the release of person on bail prior to his arrest. This is commonly known as anticipatory bail.There was no express provision for anticipatory bail in the old CrPC. The law commission subsequently recommended for the introduction of the provision of anticipatory bail in the present Code. This bail may be applied in the anticipation of arrest. If you believe that you have an apprehension for getting arrested of the crime which you did not commit, then you have a right to apply for this bail.There are several conditions to be fulfilled for the application of anticipatory bail under the CrPC S.438 (1):(1) a condition that the person claiming bail must be available for interrogation by a police officer as and when required;(2) a condition that the person must not go out of India without the prior permission of the Court;(3) any other condition as may be enforced under Section 437 (3), as if the bail were granted under that section.The Criminal Procedure Code, 1973 guarantees protection to persons anticipating or fearing arrest. The fundamental distinction between regular bail and anticipatory bail is that while a regular bail is applied for, by a person only after his arrest, anticipatory bail is applied for, by a person in anticipation of his arrest and to assure order from the court to avert the definite arrest. This is in furtherance of the idea that no one deserves to face any shame or disgrace in case he is implicated in false cases. But, there are some conditions that need to be considered for grant of Anticipatory Bail. Also, if the Applicant is a renowned businessman, having prosperous standing in the society, then his application for Anticipatory Bail may not be refused solely because he has been accused of having committed an economic offence of any character. Furthermore, in case of any violation under Foreign Exchange and Regulation Act, 1973 (“FERA”), if a person is able to establish that he is being needlessly harassed by the investigating company, then the Court may grant Anticipatory Bail in his favor.While looking at the application for granting anticipatory bail, the court may after considering the factors listed below, either reject the application immediately or issue an interim order for the grant of anticipatory bail.The factors to be taken into deliberation while granting or rejecting an application for such bail are:Can anticipatory bail granted to a person be subjected to a review by the Court?This was a question brought up before the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India after it furnished a notice in a challenge to the order of Gauhati High Court by which grant of anticipatory bail to the petitioner was called into dispute. (Ainul Hoque Molla v. the State of Assam). In this case, the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail by a Bench of the Gauhati High Court in August 2019, and her petition was done away with in November 2019.Consequently, however, when the petitioner’s co-accused approached the High Court, a different Bench issued a notice to the petitioner as regards bail already granted to her. This Bench, governed by the Chief Justice propounded that the anticipatory bail was “erroneously grantednot and further, denying bail to the co-accused. This prompted the petitioner to move to the Supreme Court. The question posed before the Apex Court was whether the court has the power to review an order for bail that has already been granted, that too by a different judge.The Hon’ble Supreme Court specifically elaborated on the difference between an ordinary order of bail and an order of anticipatory bail. It declared that whereas the former is granted after the arrest, and therefore, means release from police custody, the latter is granted in anticipation of arrest, and is therefore effective at the very moment of arrest. The obligation for granting of anticipatory bail surface chiefly because sometimes the known and influential people make an attempt to implicate their revivals in fallacious cases, to disgrace them or for other concocted purposes by getting them detained in jail for some days.The anticipatory bail is the bail in which the accused does not stay a single day in the police custody (lockup in the police station) or in the judicial custody (jail) until his case gets decided, if he gets the order in his favour and it may be argued that the best legal relief for accused person is the anticipatory bail among all types of bails. This applies to the all criminal cases including dowry cases. The nature and gravity of the accusation;The previous record of the applicant, including whether he has, in the past, been imprisoned for having committed any cognizable offence,The possibility of the applicant fleeing from justice; andWhether the accusation has been made with the object of injuring or humiliating the applicant by having his arrested."

    "headline": "MINOR WRONGDOINGS: INTRODUCTION AND ITS PROVISIONSKulbhushan Case: Will ICJ rule in favour of India? Live Update#LIFE IMPRISONMENT-AN ALTERNATIVE TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENTTAX PAYERS",
    "data": "This article is written by Kashish Goyal from Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan, and curated by Naman Jain of Bennett University, Greater Noida. Minor wrongdoings are a less serious crime; and if any person commits, he/she will be awarded imprisonment for a term of less than one year, or with penalty, or both. Sometimes, people get confused between the terms “Infraction” and “Misdemeanour”. Infraction is a less serious crime that constitutes non-following of any rule or ordinance by a person, whereas Misdemeanour is more serious than Infractions.There are many provisions under IPC which comes under Misdemeanour:Under Criminal trespass, the main element is the commission of an offense. For Example, an act of a person entering a movie hall without a ticket is not covered under the category of criminal trespass.The main ingredients of criminal trespass:In many landmark judgements, the court has stated the essential ingredients required for an act to constitute a criminal trespass. In the case of State of Calcutta vs. Abdul Sukar, the court held that “There must be a personal entry by an accused instead of a Constructive entry upon the property”.In another case of Trilochan Singh V. The Director, Small Industries, a boy sends a love letter to a girl and delivered the letter at her residence. The innocent girl got annoyed as he entered her house to deliver this letter. This act was held guilty of criminal trespass by the Madras High Court.Provisions for Punishments regarding Trespass:To constitute an offense of assault, there must be a threatening or a physical act by making a gesture that will cause the other person to believe, that the person is about to use criminal force. This is also known as apprehension. The person who pretends or apprehends must have the intention/knowledge that the act will cause the other person to doubt. Moreover, mere words cannot amount to an assault. There should be something more than the mere words resulting in a grave and sudden provocation by the complainant.Anyone held guilty of assault will be awarded imprisonment up to three months, or a fine of five hundred rupees, or both.It states that any person who drives recklessly on the road without following the traffic rules and not pays due care and attention, resulting in an injury or hurt to another person, shall be guilty of rash driving. The offender shall be punished with imprisonment that may extend up to six months, with Rs five hundred fine as mentioned under S. 279 of the IPC.In the case of Mohammad Saffique V. the State of Orissa, rash driving has been defined clearly. It was pointed out in the case that place and time are the two factors, which decides the speed, rashness, and the severity of negligence caused by the vehicle or the offender. For example, on a straight-wide road, where pedestrians or any other obstructions are not present, we cannot say that driving speedily or absence of horn by the driver would amount to rash driving or negligence. A motor vehicle is intended to be driven with speed.Further, S. 280 of the IPC deals with Rash navigation of a vessel, which states that rash and negligent navigation in seas and all waterways, or any other private or public waterways excluding high seas, is an offence of rash navigation of the vessel. Whoever commits this offence will be punished with imprisonment of a term which may extend up to six months, or with one thousand rupees fine, or both.Decency and morality simply mean that behaviour of a person should be acceptable to the public and should not be obscene. Whoever does any obscene act in public with an intention to annoy others, or sings/recites any obscene song in the public place shall be punished with imprisonment of three months, or with fine, or both as mentioned under S. 294 of the IPC.Misconduct in public by a drunken person is known as Public Intoxication. Any person who appears at a public place under intoxication and commits an act, creating annoyance at a public place would be liable for public intoxication. Mens Rea is not required for the commencement of the offence. Only the state of intoxication in public places is enough. The offender will be punished with a term of maximum twenty-four hours, or with fine which may extend to ten rupees, or with both.CONCLUSIONIt is concluded that all the wrongs defined above are covered in the category of minor wrongdoings. All the above offences impose a penalty less than one year with fine. These are the crimes in which the offender is not liable for any rigorous imprisonment as they are of less heinous nature.Keyword: Misdemeanour CRIMINAL TRESSPASS441 of the IPC defines “Criminal trespass” which states that if any person enters into your property with the intent to commit an offense or in case enters upon the property with lawful means, but remains on the property with an intention to annoy or insult, that person will be liable for committing a criminal trespass. For instance, if a delivery boy requests a customer to let him enterthe living room for the purpose of delivery, but without permission, he enters into the bedroom for the purpose of annoying the customer while having a criminal intention, he would be liable for criminal trespass.Unauthorized entryThe property should be in the possession of the ownerIntention to commit an offense442 of the IPC defines “house-trespass”-Whoever commits criminal trespass by entering into any building, tent, or any place of worship is said to commit house-trespass.443 of the IPC defines “Lurking House trespass”, under which the offender takes some effective measures/steps to conceal the presence of a person who has the right to exclude the trespasser from the building.445 of the IPC defines “House Breaking”- a person is held liable for this offence if he enters or quits the house by any of the methods mentioned below:If he enters by himself or by the abettor.If he enters or quit by opening a lock.If he enters or quit for committing an offense by criminal force.Punishment for Criminal trespass: term of the imprisonment may be extended to three months with fine which may extend up to five hundred rupees or both as stated under S. 447 of the IPC.ASSAULTRASH DRIVINGINDECENT EXPOSURE PUBLIC INTOXICATION"

    "data": "This article is written by Bhavya Verma from JEMTEC, School of Law, Greater Noida and curated by Shruti Chaudhary from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.India’s mental healthcare is already marred by a lack of access to basic information and a reluctance to accept mental health as a real issue. The tolerance that can be extended to a person dealing with mental-health problems, or frustrated by the profession’s demands, is uncommon. Those circumstances shut down the chance of an attorney receiving advice from his or her colleagues, placing them in a catch-22 position and sometimes forcing them to choose to entrust the practice to strangers to address even work-related issues.All aspiring lawyers and law students are told that their precious possessions are their mental faculties. Those in the profession still sing praises of the “great legal minds” that every young lawyer sooner or later aspires to imitate. Law practice, an adversarial environment that frequently thrives on hostile debate, and a culture of one-upmanship, is being sold as the profession’s “thrill” to young lawyers. Being creative, motivated and sharp are some of the qualities that the profession lauds and rewards. As a lawyer, your work for your client can be a matter of life and death. It often involves material or other objects which are valuable to them. Certainly, such stress is present in several other professions, medicine, for example, or law enforcement. As a lawyer, the requirement to also be a mouth-piece for the client in court can compound such stresses. A counsel is expected to engage in a daily battle of wits with other lawyers as well as judges on their client’s behalf. The same applies to the corporate side of the profession, where customer service is assigned great importance. While parallels can be drawn with other professions, there is no objection to the fact that a daunting and stressful exercise is the performance of engaging in a verbal and intellectual duel with the opponent counsel and the judges on behalf of the client.Although few such studies have been conducted in India, it would not be amiss to assume that similar pressures and perils exist in the Indian profession despite a different working culture. The legal profession has consistently seen high incidences of mental health problems like depression. Inherently, the legal profession prescribes various characteristics that a lawyer must display to be rewarded for their work, but these characteristics are also those that force our community to brush under the carpet of mental health issues.What happens to an attorney who faces a difficult time at work, who might not be able to work under such strain? The urge to over-extend yourself is so ingrained that it will probably be difficult for such a lawyer to speak to others at work about the trouble he/she is facing, for fear of being considered a slacker. The fear and anxiety of making it in their occupations is omnipresent for young professionals. These concerns, for young lawyers, are whether they will succeed as independent legal counsel, whether they will be able to generate work, whether their training is sufficient, whether they are constantly working with the right people are always there.International perspectiveALM’s survey, conducted for the first time in 2019, questioned participants about their own mental health in general and their work in the law firm, as well as mental health observations in their firms and the legal industry as a whole. ALM’s Mental Health and Substance Abuse Survey found that 64% of the respondents feel that they have anxiety, more than 31.2% feel that they are depressed, 10.1% feel that they have an alcohol problem and 2.8% feel that they have a drug problem. 73% of them replied yes when asked “whether their work environment contribute to their mental health issues or not”. When they were asked whether the profession has a negative effect on their mental health over time or not, 74% replied affirmatively.In 1990, a study of major depressive disorders in various occupations in the United States of America, conducted by Johns Hopkins University, found that the attorneys displayed the highest number of working professionals with depression.The American Bar Association has a dedicated page on its website focusing on lawyers’ mental health and providing ‘lawyer assistance programs’ which provide confidential resources and support to judges, lawyers and law students facing mental health issues.It was noted by Doraisamy that one in every three lawyers or law students in Australia battled depression.Solution While growing one’s awareness and improving other skills are important to achieve success, today it is not the need of the hour. It is disappointing that there is no effort, even during a pandemic, to open a dialog on mental health so that associates can understand and deal with the anxiety that these uncertain times have brought upon us. Energy is still being focused on being ‘successful,’ instead of being productive. Young lawyers who are living away from their families have become even more overwhelmed by the lockdown, because of which they are unable to cope with the dual tasks of surviving as well as doing work from home in these desperate times.We need to put an end to the stigma. We need to start learning about the prevalence of mental illness in our profession. In our practice, we attach considerable importance to the idea of “seniority,” although it is acknowledged only by law in relation to the appointment of senior counsel by various high courts and the Supreme Court. These issues need to be identified, acknowledged and addressed by senior lawyers acting as mentors.The good news is that there are healthy coping mechanisms available, and it has been proven that they help lawyers to reduce anxiety and depression. Meditation is the main among them. The law schools at Yale, Berkeley University of California, and San Francisco University have started offering courses in mindfulness. In addition to meditation, eating both healthfully and mindfully should not be underrated as a method of combating anxiety.Bar councils and associations should also play a significant role in facilitating discussion among lawyers to make it easier for them to speak about these issues or reach out to others as these organizations regularly claim that they exist for lawyers’ welfare and mental well-being."

    "headline": "Legality of Prostitution in India: Right to work or violation of women.CALL FOR AMENDMENT TO PHR ACTPROTECTION OF CARTOON CHARACTERS IN INDIACHALLENGE ON THE SELECTION OF BJP VICE PRESIDENT AS NHRC MEMBER: SC ISSUES NOTICE",
    "data": "This article has been written by Barkha, from JEMTEC School of Law.Introduction Prostitution is the promotion of sexual act in the exchange of money. It is commercialization of sex i.e. asking for money in the exchange of sex.This trade of vicecrime is prevailing in nearly each part of the planet. It is being practiced from ancient period. This trade has degraded the status of women inthesociety. In several places, girls are simply used as associate object to satisfy sexual desires of men.In numerouscountries, women are forced into this trade and are being exploited. In some countries it is legal whereas in some countries it is still considered to be a taboo. In India, it is a general misconception that prostitution is illegal but it is actually legal but some acts related to prostitution are declared to be illegal. Although prostitution is legal in India but it is considered to be immoral. Prostitution in India is resulting in human and child trafficking and exploitation against women. Women from poor and backward families are facing violence.Hence, involvement of women in this trade is abasing them.History“Prostitution is one of the oldest professions of the world practiced since the birth of the organized society.” [1]It is practiced in almost every part of the world. In India, it is prevalent from very ancient times. Even in the time of kings, women called as ‘dasees/ tawaifs’ used to be involved in this trade.Women from the very starting are used to satisfy sexual needs of men. Even in historical texts like ‘Manusmriti’it is mentioned that, women’s existence in the society is just to fulfill the sexual needs of men.“It is the nature of women to seduce men in this world; for that reason, the wise are never unguarded in the company of females.”[2]It is clear from the above statement how this patriarchal societyhad perception about women and it is still being continued. They considered the sole purpose of existence of women in thisworld is to satisfy men sexually. From the establishment of society men are taught to be strong whereas women are taught to focus on beauty and to seduce man and be submissive. Even in purans there are many instances that justify the saying that it is one of the oldest professions.” Puranas have laid down that women who shared her couch with two men was called Kulata, with three was a Darshini, with four was Pungaschalea and with five was called veshya. The women who gave herself to people more than five in number was known as mahaveshya.”[3] Even in the old sculptures women have been objectified and the sexual act of man and woman are shown. In many paintings it is depicted that women used to dance in front of the king and hisministers to entertain and seduce them. Even it is given in Rig Veda that there was a tradition that kings give the present of slave women to rishi/munis.[4]In the period of devas, the chief deva ‘Indra’ is depicted enjoying the company of women with alcohol in one hand. It was prevalent in mughal period as well.Dasis who were sex workers in the kings’ palace, held the highest post among all prostitutes, and had highest fees. Even kings used to maintain and keep prostitutes in their houses. “Thus, she was reduced from human person to just bodies, for male utility.”[5] This evil has been prevalent around the globe, from the beginning and is still practiced.Strategy Followed Around the Globe There are three systems used across the globe to deal with sex work i.e. suppression, regulation and abolition.[6]Firstly, Suppression(criminalization), it means to prohibit it completely i.e.declaring prostitution to be a crime.Any act related to prostitution will be considered as crime, and any individual practicing it could be booked for the same. Any party such as pimps, brokers, traffickers, managers, including the prostitutes and the clients would be arrested and punished. Secondly, Regularisation(Legalisation), it means to declare prostitution to be legal and can be practiced without any fear. Legalisation will help in the protection of prostitutes. It includes direct intervention of government in acts like, registration and maintenance of brothels, and medical check up of prostitutes as well. Legalisation will enable to government to successfully stop exploitation against these sex- workers, but for the achievement of such goal there is requirement of effective policies and proper implementation of laws. Failure of government in maintaining brothels and providing aid to sex workers will worsen the situation. Hence, proper implementation is crucial. Thirdly, Abolition (Toleration), it refers to a system where all the laws framed against prostitution are abolished. “The abolitionist approach calls for the elimination of laws against prostitution itself.”[7] In this system neither the sex worker nor the client is punished for service in private but soliciting in public places, keeping brothel etc. is a crime.India’s PolicyAs discussed above, it is a general misconception that prostitution in India is illegal, rather prostitution is legal but pimping, owning and managing a brothel is illegal.[8] Laws related to prostitution are given in immoral trafficking(prevention) act, 1956.India is the house of Asia’s largest red-light district which indicates that implementation of laws is not strong in India.ConclusionAs discussed above, practice of prostitution is prevalent in almost every part of the world. As this exists in almost every country, different countries have different ways to deal with it. Many countries have legalized it. Prostitutes and other party related to it can not be punished, and everything will be handled by the government. But here the question arises does legalization of prostitution in various countries pave a way for it to get legalized in India.In my point of view, legalization of prostitution in various countries can not pave way for the legalization of the same in India. As already discussed above, in order to make prostitution legal, there will be requirement of providing all the brothel and other related services in the hands of the government. And for the proper operation of the same there shall be proper implementation of laws. A country like India, lacks effective implementation of laws and the law maintenance system is so weak hence, can lead to the worsening of the situation.Legalization of prostitution in India will result into more crimes. Child trafficking, women trafficking will also increase more. making acts related to prostitution legal with improper law implementation will make the offenders fearless. Exploitation of women will rise.The tendency of poor families to sell their wife, daughters and sisters will increase. It will come out to be an easy way for families to earn money using the females of their house. Government should make laws stronger for the protection of women from trafficking, and their forceful involvement in this trade of prostitution. And even prostitution will lead to many health problems like HIV, STDs etc.Legalization of prostitution in no way will move towards the development of the country. Rather government should take steps for the empowerment of women and contribute for their education so that women could earn money and respect.[1]Dr. Smt. S. R.

    "data": "This article has been written by Heena Jalan, a student of School of Law, KIIT University.Child Abuse is a multidimensional term colloquially used to describe an act of physical, mental, neglect and sexual exploitation inflicted primarily on a child further characterized by injuries such as bruises, fractures that result from hitting, punching, kicking beating, etc. interfering with a child’s mental health or social development, rape, molestation, neglect treatment, over discipline, sexual exploitation, sodomy, extreme forms of punishment, verbal insult, rejection, belittling, terrorizing, etcetera. A child is a boy/girl below the age of 18. These are the four kinds of abuse that have been recognized worldwide. The violence can be induced on the child in homes, schools, residential care institutions, prisons, workplaces, care centers, factories, on streets. Such abuse is not recognized in one episode but is an outcome of a series of episodes. In India, child abuse is one of the most understudied occurrences but yet it is most prevalent due to the established society and family norms. Other factors that facilitate child abuse in India are poverty, overcrowding, unemployment, lack of education, lack of awareness, lack of appropriate legislation, plenty of street children, extended family living arrangements, lack of recreational facilities etcetera. Therefore, numerous ecological, situational, psychological factors, and a wide array of conditions circle ultimately leading to an upsurge in child abuse cases in India.India has recognized the importance of criminalizing activities of sexual harassment, sexual exploitation, rape, sodomy, molestation against children below the age of 18. Originally, child sexual abuse was not publicly acknowledged as a crime in India, Later, in 2012 the parliament enacted new legislation called the Protection of Children against Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO Act). The act was enacted to address the criminal offenses perpetrated against children of both genders by perpetrators and to also sanction stringent punishments. Though this act has been enacted there are major impediments in the implementation of the same. The act requires dedicated and harmonized determinations for the appropriate implementation since it is a very sensitive piece of legislation. With this enactment, the report of such cases has seen an upsurge in numbers and the same is due to awareness.But another essential question that arises under the same phenomena is the mental health of the child. It raises countless questions in the minds of an individual. As to what happens to the mental health of the child-victim? Is punishing the perpetrator the only remedial justice that the government can provide? The central government shall ensure involvement in nurturing the minds of the children who are the victims of such heinous crimes. The government shall promulgate appropriate laws concerning the mental health and mental status of the child. The government can set up proper medical and care facilities employing medical doctors for the same cause and set up recreational and vocational facilities/hospitals to ensure that the child has restored its sanity back. Here, punishing the perpetrator is not the only curative justice that the government can provide. The government has to take initiatives for the overall development of the victim-child and ensure that the child has access to a better world. The government requires an enthusiastic and committed set of individuals to implement mental health provisions for such children since it is also the right of such children to have access to a better lifestyle, education, and shelter. It is high time for the government to acknowledge that mental health is also an actual problem among these children which has to be considered. "

    "headline": "False Promise of Marriage- Rape?Drastic Changes in Advocates Act 1961TURKEY PASSES A NEW LAW ON OVERSIGHT OF ASSOCIATIONS- AN INFORMATIVE INSIGHTDo you know the difference between Civil and Criminal Administration of Justice?",
    "data": "This article has been written by Heena Jalan, a student of KIIT University, School of Law.India is modeled on a society that is exceptionally orthodox, conservative, and traditional. Marriage for Indians is a formal society-approved sacred ceremony between two individuals which is also a formal approval of permitting them to have sexual intercourse. Sexual intercourse out/before marriage is criticized and is perceived as something which is contrary to the ethical, moral values and standards of the society. Here the institution of marriage gives the “CONSENT” to have sexual intercourse.But what happens when a man fails to marry a woman regardless of an already existing promise and the existence of a sexual relationship between them? Does it mean that the man is guilty of Rape and does it attract the provisions of rape under Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code?Also, is there a difference between breach of promise and false promise?Clarifying the legal position, recently the Supreme Court ruled that if a man fails to marry a woman regardless of an already existing promise and there is an existence of a sexual relationship between them, then the man will not be guilty of rape only if it is established/proved by the prosecutrix that:Also in cases where the man has expressed his hesitations about marrying the woman but they still endure their sexual relationship, it certainly implies that the woman is giving her consent/approval and therefore it can be warranted that the man is not guilty of rape. In 2014, according to a survey, approximately 25% of the rape cases that were filed with the Delhi trial court dealt with “breach of promise to marry”.A man is guilty of breach of promise when due to certain events, circumstances, or situations the man was incapable/unable to consummate the promise made. Here, the foundation of the promise was not made in bad faith. Instead, a false promise noticeably connotes that promise was bad in faith and the intentions were to deceive the woman and establish a sexual relationship on a false pretext of marrying her. However, where a woman makes a rational choice and further acts on it after assessing all the alterations and consequences amounting from such action, inactions, it is said that the woman has made a reasoned choice.The Indian Express in an article stated that the city of Bengaluru has seen an upsurge in cases of rape on false promises of marriage, with an average of seven cases per month.In Sujit Ranjan vs. State, Delhi High Court observed that consent given by the prosecutrix to engage in sexual relations with whom she is in love, on a promise that he would marry her in future, cannot be considered as given under a misconception of fact. The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in Anurag Soni vs. the State of Chhattisgarh, held that “from the very inception, the promise given by the accused to marry the prosecutrix was a false promise and from the very beginning there was no intention to marry the prosecutrix as his marriage with Priyanka Soni was already fixed long back and, despite the same, he continued to give promise/false promise and alluded the prosecutrix to give her consent for the physical relationship. Therefore, considering the aforesaid facts and circumstances of the case, the same cannot be said to be consent. The accused was convicted for the offense under Section 376 of the IPC.”Hence, their cases are to be scrutinized judicially with utmost precaution and empathy since pre-marital sex is a taboo in India for women. Women have been educated that virginity is the most valued possession a woman has. The law ought to be relooked into otherwise we might land up inflicting an excessive injury on the actual victim’s reputation and life. The promise of the marriage was false, given in bad faith and with no intention of being obeyed, at the time it was made.The woman consented/agreed to have a sexual relationship with the man only on the basis of the promise made by him at that time. This bears a direct nexus/connection to the women’s decision to engage in sexual intercourse."

    "data": "This article has been written by Barkha, from JEMTEC School of Law.Reproduction is important for, life to continue on earth. Every living organism is made in a way so that it can reproduce and, proceed his/her generation further. If there was no process of reproduction there would have been end of life on the planet. But with this basic process of reproduction, a society emerged with civilisation. In earlier times, it was believed that the only reason behind getting married it to give birth to children and create a new generation in order to continue human existence on earth. This need of reproduction has eventually led us to population explosion but people’s desire to have children is still continued.Almost every human being is obsessed with producing their progeny, to develop their next generation. It is said that children bring happiness to the life of the parents and the family. And in order to fulfil this desire, people try everything they can.In this modern world, role of technology in daily lives of people is at peak. With each day passing by, technology is becoming more and more advanced. With the help of technology,any couple who is unable to produce children can continue their genes. These technologies are referred as ART (Assisted Reproductive Technologies), these technologies include, test tube babies, in-vitro fertilisation, in-vivo fertilisation, intracytoplasmic sperm injection, freezing of eggs and many more.[1] One of those technologies is surrogacy. The process of surrogacy is used when any female who is unable to produce eggs, or her womb is unable to bear the baby. This technique is sometimes supported by a legal agreement, where any fertile and competent female called as surrogate mother, agrees with infertile couple to bear their baby in her womb and return to her after the birth of the child.In this process, egg and sperm is taken from the intending parents and they are fused in the lab and then the embryo is implantedin the womb of the surrogate mother.[2] In the completion of this process, surrogate mother has to go through lot of artificial hormone injections, many hormonal changes which are not natural. This technique can somewhere lead to the exploitation of the surrogate mother. This exploitation can be physically and emotionally. These artificial hormone changes cause a lot of bad effects on a human body and many health issues. As it is quite obvious, some unnatural functions which are forced on any human body, can prove to be harmful.This technology was created to reduce the suffering of infertile couples and give them blessing of children but somehow it turned out to be a business. Situations like poverty, unemployment, and education of children compel women to be surrogate mothers.[3]Sometimes, children born through surrogacy are abandoned. A similar case was arrived in India, Baby Manji Yamada V. Union Of India &Anr on 29 September, 2008[4], in this case a doctor arranged facility of surrogacy for a Japanese couple who was infertile, Ikufumi and Yuki Yamada, to have baby by surrogate motherPritiben Mehta. Whole procedure was done in the lab, in the process eggs of Pritiben Mehta were used. During the pregnancy phase, the couple filed for divorce. Any of the Indian law did not cover, who was the legal mother of the new born baby, Pritiben or Yuki Amanda. Although, baby was later given to her grandmother Emiko. From this case, it is evident that surrogacy can lead to easy abandonment of children.[5]These can lead to the rise of social evil like physical exploitation of surrogate mother for money, abandonment of children, child trafficking, and supply of girlsborn through surrogacy for prostitution.To stop all these evils, there is requirement of framing and proper regulation ofstrict laws. There should be proper guidelines to use such techniques. In order to make strict laws regarding surrogacy, government of India introduced Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill, 2016. In this Bill, so many laws and guidelines were issued. The Bill contained 51 sections which gave brief explanationregarding, regulation of surrogacy clinics, regulation of surrogacy and surrogacy procedure, registration of surrogacy clinics, constitution of National Surrogacy Board, appointment of appropriate authority, offences and penalties, and other laws. The main features of this Surrogacy (Regulation) Bill ,2016 are:These were some major features of the Bill. It was introduced to make more strict laws, related to surrogacy, to stop exploitation of women (surrogate mother) and children born out of surrogacy.But this Bill somehow failed to mention appropriate laws for everyone, as it has been mentioned legally married Indian couple. Laws for LGBTQ community and for live-in couples are absent.[18]There is no option to have baby with the help of surrogacy for gays, lesbians, single parent, foreigners, and couples with children. In this aspect, this Bill failed to be flexible and modern. Due to such strictness of laws, single parents would not be able to proceed their genes to next generation. All married couple who are unable to conceive would have to wait for at least 5 years to go for surrogacy. As to be declared as biologically infertile, there should be unprotected mating for at least five years. It would take lot of time and suffering to the couples who are actually needy. In the Bill, it has also been mentioned that, only close relative of intending couple can opt to be surrogate mother, this clause makes this law ambiguous, as it has not been mentioned that what is the definition of close relative, who would be considered as close relative. Moreover, it would be difficult for couples to get consent of any married relative to be surrogate mother. It could be difficult for intending couple to fulfil all the conditions mentioned in the Bill.This law limits the possibility to give birth to a new life.This Bill has been framed keeping in consideration, all the social issues. Although, couples can go for adoption of orphans. And even population explosion is at its boom, which is actually leading to unemployment, poverty and other issues. Because of this technology, women are allowing to get their bodies exploited, for some money. Keeping all the factors in mind, it was crucial to frame such strict laws related to surrogacy. But in this modern and progressive world, where everything is becoming liberal and more modern with time. There is requirement of laws which are flexible enough to meet the demands of modern society. Allowing only married couple to have the facility of surrogacy is not a move towards being a modern but an orthodox move. Access to this facility should also be allowed to live-in couples, LGBTQ community and single parents as well. This Bill can also lead to exploitation of some couples, who are already suffering in process of getting certificate and other requirements for the same. The couples would also have to wait for 5 years to get the benefit of this technology. Many laws mentioned in this Bill were required to have control over the issues. But there are many laws which can be proved to be rhetoric in nature. This Bill could be improved by providing more flexible rules keeping in mind other communities and requirement of this modern world.

    "headline": "Vishakha guidelines: an enterprise to reduce workplace harassment of women.Survivor-Centric Approach towards Rape Victims Is Need of the Hour: SCRight to Information: Evolution and Recent SetbacksNDA’s Presidential Candidate: Ram Nath Kovind a Dalit Crusader",
    "data": "This article has been written by Barkha, from JEMTEC School of Law.Sexual harassment is something which has been experienced by almost every woman. Violence against women and harassment is very big social issue. Woman in no place is safe, they are harassed on empty roads, at the market, in their houses and their workplace as well. There is a requirement to frame laws to control such activity. Similar to this, a case was arrived which is commonly known as BanwariDevi Case. In this case, a Dalit woman, Banwari Devi was employed for Rajasthan Government’s women’s development program. Bhanwaridevi’s job was to make people aware about hygiene, family planning and importance of educating girls. She also used to conduct campaigns about female feticide, infanticide, dowry and child marriage. Once she went on a campaign to prevent marriage of a 9-month-old gujjar girl child. In the course of her work, she was raped by 5 ‘gujjars’ as punishment for preventing child marriage.[1]So many movements started to seek justice for BhanwariDevi, she was harassed at her work place. The protests were focused mainly on harassment in workplace. Many campaigns were conducted and government was pressurized to provide justice and make guidelines to prevent sexual harassment at workplace.It was stated that, police did not take her complaints seriously. Proper investigation was not done, all the evidences were not collected. Police kept on delaying the procedure. Things became so bad when those 5 ‘gujjar’ men were acquitted, they were set free even after committing such crime.[2] The law in the country needs to be strict. Many women fail to get justice, just because of the loose investigation and delaying of the case.Later a 4 women organization, filed a petition before the Supreme Court to setup guidelines for sexual harassment at workplace. The organizations were, Vishakha and Women’s Rehabilitation Group from Rajasthan and Jagori and Kali for Women from Delhi. Later the guidelines came to be known as vishakha guidelines. After all the protests and the public interest litigation, the Supreme Court then issuedvishakha guidelines for sexual harassment at workplace. At the time of commission of the Bhanwari Lal Case, there was no specific law for the protection of the women at workplace.Vishakha guidelines, redefined the definition of workplace. As Rajasthan government refused to accept the fact that she was at her workplace, when she was raped. The definition of work place was also vague. It was stated that it is the duty of the government to make sure that the workplace was secure for her. In guidelines for workplaces, the basic obligation was prohibition, prevention and redress. It was given that every institution shall set up an internal complaint committee (ICC) to address the matters of sexual harassment.Sexual harassment at workplace actually includes, any kind of physical contact or advances, any demand or request for sexual favours, sexually coloured remarks, showing pornography, any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature, or any sexual related remarks. All these would come under sexual harassment. A complaint can be filed for such conduct. Later, women and child development ministry, issued a handbook which defined sexual harassment broadly. These included:The scope was broadened in other way as well that, it is not compulsory that the complaint should only be filed by the victim. It can be filed by anybody else as well. Talking about the time limit, it has been guided that complaint should be filed within 3 months of the incident. But it can be extended in certain cases, depending on the situation as the ICC may consider fit.After the filing of the complaint, the ICC may forward the complaint under section 509[4] of The Indian Penal Code, 1860, or may conduct inquiry on their own, the enquiry has to be conducted within 90 days of the complaint. ICC holds same power as that of civil judge in matter of summoning and examining any person on oath, requiring discovery and production of the document.Once the investigation is complete, ICC has to provide the finding of the report to the employer within 10 days. And make it available to both the parties.[5]If the complaint is found to be false, the complainant would be punished under Section 14 of the act under, malicious prosecution.These were the basic guidelines which was issued by the Supreme Court. This guideline was further supported by the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act, 2013.This act further broadened the scope of vishakha guidelines. Now all these matters are mainly governed by this Act only. This act makes it compulsory to have any Internal Complaint Committee (ICC), if any employer has 10 or more than 10 employees. It defines various aspects of sexual harassment and provides protection to working women.The movement which was done after the Bhanwari Devi case, made people aware about the harassment at workplace and need to issue strict guidelines, to create safe environment for women. Although, Bhanwari Devi, she never received justice, her rapists are still free. A case which resulted in so much revolt, and lead to the creation of Vishakha guidelines. The same woman could not get justice. Even after advancement of the laws, there are so many women who do not receive justice. There is requirement to make better judicial and legal system, so that each and every woman can get justice. [1]Smt.

    "data": "This article has been written by Barkha, from JEMTEC School of Law.Nirbhaya case, a gangrape case occurred in Munirka, near south Delhi. This incident took place on 16th, December, 2012. A 23 years old, physiotherapy intern was brutally gang raped in a private bus when she was going home after watching a movie, with her friend. There were 6 people in the bus including the bus driver, out of whom everyone raped her and the friend of the girl was also beaten. They assaulted her and caused some serious injuries in her private parts with an iron rod. After being brutally raped she was thrown on road naked, bleeding, her intestine spilling out the body. After 11 days of treatment, when she was being shifted to Singapore for further treatment, she died. Among the 6 rapist there was a juvenile as well. This case was one of the most heinous crimes occurred ever. This incident got so much publicity; this news spread from national to international platforms. There were several candle marches conducted to demand justice. Many protests were alsoheld.Out of all those 6 rapists, one was minor (few months short to be 18) who was prosecuted under Juvenile Justice Act, 2000, and he was given punishment of maximum 3 years, in a reform facility. Other rapist committed suicide under police custody on 11th, March 2013 in Tihar Jail. On 10th, September 2013, the four remaining accused were proved guilty of rape and Murder, by speedy trial court. Later, the High Court heard the case, and upheld the decision of the trial court, death sentence. Further, petition was filed in the Supreme Court, it took one and a half year for the apex Court to constitute a bench for hearing. On 25th, August, 2013, it was uploaded on the website of the Supreme Court, that there is a requirement of at least 3 judges in a bench. In 2017, the Supreme Court upheld the decision of capital punishment. According to law, any convict can file a plea for review of the verdict within 30 days. But there is an exception to the same, if there is any convincing reason behind the same it can be delayed. All the accused filed review after six months to after one and a half year. In their petition, they gave absurd and bizarre reasons, talked about ‘Vedas’ and ‘Puranas’ and reduction of life expectancy of human beings. It was stated that “Earlier the life expectancy of humans was 100 years but now the life expectancy of humans has already reduced to 50-70 years, what is the point behind death sentence”. It was also stated that “as Delhi is like a gas chamber, people are automatically going to die.” All these contentions were made in the petition, all the petitions were rejected by the Supreme Court. During their imprisonment, they also broke prison rules 23 times. They laterfiled their mercy plea before the president of India which was also rejected. After all these petitions and delay games, they were finally hanged to death on 20th, March, 2020.[1]Focusing on the time period, which took to provide justice to a girl and her family. After committing such a heinous crime, those criminals survived for 8 years. The family of the victim had to fight for 8 years to get justice. After looking at this scenario, a question arises how efficient are the criminal laws of this country, where such criminals managed to delay their hanging for several years. It is clear that, there is requirement to frame stronger laws. After commission of this Nirbhaya case, people protested to provide justice to Nirbhaya and make stronger laws. The questions which arises are, what are the changes which have been made to make judicial system more efficient, how government has worked to make sure that such cases would not occur? What are the laws which has been changed and is there any reduction in the commission of such crimes?After the Nirbhaya case, there were many changes made in the Indian legal system. An attempt was made to make laws stricter to prevent such crimes. Following are the changes which have been made to make system better:These were the law amendments made after the Nirbhaya case, an attempt was made to improve judicial system.But as we look at the scenario after Nirbhaya case, 16th, December, 2012, it has nowhere changed. The rate of rape cases is increasing at a high pace. Changes in the laws has nowhere contributed in the prevention of rape cases. Heinous rape cases like Dr Priyanka Reddy, a woman raped twice in a day and burnt alive are still occurring. Women are not safe even in their houses, they are raped by their relatives, husbands, fathers, brothers and uncles. Girls of every age group from 6 months to 80 years are raped. Due to the perception of the society many rape cases are not even reported, because of women’s reputation. Women are raped and they keep quite and forget everything, without taking any action against the rapist.Current legal system is failing in preventing crimes. In situation like this where violence against women isso high, we require very strong laws and its proper implementation. Along with making laws stronger, proper sex education should be provided to young generation. Self defense lessons should be compulsory in every school or organization in the country. It’s a high time when we require strong legal and judicial system and safe place for women. Strict action by the government and law makers is required.[1]Mukesh &Anr.V. State for N.C.T.

It is planned to establish around 1,023 fast track courts.[2]Due to abundance of cases, there are many pending hearings in the court of law, which is leading to further delays in the announcement of verdicts. To make judicial system more efficient there was requirement to establish fast track courts, to provide justice to the victims in short time period.The definition of section 375 of The Indian Penal Code, 1860 i.e. rape was broadened. A broader definition of consent was introduced in the law. The definition of rape was also defined again, now it not only include vaginal penetration but forcible penetration by any man of penis, in any part of the body of the woman, including mouth, urethra, anus as well. Any kind of non-penetrative act would now be considered as sexual assault. Age consent was also increased from 16 to 18. The scope of law was also increased as rape of any women under 16 years of age is considered to be aggravated and therefore, provide higher punishment. Separate provision for repeated offenders was also introduced.[3]Certain changes in the procedure of the investigation were also brought, if any woman reported about rape case, such reported shall be noted by the female police officer, and in certain cases, at whatever place the victim is comfortable. Such information shall be video graphed and presented before the magistrate. It also abolished two- finger test, which somewhere lead to mental exploitation of the woman raped.[4]One of the biggest changes which were made was, punishment of marital rape. In this orthodox society, it is believed that if a man is married to a woman, he got certificate to have sex with her, whenever he wants. But any penetration which is done without the consent of the woman is rape. Hence, punishment for the same has been defined under section 376A of The Indian Penal Code, 1860, which extends to two years of imprisonment. And even special provision has been defined for rape by men who were in fiduciary relationship (relationship of trust, any relative) with the victim.[5]In any law, there is some kind of presumption, in The Indian Evidence Act, 1872, section 114A, it is stated that if any woman shows in her evidence that she had not consented, it would be presumed that her consent was not given.[6]"

    "headline": "DIGITALIZATION OF COURT PROCEEDINGS: – A NEW WAY TO INDIAN JUDICIARYCOVID -19: Quarantine and your Legal RightsThe Indian Legal Legend: Fali S Nariman﻿Do you think that the ban on TikTok makes sense?",
    "data": "This Article has been written by Bhavya Verma,studying LL.B. in JEMTEC, School of law and Curated by Rasveen Kaur Kapoor of Indore Institute of Law.Undoubtedly, Covid-19, that caught hold of the entire planet, stunned the litigants, lawyers, judges and justice administrators consummately. The outbreak of the novel strain of Coronavirus (Covid-19) recalibrated the Indian Judiciary, and proved that recalibration is hopefully possible if we have the political will and a course of action to digitalize the courts, from roots up. It served to be an opportunity in crisis. Also, a renowned British author, Richard Susskind, anticipated the inevitability of electronic courts in the years ahead.Though, digitalization of court proceedings is widely accepted in the Indian Courts due to Covid-19 pandemic but long term application of conducting court proceedings via video conferencing may have some challenges.For e-filing and hearing video conferencing, recently the honorable Supreme Court issued guidelines regards Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) for High Courts and District Courts which provides the link to detailed e-filing procedure that eliminates the need for clerks or counsels to physically approach the filing counter. In the wake of the guidelines and SOP issued by the Supreme Court, various High Courts have adopted a conforming procedure.The advocates and litigants are gradually familiarizing themselves with the video conferencing apps such as Jitsi Meet and Vidyo applications. Only those matters which are deemed to be of extreme importance, designated by the Registrar were to be put up for hearing which included bail matters. On 18th April 2020, the honorable Supreme Court expanded the types of matters to be taken up for hearings by the consent of the parties thus miniscule matters pertaining to family laws and death penalty which can be dealt by video conferencing may be taken up by the consent of the parties.The biggest hurdle in the full-fledged digitalization of the courts is that the proceedings will not be open for the public to witness as being held in camera or virtually which is against the requirements of natural justice. Also, the kinds of matters which can be suitably adjudicated by the courts are limited.Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 defines the term evidence which the court permits or requires including electronic documents. In the case of Umar Abdul Sakoor Sorathia v. Intelligence Officer, MC Bureau, the honorable Supreme Court allowed the identification via photograph but such identification might not constitute substantive evidence. Also, in the case of Bishwanath Prasad v. Dwarka Prasad the apex court declared that the admissibility regards the evidence has to be substantive evidence of the fact.Section 17 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 defines admission as a statement oral or documentary or contained in electronic form. In the case of Income Tax Officer v. Mangat Ram Norata Ram the honorable Supreme Court held that the admission implied by conduct is strong and best evidence against the maker but he is at liberty to prove that such admission was mistaken or untrue. Also, in the matter of Joshna Gouda Brundabande held that for the admission to be valid such admission should be clear and unambiguous.Under section 62 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 the documents submitted as original are considered primary evidence and any copy without physical submission would be secondary evidence.Under section 138 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 the examination of the witnesses has to be done in a free and fair manner without undue influence and coercion but through video conferencing the independence of witness’ testimony can be questioned. The complexities of recording and admission of the evidences cannot be held in video conferencing as no application or cloud has yet been designated for recording and digitally storing the information in a neutral space, in tune with the requirements under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. For expanding the ambit of video conferencing in criminal trials and video conferencing there would be a dire need to expand the infrastructure so as to facilitate recording of witness’ testimony at locations that can be certified as being protected against undue pressure or coercion. Inspection of the evidences will continue to pose a challenge.The recording of cross examinations and examination in chief, especially in criminal matters becomes challenging for the proceedings held via video conferencing. Recording of evidence in criminal trials often requires frequent communication with the client and observing the body language and mannerism of the witnesses. The right to cross examination in criminal matters is a crucial right and integral to the concept of natural justice and fair trial.All aspects of digitized court proceedings shall encapsulate the following: Meet the requirements under the Indian Evidence Act, 1872Should not be violative of the procedure established by law enshrined under Article 21 of the Constitution of India.Should not put litigants under any financial burden.Civil Procedure Code, Criminal Procedure Code and the Information Technology Act should be amended to enable a comprehensive digitization of court procedures.Adherence to the principles of natural justice, good conscience and equity."

    "headline": "The Rule of Best Evidence in Criminal JurisprudenceMr. Harish Salve, A Lawyer Par ExcellenceMens rea : A demon of senseRECENT MODIFICATIONS AND JUDGMENTS IN AUTOMOBILE SECTOR",
    "data": "This Article has been written by RIYA KAUSHIK studying LL.B. in GEETA INSTITUTE OF LAW and Curated by NAMAN JAIN of Bennett University.Evidence is a fact, sign, or a document that makes us believe that something is real. The Law of Evidence is also known as the Rule of Evidence. These are the rules or legal principles which govern the proof of facts in legal proceedings. These are also related to the type of evidence. These pieces of evidence are quantum or quality, which is required to prove the facts in litigation. The rules vary from court to court, i.e., whether it is a Criminal Court, Civil Court or Family Court, and the Jurisdiction of the Court.The Rule of Best Evidence is a Legal principle that holds that the original document is a superior Evidence. It holds that the copy of the original document is not admissible if an original document exists and can be obtained. The rule has its roots in 18th century British Law. It states that as long as you have a piece of superior evidence to prove it, no inferior evidence will be presented before the court.The Rule of Best Evidence is the foundation of the criminal justice system. This Rule has great importance in criminal trials. An accused is considered innocent until proven guilty, and the guilt of the accused has to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt on the basis of Best Possible Evidence and not on the basis of hypothetical arguments.The Best Evidence Rule is the preference of courts, which includes original writings, recordings, and photographs rather than its copies. Copies work a secondary source when the facts have to be proved, whereas the purpose of the Best Evidence Rule is to avoid potential accuracy, which can be present in Handmade copies.The question to be considered is that why a Secondary Source should be used as evidence when at the same time, Original Evidence is available or can be accessed?The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Roop Kumar V. Mohan Thedani, held that “admitting inferior evidence when the law requires superior evidence, would amount to nullifying the law.”In India, the Best Evidence Rule is regarded as the Fundamental Principle upon which The Law of Evidence is based. Although the Best Evidence Rule is not explicitly mentioned in the Indian Evidence Act 1872, S. 91 & 92 of the IEA provides the base for it.Over a period, this Rule has faced many practical limitations on obtaining and producing the original copy of the document. Nowadays, most of the information is stored through electronic devices, and the original copy of it is the hardcopy of the same. If the litigant wants to present them in a court, then to satisfy the Rule, he must produce the original printout copy to the court; however, its authenticity is questionable.The exceptions to this Rule are-Once the party shows that any of the exceptions discussed above is applicable in their case, then the secondary evidence can be used.The court has the discretion to refuse the applicability of this Rule when no meaningful purpose of producing the original evidence is found.The Best Evidence Rule should not be used as a rigid option, however, it should be used as a guide to choose the appropriate method of proof. Its applicability should be based on the nature of the case.In criminal cases, the necessity of the circumstances must be proven based on absolute facts and evidence. Any failure in producing the best evidence makes the prosecution vulnerable to an adverse inference being drawn against it. Moreover, it can lead to injustice, which can only be avoided if the Best Evidence is available. The Rule does not apply only to the written documents but also to oral testimonies and witnesses. Thus, the advocates must produce the best possible evidence to establish the case against the wrongdoer, and any failure to it can make the proceedings doubtful and can lead to injustice. 91 of the IEA states that the original document should be produced for proving the contents related to contracts, grants, or other dispositions. However, it does not prohibit to adduce some evidence in a case; the deed is capable of being construed in a different way, which is understandable. Further, S. 92 excludes the evidence of oral agreements.When the original documents are destroyed or lost.When it is not possible to produce the original copy by any means.When the original document is in the hold of the party against whom it has to be used.When the writing, recording, or photograph is not closely related to the controlling issue in the case."

    "headline": "Honour Killing: A Judicial ApproachMoney Laundering Online Sexual Violence Won’t Go UnpunishedCLAT RESULTS 2019",
    "data": "This article has been written by Barkha, from JEMTEC School of Law.Since the civilisation of society, when people moved from caves to homes, they have always defined some kind of norms related to almost everything. They decided certain rules, which are to followed by everyone. Even deciding, whom an individual should love. Being it, concealing their insensible and pointless rules, by calling it rule of nature, as in the case of LGBTQ community. According to them, it is the rule of nature that a man should love a woman only and vice-versa. Similarly, they decided 4 castes on their own, and made a rule that people should marry within the same caste. And if they fail to follow this rule, they will be killed. This primitive thinking of people, is still prevailing in the society. Now it is known as honour killing. Honour killing is basically killing of people in the name of honour, to protect the prestige of the family. It is believed that if any person is getting married to any person of different caste, or did any other work which is in violation of the societal rules, they have outraged the modesty of the family and shall be killed. Honour killing has been a serious issue from a very long time. It is still continued, although in today’s world some people are aware about the issue, and the court is framing laws for the same.Some reasons which lead to this honour killing may be, marriage out of caste, inter religion marriage, or loving someone of same gender, pregnancy before marriage, inappropriate dressing etc. Honour killing is practiced in almost every part of the world. It was reported by the United Nations, that 5,000 women became victim of honour killing in the year 2000.[1] Although, it exists in almost every part of the world, India has reported the highest number of cases. This act of honour killing is mostly practiced in villages of Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Punjab, Rajasthan, Delhi. Punjab reports highest number of cases, due to the presence of ‘Khap Panchayat’ or ‘Caste panchayat’. Places where freedom is not provided to people, to do whatever they want, marry whoever they want. In the earlier times, people were killed on the name of honour killing, and it was not even known to people, they were killed silently, and most of them were reported as suicide or accident. Which makes it difficult to keep a count on such cases of honour killing. There is no codified law, pertaining the cases of honour killing.[2] There are some provisions which can be applied to case of honour killing.These are the provisions violated when any case of honour killing occurs. But there is no special enacted and coded law on honour killing, people have been committing it to set an example that, if theydo anything which is against their rules, they will be punished and killed. But judiciary has certainly given some judgement related to honour killing.There are series of decisions which has been passed by the judiciary, to provide justice to the people who have been killed, in the name of honour killing. On 21st June, 2011, justice R.M. Lodha and J.K. Patnaik, issued a notice, for some states to make appropriate laws on the issue, after a petition filed by an NGO named ‘Shakti Vahini’. In many criminal matters, judiciary has many times punished the offenders for the offence of honour killing like in the case, Uttar Pradesh vs. Krishna Master and Others[3], in which Supreme Court awarded life imprisonment to the murderer of 3 people’s, 6 family members. The court has recognised the cruelty of this offence. In another case, Lata Singh v. State of U.P. and Another[4], it was held by the court that such kind of acts i.e. torturing someone is wholly illegal and the offenders, shall be punished.In a landmark judgement, Shakti Vahini Vs. UOI[5], Supreme Court of India, held that this violence in the name of honour, it is not only a criminal matter but a matter of violation of fundamental right, given under Article 21 and Article 19(1)(a) of The Constitution of India, which provides right to life and right to speech and expression. This judgement gives emphasis on the recognition of the intensity of this heinous crime, and punishment to be given accordingly.After the judicial precedent which has been set by the Supreme Court. It would be followed by all inferior court all over the country. People have been harassed and tortured in the name of the customs and rules, by some strangers and in some cases by their own families. Everyone has right to live his/her life with zero intervention of others and freedom. These laws made by the society are insensible and there is no point in following such laws. Killing someone just by claiming that they have outraged the reputation of their family, is a barbaric. Strong laws must be enacted by the legislature for the crime of honour killing.Laws should be codified to make them more substantiate.[1]Matthew A Goldstein.

    "data": "This article is written by Anushka Sharma from Delhi Metropolitan Education, GGSIPU, and curated by Sahana Arya.Data protection law are set of laws based on protecting consumers or users from usage of harmful data. Around the world, the cases of cybercrimes have touched skies and sometimes it is very difficult to find the culprit behind the crime.These laws secure data from getting it accommodated by attackers from outside and the insiders which are malicious in nature.In the 21st century, data is one of the most important commodities. Data are classified into two types: Public and Private- Public data are the ones which can be accessed by public at large, for example- court records, death record, birth record, basic details of the person, etc. whereas private details are the information which is very private to the person and cannot be accessed without prior permission, for example- financial details, family details, browsing details, etc.Currently, India does not have a proper legislation based solely on data protection but there is a regulation mechanism for data protection and privacy which is the Information Technology Act,2001 (IT ACT) and its parallel Information Technology( Reasonable Security Practices and Procedure and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules,2011(IT Rules). Additionally, personal data is also protected under Article 21 of the Constitution of India, it guaranties to every citizen a right to privacy as a fundamental right. The Apex Court of India in various cases held that information about a person and the right to access that information by that person is also covered within the ambit of right to privacy.The data protection law in India is currently facing limitations due to lack of proper legislation. India lacks an express legislation dealing with data protection.Data protection law is very necessary as the purpose of protecting personal data is not just to safeguard a person’s data but also to the fundamental right and freedom of that person to protect his privacy from any invasion.Secondly, without a proper legislation on data protection, there can be rise in cyber crimes and other data/technology related crimes.Thirdly, data is becoming a very valuable asset and the invasion of the same can lead to major loss for an individual, company and sometimes even a country.Fourthly, these laws provide a framework for rules and guidance which can be followed by an organization and the government.It has been argued that despite advances made recently in legislations and practices related to data privacy, there are consumers who reported invasion of their data regularly by external attackers who are breaching the right of privacy of the consumer.There can be various ways through which consumer can protect their data-In India, Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018 controls the collection of personal data of any individual by any private entities or government organization.The organizing is allowed only after receiving a consent from the consumer or in case of medical emergencies, the state can use it for providing benefits.There are some exemptions where the government can be allowed to access to the data of the individual. For example- In cases of interests of natural securities, for media/ journalism purposes, and for legal proceedings. As a consumer, you need to make sure that your data is not getting stored by any company and try to avoid sharing it more than required.As a citizen, one should avoid into the practice of stealing of data."

    "headline": "CRIME AGAINST WOMENAre Pulses Food Grains? Answers Delhi High CourtETHICAL IMPLICATIONS OF USING ONLINE MEETINGPUSH-BACKS AT THE CHANNELS: REFUGEES IN CRISIS",
    "data": "This article has been written by Barkha, from JEMTEC School of Law.Crimes are increasing with time. Crime is a big issue in almost every part of the world. Governments all over the world are trying to make more and more strict laws to prevent crimes. In this patriarchal society, crimes against women have always existed, and it has continued to increase with time. There areseveral crimes which are being committed against women, the reason could be that, from the very civilisation of this society, women are considered to be weaker than men, due to which they have been exploiting women. Even women have always tolerated such exploitation, which has led to the increase of these crimes.Almost every woman has experienced such exploitation. There are many crimes which can be committed against women, these can be rape, dowry, sexual harassment, women trafficking for prostitution, eve teasing, molestation, cyber crimes against women and many more. These crimes are increasing at high pace, although laws are framed by the government to prevent these crimes, but proper implementation to such laws are required. Incapacity of legal judicial system is making people fearless, and people commit those crime without any fear.The crimes against women which are prevailing in the society are:It is one the biggest problems in our society. Women are nowhere safe. Women are raped so brutally. The reason which is leading in the increase of such cases is our orthodox society, which never blames the rapist but the victim. Women are blamed for the rape which may be, her clothes, her way of talking, if they have male friends. Men are never blamed. Women from all age groups from 6 months to 80 years, get raped. Women are even raped by their relatives, fathers, brothers and husbands.Gravity of such crimes can be witnessed from many rape cases. We can take example of Nirbhaya gangrape case, a case in which a girl was raped in a private bus when she was going home with her friend. She was brutally raped by 6 men, out of whom one was juvenile. She suffered many injuries during the rape. They injured her by putting an iron rod in her private parts. And after raping her beating her, they threw her out of the running bus. She was left on the road naked, bleeding, and her intestine spilling out.[1] There were many amendments made in rape law after Nirbhaya case, 2012, as punishment for rape is given in section 375of Indian Penal Code, 1860.The scope of definition of rape was broadened. It included, provisions for marital rape as well. As in this patriarchal society it is believed that, if any man is married to a woman, he got certified to have sex with her, even without her consent. But for any sexual act the consent of women is required every single time. Hence, any male, who tries to have sexual intercourse with her wife without her consent, would be punished.But even after broadening the scope of all the laws and making them strict, there is no change in the commission of such crimes. The rate of rape cases is increasing day by day and more and more heinous crimes are being committed. There is no relief for women in any manner.Dowry, when any woman gets married to a man, dowry is given as a gift to the family of man. It is a serious issue, where family of the girl is pressurised to give high amount of money to the family of the boy. This custom of dowry is prevailing in our society from ancient period. This not only a custom but a type of exploitation. It goes to such extent where family of the girl have to take loan to give dowry to in-laws of the girl. This, many times lead to dowry death. Girls are beaten in their matrimonial house, they are exploited. This greed lead to domestic violence. Women are also subjected to physical and cruelty. They are even murdered for the greed of dowry. Many laws have been framed to stop this social evil named dowry.Taking and giving of dowry is illegal in India, although giving some gifts are permitted. Dowry is prohibited under Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961.Section 498A of Indian Penal Code provides for punishment of any kind of cruelty with women. Cruelty is beating or mentally torturing women. Section 304B of Indian Penal Code, provides punishment for dowry death. If any woman, within the 7 years of marriage, dies and her dead is caused by any bodily injury, burn or any kind of unnatural death, the family of the groom can be prosecuted for dowry death. Even after such strict laws, this evil is not eliminated from our society. And dowry is still taken and given in the name of gifts. And women are still exploited.Trafficking is taking of any person illegally, against her/ his consent for purpose of begging, forced work or sex work. Sex racquet is prevalent in almost every part of the world. According to united Nations, more than 4 million women and girls are trafficked into sex work.[2]Girls are exploited for sex work, they are either kidnapped or abducted. Sometimes, women are coerced to get into the sex work due to good payment by the customers. Some are also trapped by misrepresentation, they are called to other places for any reputed jobs but later, they are forced into this work. This racquet is so vast which extends from many parts of the country till across the world. Women are even transferred from one country to other country.Even the Constitution of India provides, prohibition of human trafficking as fundamental rights given under article 23. Trafficking of any person would amount to infringement of fundamental right after which, Supreme Court can be approached for the same. As discussed above, there are many crimes against women which exist in the society. These crimes result in worsening the situation of women, women are mentally and physically exploited. Women are sexually harassed, molested, raped. They are nowhere safe; they are even raped by their father and husbands. They are tortured by their in-laws for dowry and even killed. This increase of crime and lack of implementation of laws have created fear in the mind of the women, they think many times before stepping out of their homes, they have to care a lot about their safety, what to wear and what not to wear. And when something wrong happens with women, only women are blamed and not the criminal. In our society, there is need to educate people about things and to change the mentality of the society and victim blaming should be stopped. Then only there can be any solution for these crimes against women.[1]Mukesh &Anr. V. State for N.C.T.

As she was arrested on April 10 and there were widespread concerns raised about the incarceration of Zargar, who is in the 23rd week of her pregnancy, in the overcrowded Tihar prison amid COVID-19.On the behalf of the Delhi Police Solicitor General Tushar Mehta submitted that without going into the facts of the plea as well as without giving consideration to the precedent as the Safoora being released on bail provided she doesn’t indulge in activities she’s being investigated for and therefore, the state has no problem.The Advocate Nithya Ramakrishnan, appearing for Zargar contended that for concerning the doctor regarding her health she might have to go to the Faridabad.A bench of Justice Rajiv Shakhdher granted regular bail to Safoora based on the Centre’s concession on furnishing a personal bond of ₹10k and on the following conditions: She is not supposed to indulge in activities she is being investigated for.She should refrain from hampering the investigation.She has to take the permission of the concerned court before leaving the territory of Delhi.She has to get in touch with the Investigating Officer once in every 15 days through a phone call.The Court clarified that the order should not be “treated as a precedent” in this case or any other case.Justice Shakhdher also highlighted that he had received certain documents in “sealed cover” from the State, which he has not opened or perused. The same will be returned to the office of the Solicitor General, the judge said.Zargar has challenged before Delhi HC the June 4 order of Additional Sessions Judge, Patiala House Courts rejecting her bail application.She has been booked under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act on the allegation that she hatched the criminal conspiracy behind the riots which happened in North East Delhi during February 23-25.The Delhi Police has filed a report in the Court stating that Zargar is ‘disposed towards creating turmoil’, and that she was part of the conspiracy to “destroy, destabilize and disintegrate the Government of India in order to compel to withdraw the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) and the alleged National Register of Citizens”."

    "headline": "ADVERSE POSSESSION: SWORD CUM SHIELDHOW FAR ARE THE LAWS OF ADULTERY JUSTIFIED?Lives of LGBTQ in Corona Times and Call for Their Human RightsWhat is a Public Interest Litigation?",
    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma from Jemtec School of Law, Greater Noida and curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.The concept of adverse possession has been adopted from the common law concept which is nearly about 2000 years old. Historically, the concept of adverse possession relates to land being forcibly taken over or conquered by feudal lords, barons and conquerors of the poor, who could not protect their rights and titles over such land. Though this concept has changed over time, it was mostly prevalent in older times when one country’s ruler used to conquer another country and would simply grab those conquered lands from the original and true owner.The theory of adverse possession is based on the principle that the possessor who improves and maintains the land has more valid claim on the land than the owner who never visits or takes care of it. The possessor needs to satisfy three classic requirements which were laid down by the Privy Council in 1912 in the case of Corea v. Appuhany, which should co-exist at the same time. These requirements are as follows: (i) nec vi (peaceful), (ii) nec clam (open), and (iii) nec precario (continuous).There is no explicit definition of adverse possession, however, the Limitation Act, 1963 provides for the limitation to extinguishment and right to sue in this regard. The Act prescribes the required period of possession, which is 12 years for private land and 30 years for government land. Section 27 of the act exhausts the right of the owner after the limitation period. The rationale behind the statute is not to punish the owner, but to protect the interests of the possessor who has maintained the land for the specified time.Even in countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Australia, etc., the concept of adverse land possession is recognized with different limitation periods for each country.A plea of adverse possession is not a pure question of law but a blended one including questions of the law and facts. Therefore, the claimant has to prove the following clearly and necessarily, as he is trying to defeat the rights of the owner:In the case of Powell v. McFarlene, it was held that “if the law is to attribute possession of land to a person who can establish no paper title to possession, he must be shown to have both factual possession and the requisite intention to possess”.The Supreme Court, in the case of Gurudwara Sahab v. Gram Panchayat Village Sirthala, stated that the plea of adverse possession can only be used as a shield by the defendant and not as a sword by the plaintiff. Therefore, it was made crystal clear that the possessor, though has ripened into ownership by virtue of adverse possession, he can use it as a defense only availing to defendant against plaintiff and not to file a suit seeking for a declaration for his title based on his prescriptive right. The said legal proposition was relied on by the honourable Supreme Court in the cases of State of Uttarakhand v. Mandir Shri Lakshmi Siddh and LRs v. Punjab Wakf Board. In the case of Ravinder Kaur Grewal v. Manjit Kaur, the court over ruled the propositions made in the case of Gurudwara Sahab v. Gram Panchayat Village Sirthala, State of Uttarakhand v. Mandir Shri Lakshmi Siddh Maharaj and LRs v. Punjab Wakf Board, rekindling that the possessor claiming title by the virtue of adverse possession can maintain a suit under Article 65 of Schedule I of Limitation Act, 1963 for declaration of title and for permanent injunction in order to protect his possession. Interpreting Column III of the Act, the Court further stated that the plaintiff who has perfected title on the basis of adverse possession, cannot sue to evict a person or protect his possession. The court opined that once the right, interest or title is acquired, it can be used as a sword by the plaintiff as well as a shield by the defendant within the ken of Article 65 of the said Act. The court reiterated that neither trespassing nor possession is synonymous to adverse possession.The law has been considered extremely draconian to the true owner and a blessing to a dishonest person who has taken property under his possession, and thereby the Court in cases such as Hemaji Waghaji v. Bhikhabhai Khengarbhai Harijan & ors. and State of Harayana v. Mukesh Kumar, has expressed the disapproval of the law several times and opined that the Parliament must seriously concern abolishing at least “bad faith” adverse possession, such as achieved through intentional trespassing. Often circumstances occur due to the law of adverse possession where true owners of immovable property are dispossessed either because of their non-deliberate inactions, deprivation or some other excuse why those true owners are unable to approach the court and take advantage of the legal remedies.As it sends a wrong message to the society, therefore, there were also recommendations from across the legal fraternity spectrum to increase the limitation period to 30 and 50 years instead of merely 12 and 30 years respectively as this will ensure that those who advance such claims of adverse possession are only those who are intimately connected with the land.In the light of the judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, the Law Commission of India prepared a consultation paper cum questionnaire containing 11 questions relating to the adverse possession of immovable property. The questions put in the questionnaire were-whether the law of adverse possession should remain in the statutes or whether it is time to repeal them, should the true owner compensate the trespasser for the improvements he has made to the land, and so on. However, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Ravinder Kaur, has put to rest the concept of the statute being irrational and illogical, which would impose an increased commitment to the property at issue and grant more time to the original owner to make a claim.Whether his possession was open and undisturbed or not;How long has his possession continued;What was the nature of his possession;On what date did he come into possession; andWhether the factum of possession was known to the other party or not."

Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.“No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.”This right is considered the heart of the Constitution, the most organic and progressive provision of our living Constitution; the cornerstone of our laws.Right to Health refers to and signifies the most attainable level of health to which every human being has a right. The Right to Health creates an obligation on the States to ensure that the very right is respected, protected and fulfilled, and is duly entitled to all its citizens under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution.The State of Telangana’s order stated total prohibition on treatment and testing of Covid-19 by private hospital and ICMR approved laboratories. The state submitted that the government hospitals are providing the facilities for free and also that during a medical emergency, the state can put restrictions on the Right to Health under Article 21 of the Constitution of India espoused by ADM Jabalapur v. Shikvant Shukla case. The state further submitted that involvement of the private sectors may increase the spread of the virus.Observations made by the Court:The Hon’ble Telangana High Court in the case of Ganta Jai Kumar v. State of Telangana declared that medical emergency of the COVID-19 pandemic cannot be cited as an excuse to infringe the Right to Health under Article 21 of the Constitution of India and every action of the State which affects the rights of the citizens must be supported by reasons so that the Court can know that there has been application of mind to the issue by the concerned authority. The Court does not find any rationale for compelling the citizens to approach the government run hospitals when such citizens wish and are able to pay for the private hospitals and laboratories. The State should preserve its limited facilities for the poorest of the poor by giving them free of cost testing and treatment. The gaps in the state hospitals have been contributed by the private healthcare sector.The ADM Jabalapur Case has been struck down in the case of Justice K.S Puttaswamy v. Union of India and therefore, the Court noted that no emergency has been declared by the Government under Article 356 of the Constitution though undoubtedly, it is a pandemic and Article 359 of the Constitution of India has been amended in the 44th Amendment Act which says that the President cannot suspend the right to move to the court for infringement of Article 20 and 21 during the time of emergency to seek appropriate reliefs.The bench further declared that the pandemic has exposed the poor medical services in the state with very few government medical centers, doctors and nurses, lack of medicines, poor infrastructure, and in such a situation, casting aspersions on the private sector is not logical. The bench did not find any logic behind the argument of the State that private sectors may increase the spread of the virus as the private sector hospitals and laboratories would take necessary precautions and care to protect their own lives and those of others to prevent spread of the virus.The bench consisting of Justice MS Ramachandra Rao and Justice K Lakshman observed that the said order of Telangana Government is illogical, without legal basis, patently arbitrary and unreasonable especially when the Union Government has emphasized on the participation and support of private health care sectors. The Indian Council for Medical Research (ICMR) has granted private laboratories to test COVID-19 infection.The Court added the famous statement of Lord Atkin in the case Liversidge v. Anderson quoting, “In this country, amid the clash of arms, the laws are not silent. They may be changed, but they speak the same language in war as in peace is very appropriate.”The Court further showing its concern, stated that the State of Telangana has a population of 3.5 crores and with the easing in lockdown guidelines, it is expected that the spread of virus may increase and the few government testing centres and hospitals cannot be expected to deal with the huge surge of infections.This was also manifested in the establishment of the “Arogyasri” scheme in Telangana, which the Court pointed out was a scheme that allowed medical treatment in private institutions, which could later be reimbursed by the State.The bench further raised its concern that the figures shown by the state of COVID-19 are not accurate and the same is being doubted by the Union of India, thereby forcing them to send teams from Ministry of Health, New Delhi to verify the actual situation prevailing in the state.Directions issued by the CourtUltimately, the Court allowed the PIL filed to challenge the complete ban on private hospitals and testing laboratories in Telangana to treat / test COVID-19.It directed as follows:The State cannot compel the citizens to get COVID-19 testing from only government sectors; if people are willing to pay the costs and obtain their blood samples tested in private ICMR approved laboratories or private sector hospitals with the necessary infrastructure, they should be allowed for the same.Citizens and residents of the State of Telangana shall have the right to be tested on a payment basis for COVID-19 in any private laboratory currently approved by the ICMR or to be approved at such rates as may be determined by ICMR or any other competent authority of the Union of India in the future.The order issued by the State Government of Telangana was held to be unconstitutional.Only those private hospitals which are approved by ICMR shall be permitted to treat COVID-19 patients. Private hospitals may seek the said application from ICMR."

    "data": "This article is written by Kashish Goyal, from Mody university of Science and Technology, Rajasthan and curated by Shruti Chaudhary, from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow. There is a nationwide lockdown in the whole country since March due to the pandemic (Covid-19). This crisis has majorly affected the employer and employee. Even at the workplace, workers are facing problems; they have to adopt precautionary measures before going for work due to infection. This pandemic has resulted in affecting the payment of wages to the employee. Many guidelines have been issued by the ministry regarding the salary of the workers but they have not been implemented yet. There is so much confusion about whether the employee will be entitled to a salary or not?It is the duty of every employer to pay wages in exceptional circumstances when the employee is not able to work. But on the other hand, it is also true that due to the crisis, the employer is also the one facing many problems as he has to keep his employees busy at work with his own responsibilities.The Ministry of Home Affairs has issued orders since the lockdown has begun:On 17th March 2020, the Government of India informed all the employers of establishments neither to cut the wages nor to terminate the employees. Many states have followed the guidelines completely. There is another point which was stated i.e. all the employers if they are not able to work at their workplace, will be treated as if they are on their work.One of the important orders issued by the Ministry of Home Affairs came on 29th March 2020, which is issued under the Section 10(2) (l) of Disaster Management Act (states that it is the duty of the Ministry of Home affairs to give directions or guidelines to the government regarding the measures which they have to take to meet the unforeseen disaster). Through this order the government want to ensure that all the employers are making payments to their employee without any deduction. It does not matter whether they work in any industry or any shops.Apart from these orders, there are some general duties which should be properly fulfilled by each employer during any type of disaster and these are:Another order came on 17th May 2020, withdrawing the order dated 29.03.2020 which made it mandatory for all the employers to pay salary and wages. The new order dated 17.05.2020 prescribes that the employer can act according to the employment agreements and can apply the legislation related to labour and employment for any matter includes lay off, retrenchment, employment, wages etc. There was a reason behind for withdrawal of the previous order i.e. many unions, employers, and various companies filed a petition and claimed that the court has to take into consideration the financial condition of the employers also. The petitioner said that if they make payments, it will lead to the closure of many firms which will result in economic crisis. They raised many grounds under Article 19 of the In Indian Constitution i.e. Freedom to carry and occupation or trade or if in case they are forced to pay wages then it might lead to the creation of problems in unions.In one of the Judgements of the Supreme Court in a case named “Executive Committee of Vaish Degree College, Shamli and Ors. V. Lakshmi Nariran & Others, the court justified that, when the situation of the country is unpleasant and adverse and a large number of people are unemployed and the employees are unable to meet their daily expenditure, there should be a policy where the employers have to make payments to protect the right of livelihood of employees.There is a clause of Force majeure under the Indian Contract Act 1872 which states that the company has an obligation to perform its duty towards the employee if the situation of the country is terrible and adverse. It provides that the companies are bound to perform their duties.Furthermore, the guidelines which are issued by the government, if not followed and implemented then the responsible entity may be liable to penal provisions.The Supreme Court issued some directions on 12th June in which they asked the employers and employees to negotiate with each other as the industry needs both workers and employers. Because they are some industries that can bear the financial burden to pay the wages but some are going through the financial crises themselves because of the pandemic. Or if in case they don’t want to settle the dispute they can contact the labour authorities. – Justice Ashok Bhushan, Sanjan Kishan Kaul, and MR Shah.It is thereby concluded that, if the government wants to take appropriate action regarding the payment of wages they need to act upon the conditions and circumstances of both the parties. They can’t put the burden on the employer only. The government has to take such measures which lead to justice for both.If the employer will not pay the salary during this time, all employees will face financial crises. It is the supreme duty of the employer not to terminate the employees and pay the salary without any deductions; otherwise, it will affect the financial condition of the employee.If in case the employee joins the duty because it is impossible to work from home, then it is the duty of the employer to provide the safety measures and essential facilities that are necessary for good health.There are some establishments, where the employee can be granted work from home. Every employer should provide the guidelines for work from home and they will be deemed as on duty.There is one more pandemic that is being faced by the government i.e., infodemics where fake news is shared among the people. It is the duty of the employer to provide authentic information related to employment.Under section 188 of the Indian Penal Code 1860, the offender will be imprisoned for 6 months with a fine of Rs.1000, if the person does not act according to the government restrictions and guidelines.Under section 51 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005, if the guidelines issued by the government are not properly implemented by any person, then he/she will be liable to be imprisoned for 1 year."

    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma from Jemtec School of Law, Greater Noida and curated by Yashasvi Kanodia from NMIMS’ Kirit P. Mehta School of Law, Mumbai.“It is time for India to completely revolutionise its social security system and provide portability to its migrant workers,” said Junaid Ahmad, Country Director, World Bank in a discussion titled COVID-19 & The Future of Work, and facilitated by NITI Aayog Vice Chairman, Amitabh Kant.Over the course of the 65-day lockdown, about 200 migrant workers died in road and rail accidents while on their way home. According to a report published in Hindustan Times newspaper, the demand for work jumped by 181% in May, with 36.1 million households wanting work.Social security is a kind of natural right recognised by a legal right that acknowledges certain fundamental human rights for economically vulnerable people aimed at mitigating their sufferings and giving them a sense of place in society. India needs to revolutionize its social security system in order to respond to the new-age workforce that will arise after the COVID-19 outbreak, that has thrown millions of people out of work in addition to implementing sweeping structural reforms across industries and freeing industries such as start-ups and MSMEs from compliance, experts say. India, being the largest democracy postulates itself to be a welfare state and sadly, it is challenging for the executive to ensure that social security to everyone.The International Labour Organization (ILO) is defined as an adopted notion of social security as it covers all measures providing benefits, whether in cash or in kind, to secure protection. The two main functional dimensions of social security, namely income security and availability of medical care is identified as essential elements of social security by the ILO Income Security Recommendation, 1994 and the Medical Care Recommendation, 1994.Social security is different from the social arrangements as the benefits provided do not have any reciprocal obligation, like represent remuneration for work or other services delivered and it is not based on an individual agreement between the protector and provider, like life insurance contract rather it applies to wider people and has a collective character.Articles 9 and 12 of The International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) recognize the right to social security to everyone and list the necessary steps to be taken by the State Parties to achieve the full realization of this right. India ratified ICESCR convention on April 10, 1979 making it obligatory on the part of India to honour the said convention in its spirit and letter.Article 23 of the Indian Constitution prohibits trafficking and similar forms of forced labour and Article 24 of the Indian Constitution prohibits child labour in factory. The Preamble of the Constitution of India establishes India as a Socialist state. According to the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India, the principle aim of socialism is to eliminate inequality of status, income, standard of living, provide decent life and to secure economic, political and social justice to all its citizens. The said objectives can be achieved by the DPSPs under Part IV of the Constitution such as under Articles 38, 39, 41, 42, 43 and 43-A. Besides these, Entries 21, 22, 23, 24 and 26 of Concurrent List i.e., Schedule VII authorizes the Government to take necessary steps for control and regulations of Commercial monopolies, trade unions, labour disputes, welfare and employment of labour to ensure protection of interest of all citizens of the country. Therefore, the Constitution ensures the citizens a political and civil right somewhat different from Human Rights.In Orissa, Dadan Labour was in vogue which made for extremely bad working conditions for the labours. In the 28th Session of the Labour Minister’s conference, the question of protection and welfare of Dadan Labour was considered which suggested setting up a Compact Committee to dive into the whole question and suggest preventive measures in the system. Thereby, a Compact Committee was constituted in 1977 and recommended that a separate Central Legislation may be enacted as the provisions of the Contract Labour (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970 would not adequately take care of the variety of malpractices. The inter-state Migrant Workmen (Regulation of Employment and Conditions of Service) Bill, 1979 was introduced in the Parliament and the same was passed as an Act in 1979. The Act requires licensing of these migrant labours at the time of joining the employment and prohibits engagement of migrant workers in the job without registration and ensures minimum wages to be paid with certain amenities.The Unorganised Worker’s Social Security Act, 2008 came into force with an objective to provide welfare and social security to the unorganised workers and defines “unorganised sector” under section 2(m).The said Act is being considered as one of the major welfare legislations in India. Rashtriya Swasthya Bima Yojna is a scheme under the Act modelling as an alternative to universal healthcare. The scheme has faced several criticisms due to frauds and allocation of funds.Several state governments, such as Uttar Pradesh and Madhya Pradesh, have proposed registration of migrant workers, a provision that is already in the law, and the Central Government is now planning to modernize the regulation by a new code. The High Courts of Allahabad, Bombay, Karnataka, Gujarat, Madras and Andhra Pradesh have given the lost voice to the migrant workers in this testing so far.The Hon’ble Bombay High Court, while hearing a PIL after the death of 16 tired migrant labourers on a railway track, directed Collector from Marathwada to file a report within two weeks as to what steps could be taken for the migrant labours and asked the state to consider whether the migrant labourers can move their homes. The Hon’ble Karnataka High Court directed the government to pay transportation cost of migrant labourers while the Hon’ble Madras High Court asked the government to produce 400 Tamil workers stuck in Maharashtra and asked the Central Government questions about the measures to be taken. Andhra Pradesh HC stated that “If at this stage this court does not react and pass orders to protect the labourers, it will be failing as a protector and alleviator of suffering”. "

    "data": "This article is written by Anushka Sharma from Delhi Metropolitan Education GGSIPU and curated by Shruti Chaudhary from Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University, Lucknow.The world has experienced various types of pandemics but the current pandemic which the whole world is experiencing is a very novel situation for all the countries. The effect of the pandemic is found everywhere from a superpower to an underdeveloped country leaving no one behind and threatening people from each strata of the society.COVID-19 which was declared a Public Health Emergency of International Concern on 30th of January, 2020 has locked human beings and halted all their outside activities which in turn is impacting the economy among other things.In India, the lockdown was imposed on 25th of March to avoid the infection from spreading.The lockdown has impacted the lives of many and mostly the vulnerable communities who are suffering a lot because of the pandemic. There are people who are already suffering from unemployment and other harsh consequences of the pandemic. The country is already facing an economic recession. The pandemic has brought uncertainty for everyone and everything because nobody knows how to deal with it even after its presence for such a long duration.Among other institutions, judiciary is one of the institutions which has been impacted by this pandemic. The courts have been shut down to avoid large gatherings of people which could risk the spread of the virus but the legal institution has come up with an idea of virtual hearing to deliver justice amidst this pandemic because conflicts between individual and individual/individuals and state will still continue whether the pandemic is in existence or not. Therefore, it is very necessary that the judicial institution is vigilant and active during the pandemic because injustice and other ill practices will continue to exist even during the pandemic or may even thrive.The Apex Court of India has dealt with many cases amidst the pandemic, some of them are The PM CARE and the RTI Act issue, Jammu, and Kashmir internet services issue, among others.Now, let’s discuss about the laws which India has used to deal with situations like these. There are two enactments which the Centre and the States is using to deal with the ongoing pandemic.One is the Epidemic Disease Act of 1897 which is an old colonial enactment which was not in use for a long period of time. This act was introduced to deal with the spread of bubonic plague. The enactment was built in such a way that it can be used only for local pandemics and not global ones like the ongoing current pandemic- COVID-19.The act had very less no. of sections during the bubonic plague but after experiencing the current epidemic the act has been amended to include protection of health workers from act of violence and expansion of Section 2A to include regulation of movement of vehicles and persons. Before this pandemic, the act included or stated only the extension of the act, powers of the Central government, penalties, and protection of the people who acted under the act.The second enactment is the Disaster Management Act of 2005. It is a modern enactment which suggests “prevention and mitigation effects of disaster and for undertaking a holistic, coordinated and prompt response to any disaster situation.”These enactments were built to deal with issues like floods, cyclones, earthquakes and other natural disasters or man-made disasters.The law-makers never anticipated how to deal with this kind of global pandemic which stayed so long and made everyone from government to normal civilians uncertain about the future.The pandemic has brought with it other issues which can be resolved only by a vigorous judicial review. The pandemic has not altered but created new and more challenges for the future. There are a lot of modifications and improvements which our health infrastructure, judiciary and other institutions require to go through to deal with any uncertain problems which may bounce in future."

    "headline": "Will Artificial Intelligence replace Judging?Moot Court Preparation CourseUnderstanding the concept of Quantum of Punishment in Court Martial TrailsDO HAND SANITIZERS REQUIRE A LICENSE TO BE SOLD IN STORES?",
    "data": "This Article is written by RIYA KAUSHIK studying LL.B. in Geeta Institute of Law. Curated by Sahana Arya.Artificial Intelligence is defined as any device which is capable of perceiving its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals. It is a system which has the capability of correctly interpreting the external data, to learn from such data, and to use those learnings to achieve specific goals and tasks trough flexible adaptation.Now, the Artificial Intelligence is blurring in one of the most complex areas of Human activity which is Judging.In Hangzhou, a city in North China, justice delivery system is run by Artificial intelligence. Beijing and Guangzhou quickly followed this. These three Artificial Intelligence courts in China judge the disputes which are related to Online Transactions of goods and services.Now the question is can Artificial Intelligence replace judging?As the artificial Intelligence is progressing day by day, it has the capability to avoid potential pitfalls of human by using its technical potential.“The application of artificial intelligence in the judicial realm can provide judges with splendid resources, but it can’t take the place of judges’ expertise,” said Zhou Qiang, the Head of the Supreme People’s court, who advocates smart systems.The recent technological advancements have proved that it can do much more work then just transferring of data. But can it take better decisions than humans?All the human decisions are affected by their personal biasness and prejudice. While the algorithm will not be affected by any such biasness. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, the decisions can be taken very quickly. The algorithm will present all the data within a few seconds.In India, where the no. of lawyers is so vast but the judges to hear the cases is less, leads to pendency of a lot of cases. With the help of Artificial Intelligence, speedy trial can be made and the pending cases can be resolved very quickly.The Artificial Intelligence system will treat all the Individuals equally and will not see them by their caste, race, sex or community.But another question is that, can Artificial Intelligence can match up to Human Judging?The answer to this is No!Artificial Intelligence can take the decisions only on the bases of the data which is fed into it; if there is any fault in data, then the decision taken will also be wrong.There will be no chance of going to superior authority if the party is not satisfied by the subordinate court’s decision; as the data fed into it will be same and there is no chance of any better recovery of decision.Despite of so many advantages of Artificial Intelligence, this fact can’t be ignored that this too is prepared by a Human, & this can also be affected by the biasness of its inventor. There is also a question which is to be considered that if the decision taken by the system is correct or not, who will be responsible for that; who will check the authenticity of the decisions taken by the system.Cyber Crime is also increasing day by day; and there is a lack of proper cyber security systems in India to avoid these crimes. It is easy to hack a system; the computers through which the decisions are to be taken can also be manipulated by the Men.In the current scenario, when the pandemic of COVID-19 is spreading at great pace, Artificial Intelligence is used by many countries to take it as an aid to judicial proceedings. The hearings done by the courts of India are done through via Electronic Devices.But completely relying on the system can not be fruitful; it puts a question on the authenticity of witnesses and trials. It doesn’t assure the confidentiality of the arguments. The system can also be failed, & in such a scenario all the data will be lost.The day when Technology will become the judge of Good and Bad Human Behaviour and assigns appropriate punishments still lies some way in Future.We can say that Artificial Intelligence can’t be used in place of judges; however, it can be used as an aid to the Judicial system to reduce the burden of the Judiciary. Many a problem can be resolved before it comes to judges with the help of Artificial Intelligence. The forensic of Documents can also be checked with its help.Thus, it will be a great decision to use Artificial Intelligence in the Judicial System instead of replacing Judiciary."

    "headline": "Hate speech is not free speech (in the context of Arnab Goswami matter)Are the degrees of lawyers valid???RESTRICTION OF INTERNET SERVICES IN J&K: IS IT JUSTIFIED?Are Contractual Workers Entitled to Benefits under The Maternity Benefit Act?",
    "data": "This article is written by RIYA KAUSHIK studying LL.B. in Geeta Institute of LawOn 19thMay 2020, Justice D.Y. Chandrachudarisingfrom a two-judge bench of the Supreme court refused bothto quash the proceedingas well as to transfer the investigation to CBI in respect of two different FIRs registered in Maharashtra against Arnab Goswami, the anchor of republic Bharat.The FIRinvoked various penal provisions of IPC relating to hate speechand criminal defamation. The broadcast contains the statements and accusations against Mrs. Sonia Gandhi.The FIR claimed that the speech of Arnab Goswami contained hate speech. Hate speech is penalized under IPC; inwhich by words either spoken or written or by signs or by visible representation or otherwise another party is defamed.Hate Speech- As defined by the Cambridge dictionary: Any public speech that expresses hate or encourages violence towards a person or group based on something such as race, religion, sex, or sexual orientation.In the case of Arnab Ranjan Goswami vs Union of India, Arnab Goswami claimed that he had only raised issues in relation to the tardy investigation of the incident of Palghar, Maharashtra, wherein three individuals were lynched by a mob. But the examination revealed the contrary to it. Instead of focusing only on the context of the facts of the matter, he focused his old debate that the 2 of the victims were SADHUS and because of it they were lynched by the mob.He ignored the third victim. He focused all his arguments to provethat the objective of the crime was communal.Further, Arnab Goswami referred Sonia Gandhi as Antonia Maino several times in his speech and said that Sonia Gandhi has performedon the instructions of Italy. He also contended that Sonia Gandhi would soon send a report to Italy mentioning the no. of Hindus killed in the area where they made their governmentto get appreciation. During his entire speech, he tried to provoke Hindus to raise their voice against thisissue.His speech included both Direct and Implicit hate speech.The direct speech also discussed above is of expressed form eitherwritten or oral. While Implicit hate speech is not just by the words, but the manner in whichthe words are said, and the visuals and graphics used to express them play an important role which is clearly done by Arnab Goswami during the debate. He stressed on the word ‘Hindus’ several times in his speech and posted many communal questions on the top and the bottom of the screen.The supreme court held that Hate speech is not Free speech and Moreover, the freedom of speech given under the article 19(1)(a) ofthe Indian constitution cannot be used as defense in this case.Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian constitution guarantees freedom of speech to all the individuals. It gives freedom to express opinion and ideas without any fear of retaliation, censorship, or legal sanction.Knowing the difference between hate speech or free speechFree speech means the freedom of speech and expression of one’s thought while the hate speech spreads hatred. Saying anything defamatory/slanderousby taking the freedom of speech as defense, do not gives the liberty to say anything which can spread hatred among society.In the Arnab Goswami’s matter, many people contended that he has used his right to free speech, but the words used by him and the way he expressed his ideas were highly aggressive in nature.The purpose of the news channels should be to provide news with the facts which are not based on hypothesis but true events. These news channels are followed by a vast community and can lead toa great impact on publicopinion. The news should be given in a neutral manner which is not leaned towards any particular side, case, party, or community.There is a thin line between free speech and hate speech. Freedom of speech as defense should not be used to spread hatred among the society as it can provoke any community to revolt."

    "headline": "FAKE NEWS IS MORE THREATENING THAN CORONA VIRUS IN CONTEXT OF FREEDOM OF SPEECHRELATIONAL CONTRACT :Time for Legal Recognition in IndiaWho won the Presidential Election? How is a President Elected? What are the qualifications?Sale of Obscene Books",
    "data": "This article is written by “Kashish Goyal from Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan”.As we know that the whole country is going through a pandemic, which is the biggest disaster by now historically. Midst, this people are sharing fake news regarding the virus through WhatsApp and other social media platforms. Indeed, people are already scared of the virus and if the media uses this as for promoting their own business in the context of their fundamental right i.e. Freedom of speech and expression, it would affect the public more than the virus. But people have to understand that fake news could be a bigger threat more than the virus.Before this pandemic also, much fake news has been shared which leads to misconception in minds of the people. Looking at the current situation of the country, recently, it has been stated by the World Health Organisation that the government is handling two pandemics together one is Corona virus and the other one is Infodemic (which means the spread of false information around the whole world). Both the terms have a similar meaning, as it also spread through the contact, and once if it starts, it becomes unstoppable.In one of the recent cases of the Supreme Court, Alakh Alok Srivastava v. Union of India, the court pointed out the issue of infodemics in India. The petition contains the problem of the poor worker who wants to go back to their home. One of the fake news has been shared with the workers that lockdown will remain for more than 3 months, While in march the lockdown was officiated to exist for only 21 days, which resulted in the death of many workers as they started travelling back to their homes. This case resulted in making an order by the government to regulate accurate information during the pandemic.There are many provisions that have already been inserted in the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and Indian Penal Code, 1860. These are:Section 54 of the DMA Act, states that any false alarm is created or any warning is shared during any disaster like Covid-19 by any person, then he will be imprisoned for one year with the fine.Section 505(1) (b) of the Indian Penal Code, which defines that, spreading of mischievous and any false information which results in fear in public, the offender will be punished for six-year maximum imprisonment.One more amendment has been made under Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 by the Information Technology (Intermediaries guidelines) rules which states that if any content is published or shared on social media and it threatens the public health and safety then the intermediaries within 72 hours has to assist the government if they asked about the measure of the trace of the information.There are many countries under which the government has already criminalized the false information which is dangerous to the public and includes China, Indonesia, Russia, South Africa, etc.One recent incident happened in Cambodia, where the police have arrested 17 people for spreading false information about the virus and also it included a teenage girl who spreaded the rumour of the corona virus at her school.The main issue is the fake content which is being spread by the people who already know it is untrue but they want people to assume it as being true. In the context of Freedom of Speech and Expression, as freedom of the press is not an absolute right, hence, fake news violates this right, But According to Article 19 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political which also states that the law shall allow certain restrictions on expression if they are against public peace and order. General prohibitions may be imposed on any law.On the 20th of March, Advisory Board issued to the governments three things, one is A campaign of awareness for the user to not share fake news which creates fear in the mind of the people, secondly, to take immediate action against such fake content, Lastly, keep on the check that the information which is shared about the Corona virus is accurate.As we know, due to the pandemic, many states have announced the Public Health Emergency, it is the duty of the government to provide accurate information about what the government is planning. After all these incidents, the government can think on the Chinese style Censorship, under which the government will direct the media to censor the content which they think would not benefit the public peace.CONCLUSIONIt can be concluded that many measures have already been adopted by the government states but it is,however, not working out. That’s why the provisions which are mentioned above should be strictly followed for securing the public peace. Many of the states have faced this problem for many years but now they are handling it properly. During this pandemic, the government is literally confused about what should be dealt first the Pandemic or Infodemic. According to the Freedom of expression which defines that any individual can express his opinions towards society but it should not be against public peace. While protecting the right at the same time we have to protect the public from fake news which is more dangerous than any right. "

    "headline": "Is it right to present criminalization as a solution to Social Problems?Pan card will become useless if not linked with Aadhaar before March 31stFAIR TRIAL: AN ESSENTIAL OF JUDICIAL SYSTEMSenkumar files contempt plea accusing Nalini Netto for delay in reinstatement",
    "data": "This article has been written by Riya Kaushik , a student of Geeta Institute of Law.Criminalization is the behavior of person who conducts a crime. It is also known as criminology and criminal behavior of a person. According to the definition of Lexico powered by Oxford Dictionary, “The action of turning someone into a criminal by making their activities illegal”. The purpose of criminalization is to take actions against public wrongs.In the past few years, the legislation has made several changes in law, introducing definitions which are more elaborate in their form to define crime, one example of which is the definition of Rape, which has been broadened.But Does it a Solution to Social Problems?There are so many Penal Provisions which are made to criminalize the moral and public wrongs. A lot of amendments have been continuously made in these provisions, & also several additions are also made to make them more extensive. But with the expansion of criminal laws, the crime rate is also increasing.The focus should also be given to this aspect that with the extension of criminalization the variety of crimes and their types are increasing. It’s good that we have several penal laws to punish the wrong doer but this is also a cruel reality that even the threat of punishment is not able to put a check on the expansion of criminalization among society.We have several laws made on the public and moral wrongs, but are they sufficient. Many a law are not precise in nature, and several more which are only written in the acts but they are not implemented at the grassroot level.There are several loopholes in the drafting of these laws which give advantage to the wrong doers to gain from that and save oneself from the penal proceedings. Such as Theft & Mischief, the interpretation of both these is different from a minute point, & the advantage of which is taken by the wrong doers.If a proper definition of Mischief would be given containing all the aspects instead of making other several laws on minute differences; then there will be no chance of escaping from punishment and a check will be made on these activities by imposing threat of punishment.The Excess of laws has led to a position of Over-Criminalization which is topic of discussion nowadays. India can’t afford more laws it is not able to handle the present number of laws. The number of judges to hear the cases are also very less. A lot of cases are still pending and many innocent people are living their life as Under Trial Prisoners, which is a great threat to the current justice system.And at the same place, the social issues have also changed as they were a while ago when these laws were made. Several amendments needed to me made in theses with strict liability to put a check on their increment. The actions should be taken strictly upon those who become a hindrance in the implementation of these laws. The enquiry should be made before the conduction of crime to check the criminalization pace in the society.It is true that many amendments have been made from a past few years in the laws, but there are still some provisions which are more essential & are still in the waiting list to think about.These issues include big social problems like illiteracy, poverty, religious conflicts, juvenile delinquency, unemployment, racism, terrorism etc. these issues are always a topic of great discussion and several debates are also made on these issues but there is no strict provision made on them.The Criminalization is also affected by political factors. The political parties influence people to indulge in unfair practices and to promote riots among the country, to fulfill their own selfish interest.Criminalization should be chosen as last resort. As mahatma Gandhi well said, “Punish the crime, not the criminals.” Mere punishing the criminals would not be a solution to the problem of emerging criminal activities. Focus should be given as ton how to stop emergence of criminal thinking among the people. The Psychology of the criminal minded people needed to be understood and steps should be taken to remove the reasons which led to the occurrence of criminal thing and behavior among the people.The government has made many amendments in the laws related to women, such as definition of Rape is expanded, Triple Talaaq is abolished. But is this a solution to all the problems?For Instance, Triple Talaaq has been declared unconstitutional by the apex court but there are several other forms of Talaaq which are being misused under Muslim law. Just because the voice is raised against the Triple Talaaq, does it give solution to all the problems? The criminalization is done only on those activities which are declared as public and moral wrongs; what about those wrongful activities against whom voice is not raised and are still prevailing in the society.There are several other wrongful activities which are not considered as crime even such as Marital rape. And for those provisions are made or amended are still been wrongfully used.Even after declaration of Triple Talaaq being invalid, still its pronouncement is made. The reason behind is that there are many illiterate people who are not aware of their rights and a few take the advantage of the loopholes of the justice system. They know that even if they pronounce Triple Talaaq, it would not make a big deal as the case will go to court and it will stay pending like several other cases, & they can live their life freely up till the decision is taken, which takes many years to come.The most Important factor which is needed to be introduced is ton, make the laws gender neutral. There are many laws which can only be used by women to claim their right for justice but the men on the same glance are not given any right under the laws. And because of this, many a times women misuse their right against men, which is a big reason of criminalization.There are several penal provisions in our legislation but the situation is still the same and the crime rate is also increasing day by day. This concludes that mere punishing the criminals would not result as a threat to stop it. The criminals are needed to be reform.The Reformative theory should be adopted instead of Punitive Theory. Education should be provided to all to aware them about their rights and even the criminals needed to be educated to reform them. They should be reformed into a better person.Our education system should also include subjects like moral values to teach the young generation what is wrong and what is right.The other social issues such as poverty, un-education, unemployment, poor livelihood etc.; should also be given importance & should also be tried to resolve them, as they are the main reason of Criminalization.To Conclude, we can say that there is no point of making several laws on criminalization if they are not able to put a check on the increasing pace of crime. Instead of making several laws, the laws should be decreased in counting and their definition should be made more precise and accurate in their implementation so as not to give any chance to the wrong doers to escape and to gain advantages from its loopholes. The excess of laws would only lead to over criminalization only. The laws should be made strict and should also be revised. It should be the duty of every citizen to abide by them and the government should review their implementation.Reforms should be made in the criminal Justice system.The social Problems will never be fully solved by criminalization, until and unless the socials issues which leads to the criminal intent among the people are solved.

    "data": "This article has been written by Anushka Sharma, a student of Delhi Metropolitan Education GGSIPU.Internet speed has been restricted in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir for several months. The restrictions were further extended till 11th of May, 2020 after the latest order was issued on 27th of April, 2020. Around three petitions were filed challenging the restriction of internet services. These three petitions were based on the same issue of non-availability of internet services in the lockdown which in leading to hindering of the online education and health services among other essential virtual services. A petition was filed by the Foundation for Media professionals to revoke the restrictions imposed on the availability of internet services in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and the Supreme Court on 11th of May, 2020 refused the restoration of 4G internet services in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. Additionally, it also formed a special committee comprising of Home Secretary, Secretary to Ministry of Communications, Government of India, and Chief Secretary of the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir and this committee would be headed by the Home Secretary.Currently, there is availability of 2G services post-paid customers and verified prepaid services but the question which arises here is how will the Union Territory function without internet services?During the pandemic, the educational institutions are completely dependent on virtual internet platforms for imparting education and the 2G internet services provided to the Union Territory are not sufficient for smooth online lectures and webinars and this, in turn, is hampering the education of the students living there. Most of the activities like webinars, competitions, lectures are taking place virtually and the non-availability of smooth and good internet services are making the students lag behind students of other countries and states. The educational facilities provided to the students are very crucial and therefore should have been addressed by the Apex Court. Although the Apex Court took the submission by the Union Territory to be evidentially true, it essentially faulted and logically failed to equate platforms like DD National and radio telecasting with the mainstream e- learning/ virtual learning methods.The reasons for which the Court withdrew 4G services were rise of terrorist attack, militancy, and brainwash/propagandising in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir by using internet as their medium. The counter-arguments to this stance are that firstly, it can be prevented by restricting internet services to the hotspot areas and secondly, the activities mentioned above can be carried on even with 2G services and other communication means and therefore, there is no way through which denying 4G services can benefit the civilians or protect them, instead it is making life during quarantine difficult for them because internet is the only mechanism through which people can keep themselves majorly occupied.The author believes that by restricting internet services even normal civilians might indulge in ill-practices making the situation worse.Secondly, because of the pandemic the courts are discharging or hearing judgements virtually and non-availability of e-connectivity is making the situation worse because no court in the Union Territory is able to discharge essential judicial functions as there is a lack of smooth internet services.Thirdly, because of lack of internet services it would be difficult to get brief information about the situation around them.Now, if we look closely to this issue it also violates the fundamental rights of the citizens guaranteed under the Constitution of India. The right to education and right to health which come under the right to life and liberty expressed/stated in Article 21 of the Constitution, are getting violated. The order also went against the Supreme Court verdict given in Anuradha Basin case in which the conclusion given was to provide safeguards against the misuse of powers under the Telecom rules.The order also has some unconsidered disputes and the following have been mentioned below:Firstly, the unavailability of smooth internet services promotes or exaggerates the problem existing in the Union Territory as the citizens are denied the proper services to cross-check any information received by them.Secondly, the fundamental rights of citizens are getting hampered and because of this outbreak the citizens are mostly dependent on internet services to avoid getting affected mentally by the fear of the pandemic.Thirdly, almost all the nations in the world practise information warfare and denying services would not solve the problem permanently. Instead of doing this, proper permanent measures should be taken to curb this issue."

The State government may also by the notification can specify that Punjabi will be the second official language used for official purposes.After the amendment in Section 3A –Use of Hindi in High Court and Tribunals The following section states that in any court or tribunal whether it is civil, criminal, revenue, or Rent established by the state government shall do their official work in Hindi. The State government shall provide training for staff within six months from the Commencement of Haryana official language (Amendment) Act 2020. (The words which are stated above “Civil court” or “criminal Court” have the same meanings as inserted in “Code of civil procedure, 1908” and “Code of Criminal procedure, 1973”)By inserting the above provisions, many people seem happy because they can easily understand the context written in Hindi. Some people are well versed in English and some are only comfortable with Hindi language. It becomes easy for them to understand any legal document as earlier they have to hire some officials to read the content which limits their resources to get justice. But Apart from the judicial works, there are many institutions which are affiliated to the government sector; they are also working in both Hindi and English. Many of the students came from rural areas and they do not easily understand English well.Now it is clear that a mixed reaction of people is getting to know about Imposition of Hindi in Haryana Courts. Some are in disfavour and rest are in favour. Below are the effects of this imposition on the general public:As we know, among all the states, Haryana is the one where most of the people belong to social background class. A person who was brought up in the villages of Haryana as a Haryanvi owns a pithy relationship with English. An ordinary person who wants to participate in day to day judicial work cannot go further due to hindrance in language. Some major problems which they are facing with the English language are mentioned below:Those who are fluent in the English language argued that:“Law is based upon the facts and circumstances. Language does not play a vital role in judicial work. Any official work can be done in any of the languages, what matters is FACTS OF THE PARTICULAR PROCEEDINGS”After the amendment, a petition was filed in the Supreme Court, where it was argued that there is an unreasonable classification between the Hindi speaking lawyers and English-speaking lawyers in the lower courts. This petition states that Section. 3-A incorporated under the Haryana Official Language (Amendment) Act 2020 is unconstitutional and arbitrary.The petition was jointly challenged by Advocate Sameer Jain, Sandeep Bajaj, Angad Sandhu, Suwigya Avasthi, and Anand Gupta. They contended that to argue in a court, proficiency is required, and language is just a medium to communicate the proficiency. They also stated that in the state of Haryana, most of the lawyers are not even proficient in Hindi as Haryana is an industrial hub. Not all the lawyers practising in the Courts can argue in Hindi as well. The amendment in the act is also unreasonable under Art. 14 and Art 21 of the Indian Constitution i.e. Right to equality and Right to practice a profession with dignity respectively.It can be concluded that the interest of the general public should be taken as a primary consideration. In Haryana, Hindi is made compulsory as it is in the interest of the general public. Our judicial machinery depends on the lawyers and judges and if they will not be able to interpret the law and work properly, our justice delivery system of the country might fail. Therefore, the interest of the general public is supreme and paramount. The lack of understanding English makes it unable for them to understand the affidavit or any other legal document. Because of this, they have to hire the advocates to whom they have to pay higher fees.Arguments by the opposition lawyers in English during the Court proceedings leads to a difficulty in further proceedings.When the judge gives a judgment, they fail to understand the reasons or arguments which are stated by the judge or the defence lawyer.In many courts where the medium of speaking is English, many of the legal workers face problems as the medium of interaction in their law schools was Hindi and now, they are unable to understand in English.Many lawyers have completed their education from the backward colleges of Haryana, or if in case, a new officer tries to polish his language skills, he has to invest more time to get qualified in the language which leads to delay in his career as well as Court proceedings.Last but not the least, when an individual originating from a Hindi Medium College tries to qualify in the Haryana judiciary Exam, the post-qualification interviews are conducted in English where the chance of rejection increases. Only those people are able to crack the Judicial services selection criteria, who are well educated with the English language.It is genuinely difficult to switch the language suddenly.Our Education system also works in English. The Supreme court and the High Courts conduct their proceedings in English as it is mandatory for the courts which is also guaranteed by the Constitution of India. The question arose that whether the teaching institutions should continue to teach the law students in Hindi or should they change their curriculum to English.It is well known that all books are written originally in English. Therefore, it becomes difficult to translate them in Hindi."

    "headline": "APPLICATION OF STRICT OR ABSOLUTE LIABILITY IN VIZAG GAS TRAGEDYDISCUSSION HOUR: DEMONETIZATIONDECRIMINALISATION OF ECONOMIC OFFENCES: OF CHEQUES AND BALANCESTHE STORY BEHIND THE JUDGEMENT: SC SAYS NONE COMPELLED TO STAND DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM IN A MOVIE",
    "data": "This article has been written by Kashish Goyal, a student of Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan.The principle of Strict and Absolute liability has been applied in many landmark judgments by the Supreme Court.As per the rule of strict liability, when any person is working under the premises with hazardous substances and if in case it escapes and causes damages, the liability for such causation rests upon such person. In fact, permissions allowing such activities often include this principle as a pre-condition. However, there are some exceptions to it being, Act of god, Plaintiff’s own fault, consent of the party etc. There are three essentials for the occurence of liability under this rule i.e. dangerous thing, Non – Natural Use of Land and Escape. In reference to this rule, Rylands v Fletcher, case is the most discussed, Fletcher (plaintiff) leased several underground coal mines from land adjacent to that owned by Ryland’s (defendant). The defendant owned a mill and constructed a reservoir on their land, the reservoir was placed over a disused mine. Water from the reservoir filtered through to the disused mine shafts and then spread to a working mine owned by the claimant causing extensive damage. The defendants were held strictly liable for the damage caused by a non- natural use of land. The case became the ancestral source of the doctrine of STRICT LIABILITY for abnormally dangerous conditions and activities. Liability under Rylands v Fletcher is now regarded as a particular type of nuisance. It is a form of strict liability, in that the defendant may be liable in the absence of any negligent conduct on their part.Concerning the Vizag gas tragedy, midst Nationwide Lockdown due to the outbreak covid-19 pandemic, Industry was partially shut down except the maintenance activities, which were being carried out in the plant as per the predetermined schedule. But on 7th of May, a gas named “styrene” leaked from the plant premises which was owned by the South Korean company LG Polymers India Pvt. Ltd in Gopalapatnam, Vizag. Due to this incident, 11 people were killed and over a 1000 people were sickened. Additionally, it also affected the flora and fauna in that particular area. In furtherance to this incident, on 8th May, an order was passed by NGT (National Green Tribunal) which imposed a penalty of Rs. 50 crore on LG Polymers to compensate the same with the District Magistrate. Several reports have been made to determine the cause of the incident. NGT affirmed that leakage of the gas was at mass level that affected the public environment and health and it clearly attracts the principle of strict liabilityFurther, the Rule of Absolute Liability is applied where any enterprise is engaged in any hazardous activity (as defined under the Public Liability Insurance Act 1991) and due to its operation if it harms the public in the vicinity of such operation, then the enterprise will be strictly and absolutely liable to those who are affected. The principle of absolute liability does not require any cause for action. In, M.C. Mehta vs. Union of India, on 4th and 6th of December, 1985 in Shriram food and Fertilizers, there was severe leakage of oleum gas, causing an advocate working at Tis Hazari court to be dead alongwith severely affecting others. The main issue which was raised was whether these tragedies will follow the principle of strict liabilities or they will fall under the exceptions laid down in Ryland v. Fletcher. The issue was brought into the court through Public Interest litigation, and the Supreme Court promulgated a new principle that will ignore all the exceptions, The Rule of Absolute Liability, i.e. strict liability minus Exceptions. The court held that compensation shall be paid to all those who are affected by such act. Concerning, the Bhopal Gas Tragedy , one of the most devastating cases in history. On December 1982, the disaster was caused by the leakage of Methyl Isocyanate (MIC) with other toxic gases from the plant owned by the Union Carbide India Ltd. This disaster resulted in the death of 3000 persons and along with severely injuring a large number of population. The Supreme Court had applied the same rule as in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India, AIR 1987 i.e. The Rule of Absolute liability. The court justified the application herein as:In one of the cases related to Environment and public Health, Vellore Citizen Welfare Forum v. Union of India, under Article 32 of the Indian Constitution, a PIL was so filed by the forum against the massive discharge of effluent tanneries in Tamil Nadu. The tanneries discharge being the untreated effluent was allowed into the open land and agriculture fields, which was the main source of drinking water for the people. This resulted in sheer contamination of drinking water, followed by the shortage of drinking water for the people. The Court directed all the Tanneries to deposit a sum of Rs. 10,000 as fine in the office of Collector. The Court in this case also emphasized on the constitution of Green Benches in India dealing specifically with matters relating to environment protection and also for speedy and expeditious disposal of environmental cases.It can be concluded that in the present circumstances, the rule of absolute liability shall also be invoked as the employees are subjected to work with Hazardous Substances in an extremely lethal environment. In past, the Supreme Court has also applied the Rule Of Absolute liability in M.C. Mehta v. Union of India,1987 case dealing with similar facts. Henceforth, it is the duty of employer to provide a healthy and safe environment to ensure workers’ well being and thereby ensuring stricter compliance to standards that were meant to safeguard the public at large.If any enterprise or any premises is permitted to carry any hazardous activity for private profits, then the law must presume that such permission is conditional. They have social responsibility to compensate those who are affected by the incident as they should absorb those losses as overhead expenses.The enterprise has also discovered the resources against the hazards and dangers and to provide warning against potential hazards."

    "headline": "Does PM Care Fund come under RTI Act, 2005?Happy Safer Internet Day- Tips to Stay Safe on InternetTAX PAYERSDO’S AND DON’TS WHILE ON AN INTERNSHIP",
    "data": "This article has been written by Anushka Sharma, a student of Delhi Metropolitan Education GGSIPU.Prime Minister’s Citizen Assistance and Relief in Emergency Situations Fund (PM Fund) is a public charitable trust. It was created on March 28, 2020 on account of the global pandemic COVID-19. The main objective of this fund is to deal with any sort of crisis and distress circumstances aiding the affected.According to various reports, the funds collected were around INR 6500 crores within a week of its establishment. The funds have been subjected to outrage by the opposition on the ground of its ignorance of the already existing Prime Minister’s National Relief Fund (PMNRF).There have been at least two PIL petitions claiming for the information regarding the PM Care Fund. Both have been dismissed by the Apex Court of India on the grounds of not regarding it a ‘Public Authority’ under the Right to Information Act,:2005.What do we understand by the term ‘public authority’?Section 2(h) of the Right to Information Act, 2005 states that “public authority” means “any authority or body or institution of self-government established or constituted—(a) by or under the Constitution;(b) by any other law made by Parliament;(c) by any other law made by State Legislature;(d) by notification issued or order made by the appropriate Government,and includes any—(i) body owned, controlled or substantially financed;(ii) non-Government organization substantially financed,directly or indirectly by funds provided by the appropriate Government;”The Prime Minister’s Office (PMO), by quashing PM Care fund status of ‘public authority’, is only trying to deduce that it does not fall under the ambit of the Government.The question which arises here is that if the Government is not controlling the fund, then under whose control does the fund fall? If we look at the title, emblem usage and other things of the fund it signifies to fall under the ambit of the RTI Act, 2005.The Government by denying the claim of it falling under the RTI Act, is trying to create suspense and confidentiality around the subject.As a citizen of the country, it is very important to be aware about the initiatives proposed by the government body. There should be a relationship of transparency between the government of a country and its citizens.A relationship of trust can only be built if the government keeps its citizens informed. The refusal and inability to disclose the information about the PM fund is just creating mistrust and keeping the citizens under deception.The trust has been constituted and run by four cabinet ministers in their ex-officio capacities and the denial of giving it the status of the ‘public authority’ comes as a big blow to transparency and also to the democratic value attached to our country.The first petition was dismissed by the Apex Court on the ground of misconception whereas the second petitioner was intimidated with a fine and was told to withdraw the Public Interest Litigation (PIL) considering it a political strategy and saying it has a “political color” to it.The curtailment of freedom of speech is coming into picture in this case where petitioners are threatened if they try to criticize the policies of the government or try to dig information regarding any of the policies or initiatives the government has come up with.If we look closely to Section 2(h)(d), it clearly states that “public authority” “includes anybody owned, controlled or (emphasis supplied) substantially financed directly or indirectly by the appropriate Government.”If we talk about control, then the fund is under the control of the Government as the Prime Minister is the ex-officio chairman of PM CARES Fund and the ministers of Home Affairs, Defense and Finance are its ex-officio trustees. In addition, they also have a power to nominate three additional trustees. Apart from this, they can even formulate rules/criterions for spending the funds of the trust.Talking about financing, collection of Rs.10,000 crores has been generated by donations largely from the Public Sector Undertakings, Central Ministries and Departments and members of the armed forces, and salaries of civil servants and employees in the judicial services which have been mandatorily donated into the fund.Now the question which arises here is that if the PMO is not considering the PM CARES Fund as a ‘public authority’, then the examination of whether the public authorities at the highest level could elicit the government agencies, public servants to contribute to this fund whose details are sought to be kept non-transparent.The author believes that the victims of Covid-19 have a right to know about the fund as they need it urgently to fight the pandemic which is very deadly in nature. The author also believes that not only the patients but even the non-affected citizens have the right to know about this fund and its usage.The case has been filed by Dr. SS Hooda through Advocate Aditya Hooda which will be taken up by the Supreme Court most likely on June 10, 2020. As stated by the petitioner Dr. SS Hooda who filed a Public Interest Litigation in the backdrop of the reply given by the PM’s Office to an RTI application, that if the website clearly states that people who are involved in the management of the fund are working for good cause or in a pro bono capacity and not having any self/personal interest in the fund then why are they hesitant in disclosing such basic information about the PM CARES Fund?Also, the PM CARES Fund has the logo that uses the State Emblem of the Sarnath Lion Capital of Ashoka which is prohibited as the State Emblem of India( Prohibition of Improper Use) Act, 2005. The Act prohibits the improper use of State Emblem of India for professional and commercial use and for other reasons connected to it. The fund also uses the emblem on avenues where the donations are promoted and thus in violation of Section 3 of the Emblem Act which states that “no person shall use the emblem in any manner which tends to create an impression that it relates to the Government” and therefore, the use of emblem is not justifiable.Concluding, the author believes that the Apex Court should deliver a judgement which is in favor of the citizens as they have the right to know about where the money is actually going and whether or not it is getting utilized properly.

    "headline": "Increase of Domestic Violence Cases against Women during LockdownNeed For Advertising Law in India: The Best Product in the MarketDoes PM Care Fund come under RTI Act, 2005?An Overview of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019",
    "data": "This article has been written by Heena Jalan, a student of School of Law, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar.A little excerpt from the Aljazeera– “Parvati, a 45-year-old cook from Chennai became accustomed to the physical violence of her alcoholic, unemployed husband in the early days of her marriage. Before, she would run through the narrow lanes of the slums taking shelter at her neighbour’s tent to escape the beatings of her husband”. Gradually, the physical violence reduced because of the fact that she used to get money home by working as a cook in different households. The money would placate the alcoholic addictions of her husband, ultimately also lessening physical violence against her. But what now?With the lockdown, Parvati was informed by her employer to “stay at home” until the situation normalizes. This lockdown has given her husband an excuse to perpetrate domestic violence on her. Since no work means no money and no money means no alcohol for her husband. In this situation, women like Parvati have been trapped inside their homes with abusive alcoholic husbands. The National Commission for Women (NCW) has seen a twofold rise in gender-based violence across the country. According to a data until now the Commission has received approximately 587 complaints out of which 239 have been reported to be domestic violence cases against women. Assuredly, the actual number is twice more than this but many women are hesitating to report or make complaints in this lockdown, the reason being that they have nowhere else to go. Atrocities against women do not only limit to domestic violence but also includes rape, attempt to rape, dowry death, and harassment. States that have recorded the highest number of domestic violence cases in India are Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, Haryana, Maharashtra, Punjab, Madhya Pradesh and Delhi. Another reason for unreported cases is that the medium of reporting the cases has also reduced. Before the lockdown, women could make physical visits to the concerned office, postal communications were available, or via phone calls, social media, online registrations, emails. Currently, the mediums have been restricted to social media, emails and online complaint registrations. It is imperative to mention that in our country only one-third of women have access to internet connections and smartphones. Other countries like United States, United Kingdom, Australia, France and Scotland are also witnessing an increase in the domestic violence cases during the lockdown. From February 2020 to March 2020 NCW had reported approximately 396 cases related to an offence related to women. Now, NCW is witnessing an exponential increase in the offences related to women, from March 2020 to April 2020, i.e, approximately 587 cases.It has been revealed that husbands who are on the edge and are undergoing the distress of quarantine, unemployment, financial constrain and shortage of alcohol are perpetrating domestic violence against women. The lockdown has placed the women in a vulnerable position of being a victim and ultimately exposing them to violence and trauma.An NGO – All India Council of Human Rights, Liberties and Social Justice (AICHLS) has filed a Petition in the Delhi High Court wherein they have underlined the cause of the increase of domestic violence incidents during the lockdown. The Petitioner in the Petition seeks for corrective measures to be implemented for safeguarding the rights of the victims.The government has indisputably shown no regard for the destitute in planning and executing the lockdown. The government should have been more proactive in implementing the entire lockdown and it should have foreseen the challenges to be faced due to the lockdown. "

    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma, a student of JIMS Engineering Management Technical Campus, School of Law.The fundamental right of the freedom of press implicit in the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. The Indian Press Commission says that “Democracy can thrive not only under the vigilant eye of the legislature but also under the care and guidance of public opinion and the press is par excellence, the vehicle through which opinion can become articulate.”It is a known fact that journalists face grave dangers and undertake enormous risks in reporting inconvenient facts about powerful lobbies. Moreover, freedom of the press is a constitutionally guaranteed fundamental right (Art. 19) and it is the collective duty of citizens and authorities to uphold the right. The threats are a violation of that very right.A global study conducted by the International Federation of Journalists that surveyed 500 women journalists in 50 countries found that 44% of them had experienced online abuse. More broadly, a study by the International Women’s Media Foundation and International News Safety Institute found that nearly two-thirds of women journalists had experienced some form of intimidation, threats, or abuse in relation to their work. Online violence, physical violence in the field, and sexual harassment at the workplace all combine to make journalism an unsafe work environment for women. One can hardly forget the case of Gauri Lankesh, a journalist known for speaking out boldly against the establishment, who was assassinated in her house in Bengaluru a little over two years ago, after receiving death threats online.Recognizing these concerns in 2017, the United Nations General Assembly issued a resolution on the safety of journalists and the issue of impunity addressing violence, intimidation, and harassment of journalists, especially female journalists, online and offline. The General Assembly called upon states “to create and maintain, in law and in practice, a safe and enabling environment for journalists to perform their work independently and without undue interference.”Concerned by the increased online harassment and trolling on female journalists, the International Federation of Journalists (IFJ) in 2017 initiated the Byteback Campaign to fight against cyberbullying calling for strong action to stop cyber-bullying and online harassment of women journalists.Sandhya Ravishankar approached the city police commissioner on March 14, 2017, with a complaint about the harassment and threats and has since been provided police protection over her reporting of illegal beach sand mining in Tamil Nadu, India and IFJ express serious concern over it. Ravishankar approached the city police commissioner on March 14, 2017, with a complaint about the harassment and threats and has since been provided police protection. Ravishankar has also filed a complaint with the Press Council of India in which she had stated that she had been harassed online with trolls on social media using foul language against me, calling me a ‘corrupt’ journalist, and a ‘fake’ journalist. Her mobile number was published on social media by anonymous trolls and she began receiving a flood of abusive and threatening calls from unknown people.Investigative journalist Rana Ayyub has been subjected to relentless doxing, online abuse, and violent threats including death threats in India. She filed a criminal complaint at the Saket Police Station in New Delhi on April 26, 2018.The IFJ said: “The IFJ is seriously concerned by the online harassment and trolling of investigative journalist Rana Ayyub in India. The incident where fake accounts were used against her shows the level of threats that female journalists face online and the lack of mechanisms to stop such harassment. The IFJ demands immediate action from the authorities to protect her from further harassment, threats and potential attack. The IFJ also urges the social media companies to set in motion concrete measures and mechanisms to ensure such acts are not tolerated.”There are laws implemented by the legislature such as the Indian Penal Code and Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition and Redressal) Act 2005, etc."

    "data": "This article has been written by Lakshay Bansal, a student of the Geeta Institute of Law.IntroductionHuman beings live in a community because of its social nature and this social nature demands one to reside in society. Human Being is the only animal that is capable to communicate by language. With the advancement of science and technology communication techniques also changed and with continuous development, journalism also comes into the picture. India is a democratic country and democracy is based on the idea that every person should have his/her say in the government. Journalism is an art by which one can distribute reports on various events. Journalistic media include print, television, and the internet. Today people want to stay updated with all news and issues in society and journalism has played a great role to share information with them.Journalism and Right to Speech and ExpressionArticle 19(1) (A) of the constitution grants the right to speech and expression. Supreme Court of India has given a wide and expansive interpretation of the Right to Speech and Expression so that one can freely express his thoughts and opinions without any hesitation. Supreme Court also said in the judgment of Maneka Gandhi vs. Union of India that democracy is essentially based on free debate and open discussion. If democracy means the government of the people, for the people and by the people then every citizen must be permitted to participate in a democratic process and also enable one to exercise the rights of making choice, free and general discussion of public matters. Right to Speech and Expression clearly provide us the right to express their own ideas and thoughts but on the other hand it ambit is also restricted by the Supreme CourtJournalism on the other hand plays an important role in shaping the thoughts of the citizens. The fundamental objective of journalism is to serve the people with news, views, and other information on the matters of public interest in the accurate, unbiased, and decent matter. But the objective is twisted where instead of showing correct and useful information, reporters are molding the facts for the personal profits not even realizing how the information is going to impact the viewers. We have a very current example of Arnab Goswami’s who is the editor in chief and the owner of the news channel Republic Bharat. Recently various FIRs has been filed against him stating that the statements used by him in one of his debate on his channel were highly provocative and he made vicious comments against Congress President Sonia Gandhi and communalized the whole Palghar Lynching Incident. Udhav Thackrey also said that the mob lynching incident has no communal angel. Those Hindus who were killed not because of the reason that they are Hindus it was suspected that they were thieves but Arnab Goswami has completely changed the fact and correlated the whole matter with religion. During the hearing of his petition in the Supreme Court, Senior Advocate Kapil Sibal termed the petition as based on “Fake Freedom of Speech”. He also argued that Arnab is trying to ignite the communal violence by putting Hindus against the minority. Later on, when Arnab was attacked by two bikers and The Press Council of India said that Violence is not the answer to bad journalism. Gandhi Ji believed that journalism should be founded on truth and non-violence and should be used as a weapon for social transformation. Journalism has a great impact on society because it has the power to change people’s views and thoughts on any issue. It is the duty of every journalist to see that their speech should not be turned into Dangerous speech which can influence and promote the people for any kind of violence. In a democratic country press and the media is one of the corrective forms but unfortunately today this corrective form has turned into a destructive and corruptive form because of the political interference and because of the TRP circus. The reason behind it is the urge to earn money by hook and crook is tarnishing the very image of journalism and press. "

    "headline": "MARITAL RAPECYBER LAWS IN INDIA: EFFECTIVENESSPOWER BATTLES BETWEEN STATE AND SOCIAL MEDIA GIANTSCOVID-19, PLANETARY HEALTH AND CLIMATE CHANGE!",
    "data": "This article has been written by Pragya Srivastava, a student of Banasthali Vidyapith. The existence of society is very old and complex in nature. This complexity is created by the complicated behaviour of human beings. It is through human behaviour where one interacts in the society and that is how a relationship is formed. The relationship varies in nature, but here the emphasis would be on the conjugal relationship of the wedded couple. The mythology behind the institution of marriage is where the father of the bride would entrust his daughter into the hands of the bridegroom who is noble and physically fit. The institution of marriage is a sacrament somehow in all the religions practised all over India. The reason behind the marriage is to procreate children and this logic becomes the instrument to harm the dignity of women nowadays. This harmful indecent act amounts to marital rape. Marital rape is sexual intercourse with his own wife without her consent. The ancient thoughts of ancestors signify that the husband is superior to his wife and where the wife is bound to work in accordance to his orders. Marital rape is in controversy nowadays with the development and progress in human thoughts and behaviour.In accordance to the legal system Section, 375 has an exception “sexual intercourse or sexual acts by a man with his own, the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape”. The fact is rape whether committed by an unknown or by a husband, difference interpreted here is rape by unknown or without the license of marriage is an offence as the element of Consent is missing the victim is forced but a rape committed by the license is not the commission of the offence because as the girl gives assent to the marriage that becomes the consent to commit any activity throughout the lifetime of marriage. With the progress in society the legal aspect for marital rape should be changed. This exception fails to victimise the woman suffering from such an act. The union between spouses is a bond of love, understanding, trust, care which needs proper approval from both; it cannot be measured with the thirst of lust. It’s difficult to understand as to how in the 21st century a woman could be a property of a man. It could be analysed that the makers of Section 375 created the offence of marital rape as an exception with the view that it would be misused and effect the conjugal relation of a couple but they did not have an inclination that it would become a serious crime with the passage of time.It is still far away to criminalise the offence of marital rape. Modi government shows its concern towards this head of IPC which depicts that why it is hard for people to understand that a brutal rape by a husband is not less than the issue of triple talaq. How can a conjugal relation be effected if there would be no wedlock between the spouses? If so then saying marriage a sacrament would be of no use because the relation might ruin as the base of the marriage is the wedlock which shows that this element is so important which would decide the future of a relation. In a patriarchal society, the facts of marital rape are judged with the eyes that a man is always reasonable and the owner of its property which is denoted for his wife and his wife is a machine to reproduce children. This shows the contaminated thinking of those husbands for which a girl leaves the blanket of protection, dignity of her parents with a view that she would be safe with his dream man. It is not just the act but the thinking of a husband makes him marital rapist where there has to be respected for her own wife and not to rule her as the dictator where she is bound to obey his orders without her will.Certain cases like Nimeshbhai Bharatbhai Desai vs. State (2017)[1] this case dealt with the issue of marital rape but it was held by the Gujarat High court that the husband cannot be punished for raping his wife because the law does not recognise the marital rape he could be made liable for outraging her modesty or for unnatural sex.Independent thought vs. Union of India and another (2017)[2] this case dealt with the fact that that sexual intercourse with a minor wife age between 15 to 18 years is rape but again the no criminalization for an offence committed to a wife above 18 years which comes into the account of marital rape.Marital rape violates Article 14 of the constitution which states right to equality, the supreme law of the land states that no person would be denied equal protection of law but the criminal law deny their protection coverage over the victims who are raped by their own husband. In the case of Budhan Chowdhary vs. State of Bihar[3] and State of West Bengal vs. Anwar Ali Sarkar[4] Supreme court held that the classification made under Article 14 is subject to reasonable test. The exception 2 of penal code does not draw rational nexus of classification so it does not fulfil the requirements of the reasonable test and thus violate article 14 of the Constitution.It also violates Article 21 of the constitution which is the backbone of the constitution states that no one shall be denied of his life and personal liberty except the procedure established by law. The court in recent years has started acknowledging that a woman has the right to abstain itself from sexual intercourse or any kind of sexual activity. It also violates her right to sexual privacy in a matrimonial relationship.The Domestic violence Act, 2005 provides remedies to the victims of marital rape where it is termed as domestic violence against women or cruelty by husband against her wife but not as RAPE.CONCLUSIONPeople need to understand that woman is not a property for anyone she is not the object to show the manhood but to get it into the head that it’s her body and her choice which needs to be respected. Further, the judiciary should take some initiative to remove this discrimination faced by the married woman by sacrificing her dignity.

    "data": " This article has been written by Kashish Goyal, a student of Mody University of Science and Technology, RajasthanRape includes Forced Sexual Intercourse between an adult or a minor, members of the opposite sex or homosexual (includes members of same-sex). It involves the insertion of an erect penis into the female vagina. Sexual intercourse between an adult and a minor is basically known as statutory rape. In India, as there is no legislation on male rape or any sexual act committed by women to men. On the other hand, there is Legislation on female rape which has been constituted under section 375 of Indian Penal Code as “Rape” which includes:The court will decide that the above acts are rape:If it is done without her consent or she agrees because she thinks that the accused person is her husband, in case she is drunk or mentally ill or she is under 18 or in last she is no position to indicate like she is unconscious.As we know, there is no law regarding male rape but male sexual abuse can be divided into abuse against children and abuse against adults.Under the sexual offences act, 2002, it is an offence for any male to penetrate with his penis or mouth of male without their consent. Male rape recognized in law in 1994 but the 2003 legislation made the victim of rape of gender-neutral.This offence is committed where the penetration is by a part of the body (like with finger) for sexual intent.Where any male or female intentionally touches another person without his or her consent.About the gender Neutral Rape, PIL (public interest litigation) was filled in Supreme Court, normally the victims of Sexual Harassment in India are predominantly women and the perpetrators are men. Currently, if a men file a complaint against women for sexual harassment, she will be released free as in IPC a man can only commit rape.There are many instances of sexual harassment faced by men including stalking, sexual assault sexual harassment at the workplace. In all these cases. all women were perpetrators Apart from the laws they also do not receive emotional support, so many of the cases became unreported i.e. because of they may be afraid of being mocked by the co-workers, the fear that female perpetrators may use sexual harassment laws to wrongly implicate the male victim or they may be fear embarrassed if the information of harassment will leak.In some cases, it is also possible that a female perpetrator may resort to sexual harassment laws against the man where he does not give in to her sexual overtures. This happens in case of Akshay Kumar and Priyanka Chopra starrer Aitraaz, where a Raj Malhotra issued by his employer wife for rape when Raj refuses to Sonia sexual demands.In another case of Vijay Nair Sexual Harassment Case, where he faced for a month and started with someone posting a sexually explicit tweet on his twitter profile with a series of sexually explicit messages over Whatsapp and Email. When Nair discovered that it was a woman who Mr Nair was acquainted with. But still, there is no prosecution against women as there is no legal framework in India where women can be prosecuted.It was worth saying that Justice Verma Committee was constituted to recommend laws regarding Gender Neutral Offences in 2013 in India. But this suggestion was not even incorporated in criminal law (amendment) Act, 2013. Like Section 3 of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences which criminalizes “penetrative sexual assault” does not apprehend a female perpetrator. But in the US, namely the regulations of the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission treat sexual Harassment at the workplace as gender-neutral.In next case of James Bond Stuntman Eddie Kidd in the U.K., under this case, a Samantha Kidd, 44 was beating or slapping him in the chest of 54 years old wheelchair-bound star who needs 24-hour care. The court held that wife Samantha Kidd will be jailed for assaulting disabled motorbike stunt rider and calling him a f***** spastic.In the U.K. prior to 1994, one instance happened and that is two friends experienced a similar thing happen to them. They both fell asleep at the party, woke up and they find a stranger having sex with them. But the reactions from others to these events were very different in each case, one friend was taken seriously as a case of rape or other took as a joke. It is because the first friend is women who had woken up to find a man having sex with her, a second friend is a man who had woken up to find a woman having sex with him. Neither friend contacted the police, but a female friend could have pressed charges of rape, on the other hand, a male friend could have pressed charges for sexual assault, but not rape because only a man commits rape in the U.K. In 1994, Man rape only became recognized as a crime in the U.K. In case, if a man had sex with another man without his consent, the crime was buggery, and the maximum penalty was 10 years, as compared with the life imprisonment of rape. But apart from all these Currently in U.K. legislation, only a man can commit rape.Gender-neutral law (which means applicable to both men and women) have found acceptance in 77 countries including Denmark, Australia, Switzerland, the U.S. etc. The 2010 Economic Synovate Survey, 19% of the 527 men surveyed in several metros of the country claimed they had faced sexual harassment and 51% had faced sexual harassment at work. Also, there was a Company for Viacom 18 found in 2013 found that 43% of the male corporate professionals were subjected to sexual advance by the colleagues.According to Indian law, the only form in which a wrong sexual advancement on a man is recognized as an offence is sodomy under Section 377 of the IPC. Apart from that, there is no law to punish a person for molesting a man. As stated above, The centre passed its Criminal Law (Amendment) Ordinance on the recommendation of Justice Verma Committee which substituted the world” “Sexual Assault” for “Rape”.It is concluded that India should think of making laws regarding male violence. In the Indian Penal code, there should be one enactment of this violence. Non – consensual penetration of vagina, anus, mouth in women by a man,Non-consensual touching any part with the mouth. This is not only restricted to sex but beside this forcing a woman to do this with someone is also rape.Abuse against Children: It referred to child sexual abuse. It includes asking or pressurizing the children into sexual activity or physical contact with the child’s genitals.Abuse Against Adults: It further classified into three broad categories:RapeAssault by penetrationSexual assault"

    "headline": "“BOIS LOCKER ROOM”WHETHER MINORS COMMITTING HEINOUS CRIMES SHOULD BE TREATED AS JUVENILE?APPLICATION OF STRICT OR ABSOLUTE LIABILITY IN VIZAG GAS TRAGEDYAadi Shakti Mission",
    "data": "This article has been written by Heena Jalan, a student of School of Law, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar.“Bois Locker Room” or “sadistic masculinity” or a “subtle way of advertising rape culture”? We can connote infinite labels to such criminal act of unsavoury objectification of women and teenagers girls in an enclosed chat room which is otherwise not in the public domain but also on social media involving almost hundred under-aged boys who can also be termed as “juveniles” or just turned adults. This particular information has been ridiculed and has gained mass media attention from all over the world. Throwing some clarity on this, casual sexism, pornography, swapping of nudes without a consensus, sexual remarks, rape fancies, sexual harassment, slut-shaming, and morphing images were some of the illegal doings that were carried out in this so-called “small” chat room. This diabolical incident went viral after a south Delhi girl busted the Bois Locker Room by sharing the screenshots of the group chat on Instagram and Twitter. After investigation, the admin of the group, a boy of 18 years old, was arrested by the cyber cell of the Delhi Police.Even after the #MeToo movement why haven’t we progressed as a society? The reasons pertaining to the unchanging attitude and the prevalence of “gender vengeance” are due to lack of proper sex education in schools, everyday machismo, prejudiced notion, indulging oneself in what absolutism, oblivious parenting, etc. Citing more of such incidents which were widely ridiculed- in 2019 a Mumbai school suspended 8 boys who indulged themselves in slut-shaming and using abhor terms like rape and trash via WhatsApp for their female classmates. Another occurrence that occurred simultaneously with the “Bois Locker room” was the leaking of an apparent sexual assault conversation on Snapchat concerning the rape of a girl, wherein later it was revealed that a girl emulated herself as a boy and planned for her own rape. The netizens deceitfully clubbed these two incidents together and claimed: “Bois Locker Room” to be a bogus construct.Until now, the police has interviewed/questioned many members of the group and have seized many phones and have dispatched the same to the forensics to retrieve the lost/deleted data. The offences perpetrated by the netizens belonging to the “Bois Locker Room” attract penal provisions and amounts to a violation of various laws of India. It constitutes offences under :Section 66E of the Information Technology Act, 2008 which enumerates- Punishment for violation of privacy.–Whoever, intentionally or knowingly captures, publishes or transmits the image of a private area of any person without his or her consent, shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years.Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates- Assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty.—Whoever assaults or uses criminal force to any woman, intending to outrage or knowing it to be likely that he will thereby outrage her modesty, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year but which may extend to five years.Section 354A (1) (IV) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates- Sexual harassment and punishment for sexual harassment. — (1) Aman committing any of the following acts—(iv) Making sexually coloured remarks,shall be guilty of the offence of sexual harassment.Section 354C of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates- Voyeurism.—Any man who watches, or captures the image of a woman engaging in a private act in circumstances where she would usually have the expectation of not being observed either by the perpetrator or by any other person at the behest of the perpetrator or disseminates such image shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which shall not be less than one year, but which may extend to three years.Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates-Defamation.—Whoever, by words either spoken or intended to be read, or by signs or by visible representations, makes or publishes any imputation concerning any person intending to harm, or knowing or having reason to believe that such imputation will harm, the reputation of such person, is said, except in the cases hereinafter excepted, to defame that person.Section 503 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates- Criminal intimidation.—Whoever threatens another with any injury to his person, reputation or property, or to the person or reputation of anyone in whom that person is interested, with intent to cause alarm to that person, or to cause that person to do any act which he is not legally bound to do, or to omit to do any act which that person is legally entitled to do, as the means of avoiding the execution of such threat, commits criminal intimidation.Section 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates- Whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two years.Section 507 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates-Whoever commits the offence of criminal intimidation by an anonymous communication or having taken the precaution to conceal the name or abode of the person from whom the threat comes, shall be punished with imprisonment of two years.Section 509 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860which enumerates-Word, gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman.—Whoever, intending to insult the modesty of any woman, utters any words, makes any sound or gesture, or exhibits any object, intending that such word or sound shall be heard, or that such gesture or object shall be seen, by such woman, or intrudes upon the privacy of such woman, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term of three years.Section 13 of The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012which enumerates– Whoever uses a child in any form of media for the purposes of sexual gratification, which includes-(a) representation of the sexual organs of a child;(c) the indecent or obscene representation of a child,shall be guilty of the offence of using a child for pornographic purposes.Section 15 of The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012which enumerates– Punishment for storage of pornographic material involving child.-(1) Any person, who stores or possesses pornographic material in any form involving a child, but fails to delete or destroy or report the same to the designated authority, as may be prescribed, with an intention to share or transmit child pornography, shall be liable to fine.On 04.05.2020, the Delhi Commission for Women took Suo moto cognizance and issued a notice to the social media platform Instagram and Delhi Cyber Police and mandated to provide specific details of the admin and other group members which include their name, handle name, Email-ID, IP address, location and any other necessary information. But unfortunately, restricted and partial information was tendered by Instagram to the police, which proved to be a major impediment to further continue the investigation. On 05.04.2020, three practising lawyers of Supreme Court wrote a detailed letter and requested the Supreme Court to intervene in pursuance of the timely investigation, inquiry and adjudication of this offence. On 06.04.2020, Advocates Neela Gokhale and Ilam Paridi made a representation of the Delhi High Court to take Suo moto cognizance and register an FIR against the perpetrators and also initiate an investigation on the same. Subsequently, a Petition was filed by Advocate-on-Record Omprakash Parihar and Dushyant Tiwari on behalf of Dev Ashish Dubey, wherein the petitioner prayed to get the Instagram group “Bois Locker Room” issue investigated through SIT or CBI, to arrest all the Instagram Group “Bios Locker Room” members immediately and to provide safety to the girls and women who have exposed this heinous crime of students so that they cannot be harmed by the members of “Bois Locker Room” group.It is horrendous to witness the creation of “Bois Locker Room 2.0” right after the busting of the original group. Instead of being contrite and abysmal, the members of this room threatened girls and pronounced rape threats on them. This conduct of the perpetrator manifests that nothing has changed and nothing ever will. Women will always be a target of male abhorrence, collectively. Presently, it is required by our judiciary to take austere action and not only let alone ensure that justice has been done but to similarly ensure that it is also to be seen. "

    "headline": "ALTERNATIVES OF LITIGATION IN INDIANational Law Institute University-International Academy for Dispute Resolution, International Law School Mediation TournamentBreaking News: SC upholds death sentence for Nirbhaya case convicts4 New Supreme Court Judges Appointed by President of India",
    "data": "This article has been written by Pragya Srivastava, a student of Banasthali Vidyapith.The argument is an art, passion which is developed by our surroundings. It is an appeal towards the reason sprinkled with emotions and intelligence. Arguments are made before a person where one tries to justify its self with this skill. The new trend has now changed this art very minutely where one tries to justify its reason with a cup full of intelligence and manipulation, the art to be known as Litigation. Litigation is an act where a dispute comes before the court and the litigators have to argue in a way that their argument becomes the reason for the act and sprinkles the convincing emotion of the authority. Litigation is the gambling of words where unexpected statements are drawn, but while playing it the victory goes in someone else’s basket which indicates how the litigants give their words on the case by predicting the nature of the case but the judgment goes in the opponent’s basket. Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is an alternate instrument used to resolve various issues of the parties. It is machinery that helps to solve the disputes outside the court with the motive that the issue will not further ruin anyone’s life. ADR can be signified as the spirit of the law which makes justice to live freely and fairly. The mechanism of Alternative Dispute Resolution is an age-old method it has been prevalent in India from the Vedic times. While going deep into the Stone Age the alternative methods it throws light on Bhradarnayaka Upanishad which includes techniques like the Puga, the Sreni, the Kula. These alternative methods sum up to be Panchayats which deals with matters relating to the contract, marriage, criminal, etc. The era of Muslim rule had pieces of alternatives to resolve the disputes which are present in the Hedaya of Islamic Rules. The method progressed in the country when the East India Company came into being. The remains of the regulations made by the British are still in force in Civil Procedure Code 1859.Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) encloses efficient techniques that are helpful to deliver speedy justice to the parties in dispute, it is cheap than the trials in the court. They are extrajudicial in nature. ADR has its roots from the Constitution of India, the expression given by Prof. Dicey claims the Rule of Law which is embodied in Article 14 of the Constitution. The article states that everyone is equal before the law which becomes the Basic Feature of the Constitution; it cannot be destroyed even by the amendments made under Article 368 of the Constitution. Article 14 empowers the man’s right to access justice from a justifiable forum. Article 21 of the Constitution states that “no person shall be deprived of his life and personal liberty except the procedure established by law”. This Article empowers the right to free legal aid with the intention to give speedy trials to the individuals, it had been supported by Article 39A which declares equal justice and legal aid of the Directive Principles Of State Policy.The modes of Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) are:-Arbitration Arbitration is a legal method to resolve a dispute outside the court, wherein the parties in dispute refer to an arbitrator and by whose decision the party agrees. It is helpful in commercial matters. The process involved here is that it is on the party where they opt to have a separate arbitration agreement or there is a term arbitration clause that clearly states the dispute would be resolved by the arbitrator. The arbitrator has to be an unbiased body independent from all such elements where he/she is entitled to resolve a dispute in an impartial manner. The Arbitration in India is governed by The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The cases involved in arbitration are –Guru Nanak Foundation vs. Rattan Singh and SonsIt was held by Justice DA Desai that time-consuming, complicated, and expensive courts have compelled the jurist to have a forum for such cases where the party in dispute gets a speedy trial. Thus, the Arbitration Act 1940 was introduced to govern such cases.Purushottam S/o TulsiramBadwaik vs. Anil &Ors.The bench of justice Arun Mishra and UU Lalit of Supreme Court observed that agreement of Arbitration made after the enforcement of 1996 act and if the case has to be governed by the 1940 Indian Arbitration Act it would be invalid.MediationMediation is a concept to resolve the dispute outside the court where compromise is a major task. The difference between Arbitration and Mediation is the binding of the object, in arbitration the dispute is resolved by some rules and regulation which binds the party but in mediation compromise is drawn between the parties for which they are not bound. Section 30(1) of the arbitration and conciliation act 1996 encourages the party to opt for mediation proceedings. Examples in the Indian legal system for mediation are Gram Panchayat and Nyay Panchayat. A neutral third body is appointed to resolve the dispute between two parties. The case of Babri Masjid is also been driven into mediation.Afcons Infra Ltd vs. M/S CherianVarkey Construction (2010)Supreme Court held that the mediation technique should be used in cases of contract, consumer disputes, and tortious liability as well.B.S Krishnamurthy vs. B.S NagrajIt was held that the process of mediation should be used in family court to resolve the matters of divorce, custody, maintenance, etc. The intention behind it is to settle the matrimonial disputes through a compromise made between the parties.NegotiationNegotiation is a method in which no third party is involved to sort the issues or disputes between the parties. It does not have statutory recognition in India. There are no fixed rules to resolve the dispute. The parties keep before their arguments and issues involved which can also be said as self-counseling. It is a method of redressal in which after negotiating the issue they reach to sign an agreement for their cause of action and solve their issues.Conciliation Conciliation is a method of ADR where an independent third body is appointed as a conciliator to listen to the issues of the parties, to identify the kind of dispute, and the developer options. It is done face to face so that the dispute comes before the party. According to the nature of the dispute sometimes conciliator acts as a messenger and talk to the party separately and like offer them proposals.ConclusionAlternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) is an important method as it delivers justice to the people very fast than the trials in the court. It is cheap and affordable as compared to undergoing the process of litigation. This helps people to speak out their problems without any fear of court. Thus, it should be encouraged ArbitrationMediationConciliationNegotiation"

    "data": "This article has been written by Pragya Srivastava, a student of Banasthali Vidyapith. IntroductionThe history of India regarding the state of Jammu and Kashmir is unforgettable in nature; the brutality involved to conquer the state would remain alive in the memory of both the citizens of India and Pakistan. The history of accession could be blamed but it would be of no use. It could be narrated as a story that when India attained independence in 1947, August 15. Among 565 princely states in India Jammu and Kashmir were one of it. A choice was put up before these states either they can join the dominion of India or of Pakistan or remain independent. The ruler of Jammu and Kashmir Maharaja Hari Singh chose neither to join India nor Pakistan instead he had something else into his mind where he sent a proposal of Standstill Agreement to both the dominions. Pakistan accepted the proposal and sent it back to the state but India acted smartly and refused to accept the offer on the basis that there has to be some discussion made to reach a conclusion thus, the representative on the behalf of the king sent to Delhi. Pakistan accepted the offer on the perception that the state had the majority population of the Muslim community so according to the logic of Mohammad Ali Jinnah it could be conquered and become a part of Pakistan. To implement this they attacked the tribal area of the state so that they could drive out Maharaja Hari Singh from the land of Jammu and Kashmir. It resulted in Poonch Uprising which had the ideology of ‘Azad Kashmir’ this movement was basically against the reign of the king and to demand security for the land. To handle the chaos the kind had the only option to ask help from India. King Maharaja Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession on 26th October 1947 with other princely states which made the land the legal and Constitutional land of India. The action was immediately taken and Indian troops were sent to handle the situation to let the invaders vacate the land. On immediate action, emergency Government was formed in the state which was headed by Sheikh Mohammad Abdullah on 30th October 1947.United nation also played an important role when on 1st January 1948 the issue of Jammu and Kashmir was taken up by the united nation under its charter of Article 35. At the time of discussion, Pakistan refused to agree with the statement that it provided aid for the tribal attacks and on the other hand blamed India for annexing the territory of Jammu and Kashmir. On hearing the representatives of both the countries UN Security Council opened the debate on regarding Jammu and Kashmir on 7th January 1948 to resolve the tension between India and Pakistan. In the meantime, the agreement was temporary in nature which provided special status to Jammu and Kashmir. Hence, the concept of Article 370 and Article 35A was evolved from the Instrument of Accession signed by Maharaja Hari Singh.Article 370 of the Indian Constitution Article 370 throws light on the modifications made for Jammu and Kashmir-Article 370 ensures special status to the state of Jammu and Kashmir. The article imposed several restrictions on the working of the Central government towards the state. The instrument of Accession led the relation between the state of Jammu and Kashmir and India where it had surrendered its defense, external affairs, and communication. This clearly shows the union in India has the power to govern these three subjects of the state.Article 35A of the Indian Constitution This provision was added in the state of Jammu and Kashmir in order to decide the ambit of permanent residents or who all can be called the residents of Jammu and Kashmir. Article 35A gave privileges in other aspects too like the acquisition of the property, public sector jobs, and government scholarship in education, public welfare, and public aid.The history behind Article 35A is that on the advice Jawaharlal Nehru the then cabinet, Rajendra Prasad Incorporated the provision in the Indian Constitution in 1954.Abrogation of Article 370 and Article 35AThe Modi government on Monday 5/08/2019 scraped article 370 and 35A. This step of the Modi government has redrawn the map of the state Jammu & Kashmir. The abrogation of article 370 and 35A ceased the separate constitution of state Jammu & Kashmir. There would be no separate flag for the state of Jammu & Kashmir. Any citizen of India is now permitted to buy or sell the property in the state of Jammu & Kashmir. There will be no separate laws regarding citizenship, Criminal Procedure code will replace Ranbir Penal Code. Further article 356 & 360 would be applicable in the state, the reservation would be provided to the minorities. The state of Jammu & Kashmir would be the Union Territory of India and Ladakh will join it without the legislature.ConclusionThis decision of the Modi government has a more or less equal measure of acceptance and criticism people who accepted had the view that the consideration was temporary so it was for a limited time period. Article 370 gave a separate Constitution which had the imbalance of the fundamental rights or we can say it did not treat people equally. The critics viewed that it has shaken the bridge of the constitution built India and Jammu and Kashmir. Mehbooba Mufti contended that it would be a call of destruction to the State of Jammu and Kashmir after the Pulwama attack. Hence, this a controversial issue that is very sensitive in nature.It would provide a separate constitution for the state. Any change made in the name, boundary, or territory of the state would be with the permission of the state legislature.Part VI of the Indian Constitution which talks about state government will not apply to the state of Jammu and Kashmir.Special status would be given to the residents of the state who are permanently living in there and which would provide employment, government scholarship and acquisition of property.Directive Principles of State Policy and Fundamental duties will not be applied to the state.There would be no right given to the High Courts of the state to issue writs except in the matters of the Fundamental Rights.National Emergency can only be imposed by the union without the interference of the state government. The official language of the state could relate to the official language of the union.Schedule fifth and sixth of the Indian Constitution would not be applicable to the state of the Jammu and Kashmir.President can rule over the state at the time of the Constitutional breakdown of state machinery. Residuary power lasts with the state except in certain cases if there is any terrorist attack, harm to the sovereignty or integrity of India, National Flag, National Anthem etc."

    "data": "This article has been written by Pragya Srivastava, a student of Banasthali Vidyapith.God is creating life each and every second of the timer. It is said that the moment the person leaves the cycle of life one enters the land. God never promises or gives any inclination about the smooth journey of life or it never gives a hint also about how long life would be. One day everyone has to die which everyone knows but they are unknown to the ways that will lead to their death. Today the world is facing the deaths. Corona Virus or Covid-19 has its epicenter in China. It has ruined the happiness of many countries and has now entered India. It is a very dangerous virus which has infected many people all over the world. Who had the inclination that how god will take you back from the challenges of life? This disease has not only hit human society but humanism as well particularly in India. Humanism is not taught it is inbuilt and varies with the experience which life gives. The situation which this pandemic has created is to show courage, intelligence, and humanity. The Government of India both on the central and state level is trying their best to fight back this pandemic, but this needs support. Around January the first case in India came into existence. India is not only the prey of Corona which is the current issue but India has many social challenges like Illiteracy, unemployment, and poverty which is the major problem here and it is getting worst with the current issue of Covid-19. The circumstance is of such a danger that each step has to be taken with a lot of caution and patience. War is fought by the soldiers, they fight with the intention to save their land and people of that very country. Whenever there is a war-like situation the whole country suffers the crisis. The battle is fought by the warriors, soldiers with a lot of courage, intelligence, and patience. Nowadays the warriors of the countries are the doctors the arms for them are the medical products rather than the AK 47 used by the army. Corona has led the Prime Minister of India to take some important steps. Firstly, he announced Janta Curfew on 22nd March 2020, before this step and date many state governments took a lot of measures to prevent this virus but on this date the Prime Minister Of India Mr. Narendra Damodar Modi who addressed India Live by press conference he informed about Janta curfew which meant lockdown people stayed at home that day and further the lockdown was extended by the state governments but people ignored it. This issue as aforesaid that India is not only surrounded by this virus but there are other major problems that India’s faces are Illiteracy, Unemployment, Poverty. Concerned with the act of the people again the Prime Minister of India addressed people and announced lockdown in the whole of India for 21 days and people who will go out and violate the terms and conditions laid they would be held liable under Section 188 and section 279 of IPC 1860. The government of India has also announced some schemes for the people who are poor as everything is closed everywhere except the essential commodities. The situation in India is getting worst in the context of increasing patients. Three days before of completion of 21 days lockdown, the Respected Prime Minister addressed the nation and extended the lockdown to save India and Indians till 3rd May 2020. Law plays a very vital role in the day to day life. It controls our every act in society so that people remain in the discipline. In this crisis of Covid-19 people have lost their senses. They have forgotten the term ‘cooperate’. It can be illustrated that the corona warriors are now the acting god who came on earth to protect people. The Indians are not cooperating with the corona warriors either they are doctors or police officers. They are working day and night to save India against Corona Virus, but these people have been perceived as evil by the people. They are been attacked by the people for whom they are working day and night. The incidents of attack can be seen in Moradabad, Aligarh, Lucknow, Kanpur, Ghaziabad, Howrah, Mumbai, Patiala where Nihangs attacked humanism, etc. These attacks have led both the doctors and police to lose hope and to protest. To prevent the protest and to not break the continuation in the treatment of patients an ordinance was passed and promulgated it under Article 123(1) of the Indian Constitution on Wednesday 22nd April 2020 which stated that violence on health care professionals and other corona warriors would amount to Imprisonment on two categories:- • NORMAL CASES Imprisonment 3months to 5 years Fine Rs 5 Lakh • SERIOUS CASES Imprisonment 6 months to 7 years Fine Rs 1 Lakh to 7 Lakh The ordinance has amended the Epidemic Act, 1897 which also includes the harassment by the landlords to the health care staff and professionals. The amendment has also provided that the offender will be presumed to be a person who committed the offense till the contrary is not proved.To date, there are 31,332 patients in India and it’s the time to support and cooperate as the Government is not thinking of profit now they are just spending money for the people of India. Hence, it is requested to stay at home to cooperate with the government because the situation will get worst if we take it lightly and we should appreciate the steps and measures taken by the government because there is a loss now in every sector. After this circumstance, India will face the outbreak of Crisis but health is important in today’s context. It’s a war between Corona and India which India will win."

    "data": "This article has been written by Lakshay Bansal, a student of the Geeta Institute of Law. Introduction The current condition of the world, millions of institutions are now restricted to work from home because of this they are now dependant on various video-conferencing apps to complete their work. Recently Zoom’s software has emerged as a lifeline for all those who are restricted to work from home. Due to its simplistic user interface and interesting host features, it slowly gained popularity and currently, it has reached 300 Million daily users. But on the other hand with its easy use, it was dangerously exposed to hacking, and because of the security and privacy problems, some organizations shifted to other platforms. The right to privacy is an essential component of the right to life and personal liberty under Article 21. Article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) states that “No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence or to attack upon his honor and reputation. Everyone has the right to protection of the law against such interference or attacks.”The national cybersecurity agency has cautioned against the cyber vulnerability of the popular video conferencing app ‘Zoom’, used by tens of thousands of professionals. Security experts around the world have described the zoom as a privacy disaster and because of this various cases have been filed against the company.Zoom Video Conferencing App violate Right to Privacy in the light of which various petitions is filed in the Supreme Court which includes these pCountries like Taiwan and Germany have also blocked the use of the Zoom app. Taiwan has completely banned the use of zoom because of privacy concerns.

Not only Indian states but the schools of various countries such as Singapore, California Berkeley High School has also decided to suspend the use of the Zoom app raising safety and privacy concerns of the students. Very serious incidents were reported by the schools of Singapore where obscene images were appearing on screens. There are various guidelines which are directed by the various authority regarding the issue. Guidelines framed by NCPR and Home Ministry for its use: Due to this, the doubts have been raised over the use of zoom app, National Commission for the protection of Child Right (NCPR) issues some guidelines to schools for the safety of the children and to protect their identity of the students. The Home Ministry has issued an advisory stating that the use of Zoom is not safe for government officeConclusionWe are the part of society and we live in a world of social media where generally our whole lifestyle is exposed through social media or spy cameras that’s why it is very necessary that privacy should be protected. Sharing the personal information of the people is a violation is privacy but it is claimed by the zoom company that they are handling all the problems in very little time to safeguard the privacy of all individuals. And to tackle all the problems the company has decided to propose a 90-day security plan. Along with that the CEO of the company also started holding weekly public security briefings. They have also hired a number of privacy experts such as ‘Alex Stamos’ who formerly served as a Chief Security Officer at Facebook. So finally they claimed that the zoom has reacted very quickly to the challenges and to eradicate the privacy issues they have proposed a 90-day security plan in which their only goal is to bring more and more positive security updates for the better use of its users.[1]Todd Hurvitz v.

    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma, a student of JIMS Engineering Management Technical Campus, School of Law.Section 188 of Indian Penal Code, 1860 the disobedience of an order promulgated by a public servant lawfully empowered to do so in the public interest punishable. It refers to acts that though prima facie lawful, maybe in particular circumstances show a tendency to endanger the public tranquility by the obstruction, annoyance, or injury, or which cause any such risk to other persons. An order has been duly made and promulgated, although not strictly in accordance with the terms of the law and has been brought to the actual knowledge of the person sought to be affected by it, is sufficient to bring the case under this section.The Ministry of Home Affairs issued lockdown guidelines which state that their violations will lead to an offense under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code.A research conducted by Centre for Accountability and Systematic Change (CASC) shows that between 23rd March 2020 and 13th April 2020, 848 FIRs under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code in 50 police stations in Delhi have been filed. Uttar Pradesh Government’s submission in their twitter handle states that 15,378 FIRs against 48,503 persons under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code has been registered.Former Director-General of Police of Uttar Pradesh filed a petition seeking a writ of certiorari the Supreme Court stating that the registrations of the First Information Reports under section 188 of the Indian Penal code for alleged violations of lockdown guidelines is illegal as it violates Article 14 and 21 of the Indian Constitution. The petitioner submits that as per provisions of Section 195 of Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and various judicial precedents, under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code no FIR can be registered. Cognizance of the offence by the Magistrate can be taken only on the basis of the expressed written “complaint” and not FIR by the officer abiding by Section 195 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. As per Section 2(d) of CrPC, a police report submitted pursuant to an FIR will not come within the meaning of “complaint”.The petition states as that the petitioner himself was the DG(P) of Uttar Pradesh, he understands the police functioning, the pain and suffering of those who are caught. The petitioner expresses his concern that this will lead to an undue burden on police officers as they will have to do voluminous documentation.The petitioner clarifies that there is no means of promoting the violation of the lockdown and states that “Police action on an individual who is perhaps suffering from distress and lack of information as a result of the circumstances has ramifications which can extend beyond the coronavirus lockdown, and cannot be good for constitutional democracy”. He further adds that “the situation needs to be handled humanely and it will be best to avoid adding aspects of criminality, wherever possible.According to the petitioner, when the whole economy is going through India’s biggest emergency, burdening up the criminal justice system with more cases is not going to help anyone.He prays to the Union of India to issue directions under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 to various State governments to refrain from filing FIRs or complaints under Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code for the petty offenses during the lockdown."

    "data": "This article has been written by Heena Jalan, a student of School of Law, KIIT University, Bhubaneswar.The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has caused a multitude of difficulties and disruptions for the Indian citizens who are marooned in different countries of the world. The Government of India undertook evacuation operation of Indian citizens and also citizens of other countries namely, China, US, Japan, Bangladesh, Nepal, Maldives, Myanmar, South Africa, Peru, Iran, Madagascar, Sri Lanka, and Italy when the situation of Covid-19 in India was not daunting and there was no embargo on international travel by the government authorities. The Government of India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare issued press information dated 09.03.2020 wherein the GOI, enumerated the exact number of Indian and non-Indian nationals that have been evacuated through the operation of special flights. These evacuations were carried out with utmost precaution and prevention. The passengers were systematically placed in isolation facilities and camps for 14 days. On 1 February 2020, the first group comprising of 324 Indian citizens were evacuated from the city Wuhan, China who were later quarantined at ITBP Chawla camp and army facility in Manesar. On 3 February 2020, the second group comprising of 330 passengers were evacuated from Wuhan, China. On 26th February 2020, the Indian Air Force evacuated 112 commuters from Hubei, China. Subsequently, on 27 February 2020, the Indian Army evacuated 124 passengers from the Japanese Cruise Ship, Diamond Princess. So far, altogether the Government of India has evacuated 890 individuals from Covid-19 affected hotspots out of which 42 individuals belonged to different nationalities. A Public Interest Litigation (PIL) has been filed in the Supreme Court seeking direction to the central government to collocate special international flights and evacuate the stranded Indian nationals in international jurisdictions. The plea seeks the court to urge the government to perform its constitutional and international legal obligations and duties. The plea further substantiates that the government is indulging in the selective evacuation of individuals and is arbitrarily discriminating against one group of the society. The stranded individuals in other countries are equally entitled to the protection of the government. The Ministry of External Affairs has opined on the same issue that repatriation of individuals from Covid-19 infected countries to India will pose a great threat to the general public. Henceforth, the government has advised the Indian nationals to stay and put wherever they are for the containment of the further outspread of the virus. The ministry has adopted adequate measures to ensure the safety and welfare of the Indian nationals abroad in the following ways such as a cell has been formed in the name of Covid-19 cell in the Ministry of External affairs to tap all the information and to also ensure accurate access of information by the Indian nationals. Further, there are various sub-committees that have been formed to deal with other regions of the world.Nodal officers have been recognized and labeled in different posts to give assistance to stranded Indians. They have been asked to provide helpline numbers and emails that are functional 24*7. In accordance with this, helpline numbers and emails have been widely advertised in social, government portals, and public platforms. Where there are a large number of students stranded, the nodal officers are staying in constant touch with the respective universities and educational institutions to provide aid and assistance. The official Indian ambassadors in different countries are networking with the Indian communities constantly to provide assistance in times of crisis. They are also providing basic food and shelter to the stranded Indian students. On request of the nodal officers, the foreign governments are extending the visas of the Indian citizens.SITUATION IN UK OF INDIANS The UK government is working in cooperation with the Indian government to give aid and assistance to the Indian Nationals. According to a report, there are 400,000 Indian nationals and around 50,000 Indian students. The High Commission is directly communicating with the Indians or through Indian National Student Association UK (INSA UK) or the National Students and Alumni Union UK (NSAU UK). The UK government has issued guidelines for residential educational settings to maneuver a “no eviction policy” for the Indian students that are stranded in the UK. The UK government has also extended the visa which may expire until 31St May 2020. GROUNDS FOR EVACUATION:Due to the embargo on the operation of international airlifts, Indian nationals are stranded in Covid-19 affected regions and are unable to return back to India. This is violating the fundamental rights of the individual included in Part III of the constitution, particularly Article 14 and Article 21 of the Indian Constitution. In light of the unremitting efforts earlier by the Indian government to evacuate individuals from different countries of the world, the Indian government is now violating the right to equality by not repatriating the other Indian nationals marooned, which shall not be looked by the intent of the state action but by its effect. It is violating Article 21, the right to health, an important aspect of Article 21. The blanket embargo has deprived the deserted individuals of essential medical care. The sudden outbreak of this pandemic all over the world has imposed a constructive obligation on the state as “Parens Patriae” to ensure the protection and welfare of its national residing in the country or outside the country in a different territorial jurisdiction. Section 35of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 mandates the Central Government to coordinate with the United Nations agencies, international organizations, and governments of foreign countries for the purpose of the act. It simply means that the duty of the government is not only limited to the territorial boundaries but also extends internationally. Section 36 of the Disaster Management Act, 2005 states that it is the responsibility of every Ministry or Department of the Government of India, clause (g) of the same states that it is their responsibility to make available its resources to the National Executive Committee or a State Executive Committee for the purposes of responding promptly and effectively to any threatening disaster situation or disaster, and sub-clause (iii) providing evacuation, rescue, temporary shelter or other immediate relief.In an open-ended situation of this kind, it is next to impossible to offer evacuation provisions to the Indian nationals marooned in different parts of the world. It is relatively a difficult task since public transportations have also been suspended and it would require a handful of resources for the same. Currently, the Indian medicals are struggling to treat patients that are already infected by a coronavirus in India. If repatriation happens it would burden the medical healthcare system which currently is the last thing that we wish to happen since there is an entirely different issue on the shortage of healthcare workforce in India.

    "data": "This article has been written by Kashish Goyal, a student of Mody University of Science and Technology, RajasthanPrime Minister‘s Assistance Relief fund which was launched on 28 March 2020 to mitigate with the untold disasters like to fight with the current pandemic situations like COVID-19. The setting up of this fund is not only to provide relief to the lives of the people but also to those who are affected by the lockdown. This fund could also be used for other future crises as well. This Fund has been set up as a public charitable trust. The Prime Minister of India is the chairman of this trust and it also includes Home minister Amit Shah, Defence Minister Rajnath Singh, and Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharam as its members. Modi’s PM Care fund is more democratic and constitutional in many ways. Hence, this separate fund makes a perfect sense. As per the legality for the making of this charitable trust, Virag Gupta, a Supreme Court lawyer, said if this fund is registered as per the relevant law i.e. The Registration Act,1948, then there should be no question on the validity of this fund. According to the Public Charitable trust, there are some rules which would be followed, like the opposition party will not be consulted or appointed or given a place on the boards of trustee of the public charitable institution according to the constitution. As per the registration deed, dated 27 March, the fund’s objective includes any relief or any assistance relating to the public health emergency or any kind of emergency or natural disaster, etc. A senior BJP functionary said Congress was objecting to PM Care Fund – The idea is not to make the PM Care Fund political issue. People will be on the board of trustees on the basis of positions in government not on the basis of BJP representation. However, Mohit Choudhary of Kings and allowance a Supreme Court Lawyer said that there are the various number of charitable trust all are not meant for charity if they are not governed by laws and regulations, but he feels that with PM is the chairperson with others members will hardly be an issue for the contribution to the fund. According to section 80(G) Income Tax Act, 1961which states that contribution made to certain relief funds and charitable institutions can be claimed as a deduction. The contribution towards PM Care fund will be an eligible expenditure under Corporate Social Responsibility (Under Corporate Social Responsibility), companies have to spend 2% of the last year’s profit to the social causes as Many corporate houses like Reliance Industries, JSW Steel, etc have contributed to PM Care Fund. There are others who believe that a separate fund made for this disease would encourage more people to contribute because everyone is affected by the Coronavirus Outbreak. Many questions have been put up regarding it that why there is the need for separate funds while there was already a fund existing namely PMNRF which means Prime Minister National Relief Fund? This answer will make you more clear about the validity of PM Care Fund by the statement which shows that in the previous fund, PM had sole discretion to manage this fund, there were no other staff members to assist, unlike the Care fund, here the power is delegated to the other ministers. PMNRF had insufficient balance to deal with this pandemic as this fund is for all kinds of natural disasters and currently, it is especially meant for COVID-19 disease. The government also says that any spending from the Consolidated Fund of India needs to be passed by the parliament. As this fund is attached to the cause. This fund enables micro-donations, as a result, a large number of people will be able to contribute to the smallest number of denominations. For Example, an Earthquake in Andaman or a storm in Orissa is not something for which the people have a concern as that of this disease. This fund will be opened for donations from abroad after the exemption from the foreign Contribution regulation Act,2010. The donor will be able to receive the receipt from the PM Care Fund portal. The money will be transferred to the PMNRF Fund to ensure efficiency and transparency, On Monday, a Plea was filed against the setting up of the PM Care Fund. The Supreme Court dismissed the plea through video conferencing which was headed by Lawyer, M.L Sharma, and by the Chief justice S.A. Bobde. They contended that this fund is not created with the Article 266 and Article 267 of the Constitution which deals with the contingency and Consolidated Fund of India or appeal by the Prime Minister to donate funds in that trust is without any ordinance and gazette notification by the government of India. Article 266 of the Constitution states that all revenues received by the government shall be entitled to the Consolidated Fund of India or any other public money received on the behalf of the government shall be entitled to the public account of India. No money shall be out of the consolidated fund of India except according to the law and manner provided in the Constitution. Article 267 states that Parliament by law establish Contingency Fund which shall be paid from time to time which will be determined by the law and this fund shall be placed at the disposal of the president to enable advances out of this fund for meeting unforeseen expenditure or in case of State, the legislature of the state will determine and this fund will enable the governor of the state to meet the unforeseen expenditure. But it is said that this trust is created with the provision of Article 266 and Article 267. As we know under Article 360, which talks about the financial emergency. Due to this pandemic, the fund is collected from the public to provide relief to those who are affected by Corona. Salary and allowances have been deducted from many pubic authorities. Various Banks, Employees, and Judges are contributing to this fund. So, we can say that our country is in a financial emergency according to the Constitution. "

    "data": "This article has been written by Kashish Goyal, a student of Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan. The Constitution of India provides the fundamental right to life and personal liberty under Article 21. It states that no person will be deprived of his right except the procedure established by law.According to Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, all men are born free and equal in rights. Food, clothing and shelter are not just his biggest concern, but now it concerns about the ritual of cremation. Right to decent burial has been recognised as common law, but still, there is no such universal law into existence.In the context of COVID-19, according to the reports given by the channel named “Puthiya Thalaimurai” had telecasted the news which shows that a 55- year old Dr Simon Hercules was a neurologist, the Managing director of New Hope Hospital in Chennai passed away at Apollo Hospital on Sunday, who had already many health problems, suffered a heart attack and he is suspected that he is contracted with the disease of coronavirus while treatment. After this, his body was taken for cremation to TP Chatram burial ground at Kilpauk, Chennai. As a result, a mob of 40 people reported in the area and refusing for the burial of the doctor on fears that it would spread the virus. After this, the body had to be taken to Velangadu which is three kilometres away but even when JCB machine involved in digging, an angry mob of 70 people gathered from neighbourhood objecting for burial and went to vandalise the ambulance and attacked the officials with stick and stones. Few officials and staff suffered bleeding injuries in the assault. Only after the help of police and after making calls to health ministers body was buried. Such acts were completely unacceptable and legally punishable under Tamil Nadu Private Property Prevention of Damage and Loss Act.On Monday i.e. 20th April 2020, The Madras High Court registered a suo moto PIL over the violent incident of doctor who had served humanity in treating coronavirus patients. The bench of Justices Sathyanarayanan and M Nirmal Kumar issue notice to authorities like State Chief Secretary, Secretaries of Home and Health departments, The DGP and the Commissioners of Greater Chennai Police and Corporation. The High Court Pointed out that “While considering the scope of Article 21, it includes right to have a decent burial. As per the above-alleged acts, a person who practised his profession has been deprived of his right to decent burial in a cemetery observed by the division bench”. It is also asserted that article 21 also entails the right to have a decent burial.The court also gives reference to Section 297 of Indian Penal code, which talks about the punishment for trespass on burial places. Whoever with the intention of wounding the feelings of any person or insulting their religion or offers any indignity to the human corpse or causes disturbance to any person for performing the funeral rites, and further commits trespass in any place will be punished with imprisonment which may extend to one year or with fine or both.The law in India does not expressly state that burial/cremation of the dead is the responsibility of the state, but it is interpreted by court again and again through cases.It was also observed in Kharak Singh v. State of Uttar Pradesh & Ors 1964 SCR (1) 332, the Apex court consider the purview of Article 21 and said that this provision prohibits the mutilation of body and amputation of leg or arm or part of any eye or destruction of any other body organ through which the soul communicates with the outer world. It prohibits any type of deprivation whether it is permanent or temporary.In this case, Francis Coralie Mullin v. Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi, said that right to life is not restricted to a mere animal existence. It includes something more than just physical survival.In the next case, Ashray Adhikar Abhiyan v. Union of India ( AIR 2002 SC 554), The Supreme Court had upheld the right of a homeless deceased to have a decent burial as per the religious belief and the corresponding obligation of the state towards such people.It was observed that Right to dignity under the Article 21 of the Constitution is not only available to the living man but also to his body after his death, the above statement held in this case Pt. Parmanand Katara v. Union of India, 1995(3) SCC (248),The court can also take the guidelines on “Social Stigma associated with COVID-19” that are to be followed in respect of COVID-19 cases. Health ministry, joint secretary, Lav Aggrawal on Tuesday said about the guidelines for the management of bodies infected with the disease. Dead management body is accessible in the public domain. People are expected to be aware of the guidelines from time to time. These guidelines are:In Last, the bench stated that “Citizens are not expected to take law and order into their hands and if it is so then it would definitely lead to anarchy and there would be a similar kind of incidents in future also”. Embalming of the dead body will not be allowed and autopsies should be avoided. However, if an autopsy is unavoidable, stringent infection prevention control practises should be adopted.The large gathering at the cremation or burial ground should be avoided.The health ministry said that the dead body by unzipping the body bag may be allowed for the relatives.The guidelines allow religious rituals such as reading holy books, sprinkling holy water and do not require touching of the body.Bathing, kissing, hugging of the dead body will be prohibited.WHO recommends the Post-mortem examination that packing and transporting a body to burial by ensuring it is fully sealed in a body bag before removed from the isolation to avoid the leakage of body fluid.Union Health Ministry has also advised using personal equipment such as long-sleeved, cuffed gowns for handling bodies."

    "data": "This article has been written by Bhavya Verma, a student of JIMS Engineering Management Technical Campus, School of Law.It was for only a few exhilarating days when social media cooled down its exposing religious fault lines in a sharply polarized country and clapped together but then the Tablighi Jamaat incident happened. Over 2,000, including delegates from Indonesia and Malaysia, had attended the congregation organized by Tablighi Jamaat, a global Islamic missionary movement set up in 1926. While the event took place before India’s nationwide lockdown began on March 25, it violated a Delhi state government order restricting religious and public gatherings, according to chief minister Arvind Kejriwal. Consequently, Kejriwal has asked for a police case to be filed against the mosque administration for negligence. No social distancing would be possible at those places. It may cause grave danger to public health and the objective of containing COVID-19. At present, entry to the Markaz Masjid, the mosque where the congregation was organized, has been banned until further orders.TV channels and media have a major role in turning the public congregation into a communal disharmony. Indian television news flashing headlines like “Save the country from corona Jihad” or “who is the villain of Nizamuddin?”. The news channels have telecasted it as a conspiracy by the Muslim community in spreading the virus and thereby have used the religious sensitive words like Muslims and Jihadis which could be easily replaced by the word “people”. The news channels can be shown telecasting debates amongst people of different religions triggering the religious sentiments of people. The Twitterati has gone way beyond to target, degrade and turn Muslims into enemies of the nation. #Isslamiccoronavirus, #coronajihad, #tablighijamaat, #nizamuddinidiots, etc were some of the trends in Twitter that are against the guidelines issued by The World Health Organization dated 18.03.2020. Islamophobic memes have also been circulating – one meme, for instance, shows China as the “producer” of the virus, and Muslims as its “distributors”. This leads to blaming and asking questions by the Muslim community as well. “It was irresponsible and could have been avoided but there were so many other congregations of other religions which took place. This took place in the middle of Delhi. Why didn’t anyone stop it?” asks historian Rana Safvi in her twitter post. The Twitterati and news channels have divided the “we” to “they” and “us” and gave communal color to the spread of coronavirus. A lawyer from Hyderabad, Khaja Aijaz Uddin has issued notices to Cabinet Secretary, Union Home Secretary, and Police under “Public Interest” seeking direction against Twitter Social Networking Service to stop the publishing tweets. He said that the trending on twitter, also more particularly against the secular fabric of the country as mandated under the Indian Constitution and the trend which is spread on the Twitter social service may result in disturbing the communal harmony of this country. Through Advocate Ejaz Maqbool, Jamaat Ulama I -hind, an organization of Islamic scholars, has moved to Supreme Court seeking strict action against the media for communalisation of the Tablighi Jamaat meeting in Delhi’s Nizamuddin. The plea states that media using communal headlines and bigoted statements to demonize and blame the entire Muslim community threatened their lives infringing their fundamental rights under Article 21 of the Constitution of India. The petition stresses that the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has failed in its duty to give equal protection of law to all persons enshrined under Article 14 of the Constitution of India by allowing the media to present facts in a twisted manner, using phrases that are prejudicial to the Muslim community. The petition urged that the media be directed to tread with caution, be warned against giving any communal angle to the Nizamuddin Markaz incident, and strict action be taken against errant. "

    "headline": "IMPLICATIONS ON THE LAW OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DURING THE PANDEMICJustice Karnan Issue: Former HC Judge CS Karnan get arrested in Coimbatore﻿SEXUAL HARASSMENTDigital Age and Child Pornography",
    "data": "This article is written by Heena Jalan, a student of School of Law, KIIT University.The coronavirus situation has highlighted many concerns for countries all over the world. Since the Pandemic, government bodies from around the world are striving hard to implement appropriate regulations to reduce the corporate and commercial tensions. A global unconventional issue that everyone is motivated at, is the need to relax or suspend the laws of Intellectual Property (IP) to combat this virus. To fight this canker there is an exigent requirement of masks, Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) masks, personal protection equipment (PPE), syringe, gloves, gowns, ventilators, medicines and other medical equipment. Applications for Clinical Trial permission and application to import or manufacture drug/vaccine for sale and distribution would be processed on priority through expedited review/accelerated approval. Any firm having a drug/vaccine already approved for COVID-19 in any other country can directly approach DCG(I) through Public Relations Office regarding expedited review/accelerated marketing in India.As we know, the entire medical industry is comprehensively secured by patent rights. In such times of crisis where the entire world is wrestling and where there is a heavy requirement of medical essentials, there is a lack of manufacturers since all the essentials that are required by the medical industry are patented. Due to this pandemic, the trade industry has also seen a set-back making it difficult for other countries to obtain essential medicines and medical equipment from other countries. In a study it was revealed that approximately, 90% of the pre-drug chemicals which are used to make drugs in the U.S. are imported mainly from India and China in U.S. Currently, the U.S. is facing an acute shortage of the essential equipment and antibiotics. Doctors in different countries are designing 3D prints of CPAP hoods and ventilators due to a shortage of machine parts which might cause the doctors to be dragged in courts for patent infringement. The government needs to be proactive in implementing regulations to either relax or suspend the IP rights for a temporary period since worldwide there is a sturdy shortage of critical medical equipment. The shortfall in local production on account of manpower, import constraints on the supply of essential commodities and the inability of the patent owners to organize mass production of the medical equipment demands for relaxing/suspending/regulating appropriate intellectual property laws. As it allows appropriate businesses to mass-produce essential medical equipment or drugs. This can be monitored by a central authority so that the quality of the goods produced is not an issue. Since fraud in these times are common. In 1998, Michael Kremer, a development economist, proposed a system of “patent buyouts”, according to which the government will temporarily acquire the rights to the invention of great public importance, but only during the critical times or state emergencies. The same could be out in the public domain so that it is feasible for the manufacturers to manufacture the medical devices. By way of an auction, the government can give the contract of manufacturing patented products to potential bidders at their professed values and ensure that patents procured by these bidders are owned and licensed by the government. Grant compulsory licensing of the patented product to other manufacturers, specifically only during this health emergency. Article 73 of the Trade-Related Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS Agreement) was invoked, which states that nothing in the agreement shall construe a member from taking any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests. The application of this exception to manufacture the patented products in the wake of COVID-19 is legally justified. The regulation of a law similar to Title 28 of U.S. Code Section 1498, wherein a manufacturer cannot be held liable for patent infringement when it makes products for the U.S. Instead, the patent owner is restricted to bringing a lawsuit against the government in the U.S. Court of Federal Claims, in all countries. Through a notification X-11026/07/2020-PRO dated 19.03.2020, the Directorate General of Health Services, Central Drug Standard Control Organization has relaxed certain laws to accelerate the treatment of COVID-19 and stated that: The World Health Organization director-general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus proposed a systematic plan to create a voluntary pool of IP rights for patents and data relating to tests, vaccines, and equipment of COVID-19. The same was supported after this was proposed by the Costa Rica Government. It was proposed to provide free access or licensing on realistic and affordable footings for all countries. It also advised other countries, research centers, institutions to open access to their research, data and further also open collaborations so that all countries could take benefit of the science and research. Another scheme that is proposed is the creation of the “Open COVID Pledge”. The Pledge permits anyone to use intellectual property which is otherwise not available to the common public. A model license is available which grants permission to use the IP and technology from December 01, 2019, and the same is effective until one year after WHO declares COVID-19 to have ended.

    "headline": "RIGHTS OF NURSES AGAINST THE DEROGATORY BEHAVIOR OF PATIENTSData Protection and its Importance.ANALYSIS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 2019VACCINE EQUITY – A KEY CHALLENGE",
    "data": "This article has been written by Kashish Goyal, a student of Mody University of Science and Technology, Rajasthan. The Ghaziabad incident took place at MMG district hospital which is one of the fifth centers for those who attended the event at Nizamuddin a place in Delhi between 1st march to 15th march. It was also identified that after attending the event many people were quarantined in different places of the country. It became the hotspot of the Corona Virus. Recently, FIR was filed against the six members of Tablighi Jammat who created problems and misbehaved with the women staff of the hospital, which shows that humanity has lost its existence. At midnight a complaint was filed by the group of nurses to Chief Medical Superintendent (CMS) that the members of Tablighi Jammat were misbehaving with the staff. They were roaming semi-naked before the women staff and at times they stroll nude. They refused to take medicines and also they did not maintain social distancing which is likely to be the only treatment to fight COVID- 19. The members of Tablighi Jammat caused a nuisance by singing obscene songs, making gestures that are vulgar and harmful to the dignity of women. It seems that they wanted to create an atmosphere of fear. With the help of cops, they were placed in a room; otherwise, they were out of control. While complaining this to Senior Superintendent of Police, Commissioner Kalanidhi Nidhnani says that they were asking for cigarettes from the housekeeping staff and making vulgar signs which traumatized the nurses of the hospital. The aftermath of all the acts led the matter to the Delhi Government. Delhi Health Secretary Padmini Singla wrote a letter to Delhi Police Commissioner that the members of Tablighi Jammat were not cooperating. The complaint was filed under the Section 269 of Indian Penal Code 1860,( which deals with whoever unlawfully or negligently deals with the act which he knows that it will likely to spread the disease that is dangerous to life shall be punished with the imprisonment extend to 6 months), Section 270(Whoever malignantly does any act which he knows that it will spread the infection of disease dangerous to life shall be punished with the imprisonment of 2 years with fine, Section 271( Whoever knowingly disobeys the rule promulgate by the government for putting into the state of quarantine or for regulating the intercourse between the places where an infection disease prevail shall be punished with the imprisonment of six months or with fine), Section 294(Whoever did any obscene act in any public place or sings any obscene song shall be punished with imprisonment of three months or with fine), Section 354( Whoever assaults to any women to outrage her modesty shall be punished with term not less than one year but may extend to five year). The acts which took place dealt with the Sexual Harassment of Women and the spread of disease. Later, when the complaint was filed, Uttar Pradesh Government stated that Female Health Staff and Women Police Officials will be no longer engaged in medical service in the Islamic group “Tablighi Jammat” only male officials will work for the Islamic group. Sexual Harassment can be distinguished on two bases:- Firstly, Quid Pro Quo (When women are Sexually Harassed in exchange for work benefits) and Secondly the Hostile Working Environment (Which impose a duty on Employer to provide the women worker a positive environment). There are many cases where the woman is sexually harassed at the workplace: In 2008, Tanushree Dutta, a Bollywood actress was the first one who alleged the case of harassment on the movie set of “Horn OK Please”. The Actor Nana Patekar had indecently touched her on the set of a movie. In the context of the #MeToo Campaign where a woman name those men on twitter or any social media who sexually harass them. On 14 October 2018, The MJ Akbar, Union Minister of External Affairs, has been accused of harassment and sexual abuse at the workplace by the 11 journalists. He was alleged for calling the young female journalist to the hotel room and then harassing them by unwanted touch and gestures. In Case, Mrs. Rupan Deol Bajaj v. Kanwar Pal Singh Gill,( 1996 AIR 309, 1995 SCC (6) 194) The Supreme Court said that this case has changed the meaning of modesty and privacy in such way that any kind of harassment done to women’s private or public life, it will also be considered as an offense. In Vishaka & Others v.State of Rajasthan & Others,(1997) In this case, The Supreme Court laid down the following guidelines, these guidelines are significant because first-time sexual harassment is treated as a separate category of an act called “Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act (Prevention. Prohibition, Redressal), 2013”. These guidelines are followed: It is the duty of every employer to deliver a sense of security to every woman employee. The organization should have a well set up complaint mechanism for the redressal of the complaints made by the victim. It is the duty of the organization to aware of the female employees about their rights by regularly informing them about the new legislation passed. The employer’s duty is to take reasonable steps to provide support to the victim if sexual harassment takes place due to the act of the third party. Issues relating to sexual harassment should be discussed positively in workers meetings. In another case, Medha Kotwal Lele & Ors. V. Union of India & Ors,( (2013) 1 SCC 297) This case helped the Vishakha’s case to implement the above guidelines by issuing notices to all the states. Besides this, after few years of guidelines, legislation has drafted a bill named “The Protection of Women against sexual harassment at workplace, 2007 which emphasizes on harassment within the workplace, but the bill is still pending with the Ministry of Women. There is another relatable Act passed by the legislature “The Indecent Representation of Women Act, 1986 which dealt with if a person harasses someone by showing something which contains indecent representation of women then he will be liable for punishment of minimum 2 years of imprisonment. The Indian Penal Code holds Section 510 which also deals with the uttering words making gestures which outrage the women modesty. "

    "data": "This Article is written by Aditi Chauhan, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth and edited by our content head Shambhavi who is also a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth.An Indian Constitutional jurist, a senior advocate in Supreme Court since 1971, and known as an Indian ‘Legal Legend’. Fali Sam Nariman was born on 10th January 1929, in Rangoon, in a Parsi family, to Sam Bariyamji Nariman and Banoo Nariman. He had completed his schooling from, Bishop Cotton School, Shimla, and then went to St. Xavier College, Mumbai (then Bombay), from where he completed his B.A. (Hons.) in Economics and History. After his graduation his father wanted him to sit in the Indian Civil Service Examination, but as he couldn’t afford it at that time so Fali chose law as his last option as a career and went to Government Law College, Bombay. In 1950, he stands first in the Advocate’s Examination and was awarded by the Kinlock Forbes Gold Medal and Prize for Roman law and Jurisprudence. Nariman started his law career as an advocate in Bombay High Court, where he practiced for 22 years and after that in 1971 was appointed as a senior advocate in the Hon’ble Supreme Court. Fali Sam Nariman had considered his senior’s senior, Jamsetjee Kanga as his mentor and said that he was like the father for him, Jamsetjee Kanga died at the age of 93 but he made him much inspired when at the age of 92 he told him that, he is still learning the law.Nariman played an important role in the development of the Indian Constitutional Law, as he is India’s one of the most eminent constitutional lawyer and has argued many cases related to it. He remained the Additional Solicitor General from May 1972 and resigned from the post on 26th June 1975 at the time of emergency in the country. It happened then in 1999, that President Kocheril Raman Narayan, chose him as the member of the Rajya Sabha and he served for the period of full six years till 2005.If we look upon the timeline of all his works and memberships then since1988 he remained the honorary member of the International Commission of Jurist and member of the London Court of the International Arbitration. In 1989, he has been selected as the Vice Chairman of the Internal Court of the Arbitration of the International Chamber of Commerce and in 1991 he was the President of Bar Association of India. In the year 1994, he served as the President of the International Council for Commercial Arbitration. Not only this, but he was also appointed to the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development in November 1999 and served as the Chairman of the Executive Committee of the International Commission of Jurist from 1995 to 1997. Nariman argued several cases in his career, in many he won and in many he lose, but as the time passes and shows us the reality, then it also makes us realize that how wrong we were in our decisions and makes us regret of them, in the same way, he also regrets his decisions in some of his cases. Nariman fought many major cases like Bhopal Gas Tragedy Case, Golak Nath Case, S P Gupta Case and TMA Pie Case which played an important role in marking the history and landmark decisions in the legal world of the Indian Constitution.The contribution which was made by him in these cases has given a new way of functioning of the Indian Judiciary. The major changes which had been taken in the judiciary were regarding the appointment of judges. He has also written various books on Indian legal and judiciary systems like God Save the Hon’ble Supreme Court, India’s Legal System, Commentary on the Arbitration and Conciliation Act and also written his autobiography Before Memory Fades: An Autobiography.He was been awarded by the Padma Bhushan in 1991, Padma Vibhushan in 2007 and the second-highest civilian award Gruber Prize for Justice in 2002. Also, he has been awarded the 19th Lal Bahadur Shastri National Award for excellence in Public Administration in the year 2018. "

    "headline": "Development of the Concept of Video ConferencingBarbarity against Animal : Judicial ApproachSC directs banks to answer Mallya’s plea for recall of contempt noticeTHE STATUS OF LIVE-IN RELATIONSHIPS IN INDIA",
    "data": "It is rightly said that law must keep pace with the scientific and technological advancements taking place in society. Our Indian criminal justice system requires numerous alterations of the statutory laws to deal with the load on the investigators and judges. One of the crucial changes that require attention is the development of the concept of video conferencing. In Som Prakash vs. the State of Delhi, 1974 Cri. LJ 784, the Supreme Court accurately observed that “in our technological age nothing more primitive can be conceived of than denying discoveries and nothing cruder can retard forensic efficiency than swearing by traditional oral evidence only thereby discouraging the liberal use of scientific aids to prove guilt.” Video conferencing is one of the most useful and strategic products that enable two or more people to connect virtually at the same time belonging from different time zones and at different locations. It has the ability to reduce the workload of the investigators and judges and also acts as an economical solution for the witnesses who are required to travel from different cities and countries to attend court proceedings.In 2003, in a landmark judgment, The State of Maharashtra and P.C. Singh vs. Praful B. Desai and Ors., MANU/SC/0268/2003 Supreme Court categorically gave guidelines to avoid the practical difficulties in recording evidence by video conferencing. Later in Amitabh Bagchi v Ena Bagchi, MANU/WB/0305/2004, Calcutta High Court relied on two judgments, Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation and Ors. vs. NRI Film Production Associates (P) Ltd. MANU/KA/0060/2003 and State of Maharashtra and P.C. Singh vs. Praful B. Desai and Ors., MANU/SC/0268/2003 and pronounced that under Order 18 Rule 4(3) presence does not necessarily mean physical presence. The court also opined that electronic video conferencing is a cost-effective facility and avoids the delay of justice. It is logical that based on persuasive facts and circumstance the courts have used this technology in various cases. In Bodala Murali Krishna v Smt Badola Prathima, MANU/AP/0999/2006. Andhra Pradesh High Court observed that there should not be any plausible objection for adopting the same procedure of video conferencing, in civil cases as long as the necessary facilities, with assured accuracy exists. For a long time, courts have used the facility of video conferencing in plentiful cases initially to curb ad ministerial issues, to save the costs of both the parties and avoid adjournments. Present-day, is the time when the courts can make most from the optimum usage of video conferencing. In the wake of the Corona outbreak in the country, CJI S.A. Bobde proposed to introduce the concept of court proceedings vide video conferencing. This development will be a breakthrough for the Indian courts since there cannot be a complete shutdown of the courts in India. With proper guidelines and assurances, it will be much feasible to put a complete ban on “people to people contact”. Some of the assurances by the Supreme Court E-Committee Chairman Justice DY Chandrachud are:- Now Virtual proceedings, E-filling, and Paperless documents will be a reality!ByHeena Jalan School of Law, KIIT University By introducing video conferring ‘people to people’ contact will reduce. Separate rooms for the counsel for each party will be set up in the Supreme Court premises. The lawyer has to download an application to initiate court proceeding vide a video conferencing which could be conducted in his office. On the commencement of the court, proceeding vide a video conferencing smart televisions will be set up in the press lounge for the journalists. The portal for E-filling will be open 24*7. The court proceedings and procedures will soon go digital. The Supreme Court Advocates on Record Association (SCAORA) will be consulted before the introduction of the virtual rooms and e-fillings. "

    "data": "A data revealed that between the years 2000 to 2015, the Supreme Court had imposed 60 death penalties, where it had erred in giving the death penalty in approximately 15 cases i.e. 25% of the total cases. Can we confide trust and faith in our criminal jurisprudential system to take away the life of a person where it is a recognized datum that the administration of this very system is weak and vulnerable due to reasons being lack of resources, overstressed power of the police and fragile laws? Another argument is that it is not secreted that the court has often failed in discharging its powers due to which in numerous cases the accused has been wrongly imprisoned by the court.In Bachan Singh v. the State of Punjab, (1980) (2 SCC 684), a Constitution Bench articulated the “rarest of rare” threshold stating that “judges should never be bloodthirsty”. Death must only be imposed where the alternative option is indisputably barred. In another world, the death penalty doesn’t deter criminals instead it can be recognized as an inhumane methodology that is used to kill someone which further only continues to propagate the cycle of violence. Furthermore, it outrightly violates the basic right that is provided to everyone under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution: the right to life. Our criminal jurisprudence rests on the very basic foundation of punishing a person for the crimes perpetrated by him against an individual. The concept of “an eye for an eye” is barbaric and brutal. Since 1991, a total of 30 executions have taken place in India, the most recent of which was carried out in 2020. Nevertheless, there is no logical explanation of imposing the death penalty since it has not deterred murder, terrorism or rape in India. Sometimes due to political and media pressure also, the courts are obligated to impose the death penalty arbitrarily making it irrational and unfair. It is crucial to realize that a punishment given by the courts should not imitate the crime. It will be prejudicial from our side to defend the death penalty as it is far more fundamental in nature rather than a mode of seeking vengeance. Implementation of the death penalty has also been very challenging since there are structural defects in our criminal justice system and the biased process of investigation corners the marginalized people ultimately subjecting them to the death penalty. It can be very well reasoned that the convicts on a death row suffer from agony, enervating fear due to the lengthy trials and procedures of the court which is subjecting them to “near torture”. What I propose here is to abolish the death penalty since approximately 140 countries all over the globe have removed it completely from their legal system. Alternately, the degree of the punishment shall be inconsonance with the degree of the crime and criminals perpetrating crimes like terrorism, rape and murder shall be given rigorous life imprisonment without any bail or parole or shall be kept in solitary confinement. India can categorize murder into different degrees like the United States criminal justice system and accordingly the courts can give rigorous life imprisonment whenever required. We live in a progressive civilized society and there should be no room for political vengeance or state revenge. We as a society will be more satisfied when the perpetrators who have committed such heinous crimes are behind the bars for their entire life rather than dying a quick death and gaining unnecessary media attention.

    "headline": "Mr. Harish Salve, A Lawyer Par ExcellenceONLINE LEARNING AND VIOLATION OF ARTICLE 21-A OF THE INDIAN CONSTITUTIONCRIMINALIZATION IS BEING PRESENTED AS A SOLUTION TO SOCIAL PROBLEMSDIGITALIZATION OF COURT PROCEEDINGS: – A NEW WAY TO INDIAN JUDICIARY",
    "data": "This Article is written by Shambhavi, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth working as the Content Director at Legge Rhythms Media and Publications.As a young boy, Harish wanted to be an engineer. By the time he was ready for college, he was deeply interested in chartered accountancy, wanting to follow in his father’s footsteps. Born in Nagpur, he went to SFS School, which was established by the Missionaries of St. Francis de Sales in 1870. After graduating in commerce from Nagpur University, he studied law and chartered accountancy simultaneously. Harish had failed his chartered accountancy exams twice. “Failure teaches you more in life than success does. Dealing with success is easy accepting disappointments with equanimity and harnessing the energy of failure to achieve greater heights are the greatest lessons in life”, Harish says. Harish felt that he must explore and take some risks doing other things. He wanted to start his independent practice. In 1980, he got himself enrolled with the Bar Council of Delhi and decided to move away from accountancy. In 1978, Harish decided to relocate to Delhi to try his luck by setting up his practice at the Supreme Court and joined J.B Dadachandji & Co. as an intern. It was at this time that he got an opportunity to assist Palkhivala in the Minerva Mills Case.Salve’s legal career began when he assisted his father in 1975 in Dilip Kumar’s Case. He followed and represented Dilip Kumar in the Supreme Court. It was a moment of pride, a challenge that Harish confronted with trepidation. It was one of the most “ telling events” of his life when he was made to argue before a five-judge Constitution Bench at the Supreme Court in the important Bearer Bonds Case. This case established him as a lawyer.Harish designated as a senior advocate by the Delhi High Court in 1992. He has been frequently representing large companies like Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Industries Limited in big-ticket cases like the Krishna – Godavari Basin Gas Dispute case against his younger brother Anil Ambani’s Reliance Natural Resources Limited. Harish also defended Keshub Mahindra in the Union Carbide Case when the government filed a curative petition seeking a review of the Apex Court’s verdict dated 13 September 1996 in Bhopal Gas Tragedy Case. By that verdict, the Apex Court had quashed the framing of charges against Mahindra and six other officials of Union Carbide India for committing culpable homicide not amounting to murder, which attracted maximum imprisonment of ten years. Harish was appointed as Amicus Curiae by the Supreme Court in several notable cases including the Environmental and Forest Conservation Cases and Delhi Vehicular Pollution Case. “Amicus Curiae”, in literal terms, means ‘ a friend of the court’. Harish was also appointed the amicus by the Court in another case related to the Gujarat riots.As a young lawyer, Harish learned a great amount from working with Palkhivala. He taught Harish to make excellence an end unto itself. He would often tell Harish, then a budding lawyer, that the measure of how well you’ve argued in court comes not from the decision of the court, but how you personally feel you’ve performed. Like other successful lawyers, Harish also values rigorous preparation and firmly believes that spontaneity is what distinguishes a good counsel from a not-so-good one. He is greatly appreciated and respected in corporate circles as well.Harish took over as the Solicitor General of India (SG) in 1999 during the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) regime. He was only forty-two at the time and held office till 2002. As the SG, he handled several important cases on behalf of the government. The Tamil Nadu Water Dispute Case was an important matter where Karnataka refused to open water channels of the Cauvery river for Tamil Nadu’s use. Harish decided to join London’s Blackstone Chambers to become an English Barrister. He was called to join Gray’s Inn- one of four London Inns of Courts that barristers are required to join before they can practice before courts in England and Wales. He is now engaged with a lot of international work by way of international arbitrations including bilateral treaty obligations. He is at present working on building a practice in the commercial courts.As the second topmost law officer for the Union of India, Harish conducted a large number of important matters like the first anti-dumping case which was argued in the Supreme Court, and the case of privatization of public sector undertakings, the Balco Case. He was also involved in important non-litigation work such as helping in the World Trade Organization negotiations, helping in drafting the electricity reforms, etc.In May 2017, he represented India before the International Court of Justice in the Kulbhushan Jadhav case. Jadhav was sentenced to death by a Pakistani military court on charges of spying. Due to his efforts, the International Court of Justice has ordered a provisional stay on Jadhav’s execution until a final verdict is declared. For this case he charged only ₹1(INR) in legal fees. Harish Salve is simple and modest at heart, but a thorough professional as well – the perfect role model for budding young lawyers. Harish may have climbed heights and received accolades, but there are certain simple things that have made him a prominent figure in the Hall of Legal Fame. Harish Salve is a lawyer par excellence and has been ranked amongst the most powerful persons in the country today. Salve was conferred the Padma Bhushan, the country’s third-highest civilian honor on Republic Day in 2015.He was appointed as Queen’s Counsel for the courts of England and Wales in January 2020. The title of QC is awarded to those who have demonstrated particular skill and expertise in the conduct of advocacy.An ‘activist’ court is no substitute for good government, but at the same time, the judicial arm of social reform can not be a mute spectator to rampant executive apathy and violation of constitutional norms."

    "data": "The ministry of home affairs on 26th March 2020 (Thursday) issued providential guidelines to exempt e-commerce platforms engaged in the delivery of essential goods for the gnawing public after the declaration of 21 days lockdown by the honorable Prime Minister to combat coronavirus pandemic. It is implied that the government is taking all the necessary steps to restrict people from stepping out of their homes. Home Secretary Ajay Kumar Bhalla stated that delivery of all essential goods including food, pharmaceuticals, medical equipment through e-Commerce will remain operational. Due to various reports of e-commerce operations on delivery of essential services getting affected due to indiscriminate police action, the ministry further clarified that all the supply chain of essential goods whether involved in manufacturing, wholesale or retail of essential goods through local stores, large brick and mortar stores or e-commerce companies should be allowed to operate ensuring strict social distancing. The Home Secretary said the restaurants supplying home delivery of cooked food items are exempted.“While warehousing facilities with wholesalers and retailers of essential goods might have non-essential goods, they should not be closed down for the fact that non-essential items are also stored. The retail end of the supply chain shall operate only in essential goods as specified in the orders at the Ministry of Home Affairs. They will provide an undertaking to this effect and also allow a subsequent audit of their records with a view to ensuring compliance,” it said.Ministry of Home Affairs further cautioned on the movement of those employed in the supply chain and said, “Employees or persons engaged in the supply chain shall be allowed to commute on the basis of e-pass or any other certification Issued by the concerned local authority. In addition, the said employee/ person shall carry a valid photo identification card.”For the unorganized sectors and ensuring the supplier’s safety, the ministry stated, that persons engaged in the supply of essential goods may be allowed based on approval and authorization issued by the local authority. It, however, directed the States to carry out regular health and sanitation check-up of employees engaged in the supply chain to ensure that they are provided with proper protective gear with ensuring that they engage only bare minimum staff. The State Government shall open 24×7 control rooms to register complaints and grievances and share these numbers widely. The order said the following constituents of the supply chain should be permitted to function in respect to Standard Operating Procedure (SOP):Following the said orders of the Centre, many companies like Big Bazaar declared their home delivery services providing state-wise phone numbers.

    "data": "What we are witnessing here right now is another criticism towards the Bhartiya Janta Party (BJP). Reasonably, we should be questioning whether an Ex-Judge of High Courts or Supreme Court has a right to accept post-retirement jobs. It is crucial to focus whether at all this post-retirement job of getting elected as a member of the Rajya Sabha is constitutionally acceptable or is it morally ethical? It is unacceptable to outrightly consider it a fallacy that if a Supreme Court judge is being nominated as a member of the Rajya Sabha, the demarcation line between the legislature and Judiciary will fade or get compromised.Since 1950, more than 40 judges have accepted post-retirement jobs either to various Tribunals, Commissions, Governor of a state, The National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Law Commission of India, etc. Some judges desired to take up private jobs like Dipak Mishra, some become politicians like Justice Koka Subba Rao, and some went on to be the governor of a state like Justice Fazl Ali. In pursuance of Article 80 sub-clause (a) of clause (1) of the Constitution of India, read with clause (3) of that article, the President can nominate a person as a member of the Rajya Sabha.The argument that the independence of the judiciary is being compromised by this current nomination goes redundant since it is not the first time that a judge has accepted the assignment of a post-retirement job. The debate on the appointment of Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogi as a Rajya Sabha member can substantially be said to be selective criticism.Potentially speaking, yes pre-retirement judgments do influence post-retirement jobs, but the overwhelming criticism of this extant nomination of Ex-CJI Ranjan Gogi as a Rajya Sabha member is objectionable. As a matter of fact, nothing in the constitution explicitly prohibits an Ex-CJI of the Supreme Court or the High Court to give assent to such positions. Even though such nominations emasculate the judiciary and put a big question on the credibility of the judicial system this nomination cannot be condemned, in its entirety. Condemning such an act of the government is not what is to be done, because the former CJI, Ranjan Gogoi has already taken an oath as a member of the Rajya Sabha.Presently to paralyze such dealings taking place in future, it is required that a constitutional bar, imposing a cooling-off period shall be induced as a law. Further, for a far more stringent law, it is required that a complete bar is imposed on judges to accept post-retirement jobs. Hence, for this, it is also crucial that by way of a bill the age of retirement of such judges be increased from 65 years to 70 years. It is compulsory that we have prudent and reliable judges who resist the enticements of a post-retirement job and this is only possible when we have appropriate laws that govern the kind of job if at all, a judge can take up post his retirement.ByHeena JalanSchool of Law, KIIT University"

    "data": "The Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 has witnessed new amendments of certain provisions that have already been passed by the Rajya Sabha on 12 March 2020 by voice vote. This is the 4th time the new act has seen recommendations that were required to be amended. This amendment is trying to strike a balance between the corporate debtors and the financial creditor. It is aimed to provide immunity and primacy to the corporate debtors who have fallen in the pit of corporate insolvency resolution process or liquidation by a class of financial creditors due to the defaults of the third party wherein meaninglessly they are dragged to the courts.The significant alterations observed are:Firstly, clause (12) of section 5 has been omitted so as to illuminate that the insolvency commencement date is the date of admission of an application for initiating the corporate insolvency resolution process (CIRP).Secondly, under Section 4 the Code required a default of one lakh rupees by the corporate debtor for the initiation of insolvency proceedings by the financial creditors, now under Section 7 this bill stipulates the minimum threshold and requires that allottees under a real estate project to also be installed as financial creditors who can initiate a corporate insolvency resolution process against the corporate debtors but there must not be less than one hundred of such allottees under the same real estate project or not less than ten percent of the total number of such allottees under the same real estate project, whichever is less.Thirdly, Section 11, Explanation II has been inserted wherein the corporate debtor cannot be prevented from initiating corporate insolvency resolution process against another corporate debtor but only under certain conditions which are further clarified, where a corporate debtor is already undergoing CIRP, or has completed CIRP 12 months preceding the date of making of the application or against whom a liquidation order has been made.Fourthly, the makers believed it is mandatory that in order to make the Insolvency process successful the new acquirers shall not be burdened with the legacy issues of the Company acquired. Hence, by inserting Section 32A the liability of a resolution applicant for an offense committed prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process shall cease and the applicant shall not be prosecuted for such an offense from the date the resolution plan has been approved by the Adjudicating Authority only if the resolution plan results in the change in the management or control of the corporate debtor subject to certain conditions. Fifthly, Explanation I has been inserted in Section 14 which states that a license, permit, registration, quota, concession, clearances or a similar grant or right shall not be suspended or terminated on the grounds of insolvency, subject to the condition that there is no default in payment of current dues arising for the use or continuation of the license, permit, registration, quota, concession, clearances or a similar grant or right during the moratorium period. By insertion of clause 2A the Resolution Professional is empowered to continue with the supply of goods and services detrimental to protect and preserve the value of the corporate debtor and it shall also not terminate suspend or interrupt the supply of such goods and services. This will help in keeping intact the credibility of the entire process, it will enhance the value of the company so that other companies are willing to acquire it and will further give the creditors confidence in getting their money back. The government has been quite proactive in facing the dynamic challenges under the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 and it is too soon to judge the efficacies of this particular law which was enacted with a view to consolidate and amend the laws relating to reorganization and insolvency resolution. With the changing times, there will always be a requirement to fill in the critical gaps that are created but what is also required is to have paramount faith in our legislature government and our judiciary.

    "data": "This article is written by Shambhavi, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth.A juvenile court is a tribunal having special authority to pass judgements for crimes that are perpetrated by children or adolescents who have not attained the age of majority. In most contemporary legal systems, children or teens who commit a crime are treated differently from legal adults that have committed the same offence. Juvenile Court is an exceptional court or division of a trial court which deals with under-age defendants who violate any federal, state or municipal law, and any child who is abused, neglected or dependent. Juveniles over which it has jurisdiction are generally under the age of 18, but juvenile court doesn’t have jurisdiction in cases in which minor are charged as adults.In general sense child and juvenile have same meaning but however difference lies in context of insinuation in the eyes of law. Minor implies young and teen persons whereas juvenile either indicates immature person or young offenders.The court has the power to stimulate child custody, support and visitation in some circumstances but permanently cease parental rights or to sanction or require treatment for mentally ill or retarded children.The procedure in Juvenile court is not always contentious, though the minor is entitled to legal representation by the lawyer. It can be striving to involve parents or social workers and probation officers in the process to consummate positive results and save the minor from involvement in further crimes.However, serious crimes and repeated offences can result in sentencing juvenile offenders to prison, with transfer to state prison upon reaching adulthood with limited maximum sentences. Where parental neglect or loss of control is a problem, the juvenile court may seek out foster homes for the juvenile, treating the child as a ward of the court. The juvenile justice system is the structure of the criminal legal system that deals with crimes committed by minors, usually between the age of 10 and 18 years. The upper age of eligibility is determined by the juvenile law of each state, which oscillate. There are some status offences that may be committed by a juvenile, such as curfew violations, running away, truancy and underage alcohol consumption.In the juvenile justice system, youth offenders are not tried as adults, and their cases are heard in a separate court designed for juveniles.Juveniles are imparted many of the same safeguards provided in adult criminal trials, including the right to trial, the right against self- incrimination, and the right to call witnesses. In most states, however, juveniles tried in juvenile court are not entitled to a jury. In addition, juveniles in the juvenile justice system may not avoid detention by posting bail.The privacy of juvenile offenders is strictly guarded. Most of the juvenile court proceedings are closed to the public and these juvenile records are highly confidential.The Ministry of Women and child development began contemplating several preferred amendments in 2011 but the Delhi Gang Rape case in December 2012 had prodigious reverberations on public perception of the Act.One of the accused in Delhi Gang Rape was a few months younger that 18 years of age. He was tried in juvenile court which was criticised by the victim’s mother and said that by not punishing the juvenile the court was invigorating other teenagers to commit similar crime.In August, 2014, the bill was introduced in the Parliament by Maneka Gandhi. And on 25th August, 2015, the cabinet cleared the final version of the bill after some major changes. And this bill will allow minors in the age group of 16 to 18 to be tried as adults if they commit abhorrent crime. The nature of crime will be examined by the Juvenile Justice Board to ascertain if the crime was committed as a ‘child’ or an ‘adult’. This bill also introduced foster care in India.In 2015, Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Act has been passed by Parliament of India amidst intense contention on its various provisions.The Juvenile Justice Act is an act to consolidate and amend the law relating to children alleged and found to be in conflict with law and children in need of care and protection , development and treatment, social re-integration by sanctioning a child-friendly approach in the adjudication and disposal of matters in the best interest of children and for their rehabilitation through process provided and institution and bodies entrenched.There were various provisions added in this Act but some of the provisions were deprecated at high level. The introduction of Judicial Waiver System which allows treatment of juveniles in certain conditions, in the adult criminal justice system and to chasten them as adults. This act was also criticized for prescribing an opaque age determination system and its poor drafting.As of 2019, Ministry of Women &Child Development of Government of India is working towards bringing an amendment, primarily to remove courts from adoption process, to handover it to Executive Magistrate/ District Magistrates and to make Child Welfare Committees administratively and judicially subordinate to District Magistrate, despite nationwide protest against such move.The increasing rates of juvenile crime in India in very scrutinizing issue and need to be fixated upon. Although government has laid numerous legislation and rules to stop the incidents of juvenile crimes but the present laws on juveniles is not fabricating a deterrent effect on the juveniles and thus the results are not fructiferous and legislative intent is not accomplishing."

    "data": "This article is written by Shambhavi, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth.Public Interest Litigation or PIL, is a term that was adopted during the era of 1960s social turmoil in the United States. In India, the term Public Interest Litigation was instituted in 1986 by then Chief Justice P.N Bhagwati. He introduced the term to the Indian Judicial System. The main scheme behind adopting this idea was to give the disadvantaged and marginalized citizens ingress to justice. During the era of 1990s, this concept had transmuted the legal landscape all over the country. It is not a very old concept in the Indian Judicial System. The main motive of introducing the concept was to transform society and paves the way or means of social injustices.Public Interest Litigation is a common concern among citizens in the arrangement and affairs of local, state, and national governments. The term Public Interest litigation mainly refers to a legal action inaugurated in a court for the enforcement of general interest in which public or particular class of the community has pecuniary interest or some interest by which their legal rights or liabilities are affected. In historical times, only those are permitted to move to Supreme Court whose fundamental right being infringed. The participation of the local people can be assured in judicial review of administrative action by this concept of Public Interest Litigation. It plays a vital role in preservice of the rule of law and ensure the accountability and transparency within the structures of governance.PIL is a highly convincing weapon in the armoury of law for reaching social justice to the common man. However, with the passage of time, petitions have been filed which attempted to appropriate PIL for corporate gain, political advantage or personal interest. It is an undemocratic, unrealistic and dangerous tendency that is to be impeded by our judicial attitude.Public Interest Litigation is one of the revolutionary concepts aimed at extending its long arm of sympathy to the poor, the ignorant, the oppressed and the needy whose rights are infringed and whose suffering or grievances go unnoticed, unrepresented and unheard. This led to the dismantling of the traditional concept of locus standi and the court could be approached by any person espousing the case of the underprivileged, who were by themselves not in a position to access the courts. Public Interest Litigation has seriously reduced the efficiency of the judicial system by detracting from the ability of the court to devote its time and resources to cases that legitimately require attention. As easy access to the higher courts is provided to the people through Public Interest Litigation numerous frivolous cases have been filed. As these cases kept the courts busy it resulted in a lack of attention over other litigations. Many people filed cases for their own personal gain as it is easy as well as cheaper ways to seek justice. Though PIL is a valuable innovative judicial remedy its abuse becomes more rampant than its use. The overstepping of judiciary beyond the boundaries of its jurisdiction adversely affected the credibility of the process and doctrine of Public Interest Litigation as well as the orders of the judiciary which can’t be supervised or implemented effectively.It also led to the new problem which is unanticipated increase in the workload of the superior courts as well as the lack of infrastructure to determine the factual matter and gap between the promise and reality, abuse of power, friction and confrontation with fellow organs of the government, and dangers inherent in judicial populism.The Constitution of India doesn’t follow any strict separation of power as it still embodies the doctrine of checks and balances, which even the judiciary should respect but under the guise of redressing public grievances sometimes PIL encroached upon the sphere reserved by the Constitution of India which should not be done by the courts.The overuse of PIL for every conceivable public interest might dilute the original commitment to use this remedy only for enforcing human rights of the swindled and the disadvantaged groups. If civil society or disadvantaged groups lose optimism in the potency of PIL, that would sound a death knell for it.Public Interest Litigation or PIL, is a term that was adopted during the era of 1960s social turmoil in the United States.

    "headline": "Lawyers response to the BCI resolution over CAABCI not to grant affiliation to any new law colleges for next three yearsThe Free Press- Formulation and Disobedience SC gives a Big Statement on Fake Lawyers: Must Read",
    "data": "This article is written by Shilpa, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth.The Citizenship Amendment Act passed by our ruling government is facing protests nation wide as well as in other countries also. As per the reports atleast 17 people have died, including an eight years old child. Most of the protests are campus protests . This Act states that it will grant citizenship to all those migrants who migrated from neighbour countries like Bangladesh, Pakistan excluding specifically muslims. Protests are being carried out because this Act somewhere descriminates against minorities.People involved in these protests are mainly lawyers, students, law students, minorities. On these protests BCI chairman Manan Kumar Mishra on 22 December 2019 gave a resolution “the leaders of the Bar and young students are requested to take active role in diffusing the disturbances and violence in the country: we are convince the people and the illiterate ignorant mass, who are being misled by the some so-called leaders the matter with regard to Citizenship Amendment Act is under consideration of our Supreme Court, therefore everyone should await the decision of the apex court.” These statements are facing dissents of thousands of lawyers where member and vice chairman of the executive committee of BCI Advocate N. Manoj Kumar in his letter to the chairman said “protests against the CAA is an attempt to save the constitution and being the real torch bearers of the constitution it is the duty of every self-esteemed lawyer to lead the struggle to defend the Constitution.” Response to this resolution is signed by around thousand lawyers. According to them office bearers of the BCI are free to express their opinion in their personal capacity but using BCI as a platform to present their personal opinion is disservice to the BCIs principles. BCI is also facing dissents for his statements where they have called lakhs of citizens of India protesting in anguish as a illetirate ignorant mass. Lawyers response to BCI resolution is disstressing more of because BCI in resolution showed concern or solidarity for police and armed force personnel’s but not for advocates such as Mr. Shoaib who has been detained in Lucknow or the many advocates fighting to upholds rights of citizens granted by the Constitution. It is human nature to expect from their knowing ones or from their field members to support them if it does not happens dissents are always there in a civilized society and this response to the BCI’s resolution is somewhere the same. It is the time where we as a responsible citizens are need to understand that to convey our demand or we can say to demand our rights and justice in a democratic country, we have to demand them in a proper way, in a proper channel where we can convey our demand to the ruling government effectively without any violence as well as without troubling our motherland."

    "headline": "PAN- Aadhaar Linking: The 31 December, 2019 Deadline EXTENDEDMens rea : A demon of senseUNWINDING THE DISCRIMINATORY DRESS CODES FOR FEMALE IN INDONESIALOOPHOLES IN DOWRY LAWS",
    "data": "This article is written by Shambhavi, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth.What is PAN?Permanent Account Number or PAN is a means of identifying various taxpayers in the country. It is a ten-digit unique identification alphanumeric number containing both alphabets and numbers, assigned to Indians, mostly to those who pay tax. It is an electronic system through which, all tax related information for a person or company is recorded against a single PAN number. This acts as the primary key for storage of information and is shared across the country. It is issued in the form of a laminated tamper proof card by the Income Tax Department of India. Permanent Account Number is unique to an individual or entity and it is valid across India. Once PAN is allotted to an individual or entity is unaffected by a change of name, address within or across states in India or other factors. Why do we need PAN? The primary function of PAN is to bring a universal identification to all financial transactions and to prevent tax evasion by keeping track of monetary transactions, especially those of high-net-worth individuals who can impact the economy. PAN is mandatory when filing income tax returns, tax deduction at source, or any other communication with Income Tax Department. It is also steadily becoming a mandatory document for opening a new bank account, a new landline telephone connection, a mobile phone connection, purchase of foreign currency, bank deposits above the amount of 50,000, purchase and sale of immovable properties, vehicles etc. PAN has now taken on the role of “identifier” beyond the Income Tax Department as it is now required for various activities like opening of bank account, opening of demat accounts, obtaining registration for Service Tax, Sales Tax /VAT, Excise registration etc. It is leveraged to become Common Business Identification Number (CBIN) or simply Business Identification Number (BIN) for providing registration to a number of government departments and services.What is AADHAAR?Aadhaar number is a 12- digit random number issued by the Union Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) to the residents of India after satisfying the verification process laid down by the authority. Any individual, irrespective of age and gender, who is a resident of India, may voluntarily enrol to obtain Aadhaar number. Person willing to enrol has to provide minimal demographic and biometric information during the enrolment process which is totally free of cost. It is one of the world’s largest biometric ID system. Why do we need Aadhaar?There are various uses of Aadhar Card which are publicised by the government through awareness campaigns but there are few uses that many of the users would not be aware of. Aadhar can be used as identity card in availing of subsidies, acquisition of passport, opening bank accounts, digital life certificate, disbursing provident fund, LPG Subsidy and so on.Section 139AA Upheld By SC?The constitutional validity of section 139AA of the IT Act came into question before the Hon’ble Supreme Court. The Supreme Court upheld the constitutional validity of this section in entirety except for providing a partial relief. The relief was in respect of clause (d) above where the Supreme Court held that non obtaining of an Aadhaar number would not lead to PAN becoming invalid. Accordingly, all other provisions of Section 139AA in respect of quoting Aadhaar or Aadhaar enrolment number in the return of income or linking of Aadhaar with PAN etc would continue to hold good.The Supreme Court, in September last year, had declared the Centre’s flagship Aadhaar scheme as constitutionally valid and held that the biometric ID would remain mandatory for the filing of I-T returns and allotment of PAN.Section 139 AA (2) of the Income Tax Act says that every person having PAN as on July 1, 2017, and is eligible to obtain AADHAR, must intimate his/her Aadhaar number to tax authorities.The 31 December, 2019 DeadlineAs per the latest public message which has been given by Income Tax Department, it is mandatory to link your PAN with Aadhaar by the end of this year. The Department said, “Building a better tomorrow! To reap seamless benefits of income tax services, complete the vital link before 31st December, 2019.”Meanwhile there are various consequences if the individual doesn’t link PAN with Aadhaar. The PAN will become inoperative if it is not linked to Aadhaar till the 31st December deadline notified by the income tax department. This provision has come to effect from September 1, 2019, in keeping with the amended rule of July 2019. However, the government has till date not specified the meaning of the term ‘inoperative’ as used in the new rule.The last date for the mandatory linking of the Permanent Account Number (PAN) with Aadhaar has been extended from the earlier deadline of December 31, 2019 to the month of March, 2020. (Note: This was not a part of the original write-up)ConclusionIn order to protect the validity of transactions previously carried out through such PAN, it is proposed to amend the said provision so as to provide that if a person fails to intimate the Aadhaar number, the PAN allotted to such individual shall be made inoperative in the prescribed manner.

    "data": "This article is written by Shilpa, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth.A consumer is the user of any goods and services. Consumers are many a times exploited by manufacturer and shopkeepers for their profit, and the consumer faces two side loss of money extending to the loss of health, and second, in the form of defective goods. A consumer can be said to be cheated when he or she buys any goods or services but they do not get what was promised to them, and maybe there is some defect in goods and services as to the original one. To protect consumers from such frauds, many legislations have been enacted and campaigns are run by government, most famous and renowned ones being “Jago Grahak Jago”, magazine “Upbhokta Jagran” and “Sanrakshan Upbhokta ka” which is telecast on Doordarshan. These campaigns are to make the consumers aware of their rights, responsibilities, and the also how to tackle fraudulent manufacturers.Caveat Emptor is a Latin legal maxim which means ‘let the buyer beware’. The concept of the maxim is that a buyer should be aware while buying goods or services, and that they are themselves responsible for their rights. Buyers should make selection of goods or services after properly examining them and should buy the products only when they are satisfied with the quality of the product. There are certain points a person should keep in mind as a consumer:-1) Clear mind-set: What to buy- A person should go to buy goods or services with clear mind-set, without any confusion that what good or service he or she want and with what content. 2) Content of a commodity- As a consumer, a person should always check for the content that a commodity contains, they should see that if that content will suit her or him.3) MRP Check-A consumer should not pay to a shopkeeper more than MRP mentioned on the commodity even though shopkeeper demands for it.4) Weight Check- A consumer should check weight of the commodity that he or she is buying, they should make sure that weighing machine is properly working or not and the commodity weighs the same as it is mentioned on the commodity. 5) Duplication Check- The product that they are buying is of the original brand or not, or is there any duplication regarding the name, logo, packaging wrapper of a commodity.6) Quality Check- Whether the commodities they are buying are approved by the authorities, since such authorisation is a proof of the good quality and quantity of the commodity. Goods approved by assigned authorities contain marks like ISI, Agmark, Woolmark, FPO etc.7) Supplementary Products- While buying a commodity a person should look for other brands also of the same commodity so that he or she can get more options and fully satisfied with the content or nature of the commodity.8) Expiry date- Before buying any commodity a buyer should check for its expiry date first. In case of electronic gadgets a buyer should first check for its features, should go for demo, with this should make sure that a warranty card has been provided to them and free servicing is there for heavy electronics and machineries.9) Ask for Bill- It is a right of a consumer and duty of a seller that they provide cash memo to a buyer without any extra charges and if they don’t it is buyers’ responsibility to ask for. These are some basics that a person as a consumer or buyer should keep in mind while buying something. With these things a consumer have rights that a person should must be aware and exercise it. If a person who is not aware about his or her rights he or she is not only dangerous for themselves but for the society and country also. Basic rights of a consumer are:- Right to safety- consumer have a right to safety from those goods and services which can be prove hazardous to his health, life and property. Right to be informed- it is right of a consumer that they should be informed in detail about the goods and services they are buying and with this it is duty of the seller to provide information about the good and services. Right to choose- a consumer have a right that he or she can choose good and services according to their satisfaction, without any interference.

    "headline": "Decoding New India: CAB and NRC“WORK FROM HOME: A NEW NORMAL AND A COMPLETE PARADIGM SHIFT TO A NEW CULTURE”.NEW RULES ON CATTLE TRADEIs Hinduism a way of life or just a religion? SC to re-examine today",
    "data": "This article is written by Shambhavi, a student of Banasthali Vidyapeeth.Citizenship Amendment Bill or CAB, provides citizenship of India to those non- Muslims of Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who are in minority and are facing religious persecution, and also to members of these minorities who have migrated to India before December 31, 2014. According to the Bill, any day- crosser from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh who is ian adherent of the said communities will not be extradited or imprisoned if they are not carrying contractual or justifiable documents for their condominium in India. In other words, the CAB lay the foundations for Indian citizenship to lakhs of day crossers who discerned themselves with any of the given religions, even if they deficit any document to authenticate their residency.The Bill also includes two additional prerequisites on citizenship of illegal immigrants of these religions from the three countries. Further, the Bill adds that the provisions on citizenship for illegal migrants will not apply to tribal areas of Assam, Meghalaya, Mizoram, or Tripura, as included in the Sixth Schedule to the Constitution. National Register of Citizens or NRC is a process sighted at doffing illegal immigrants from India. This operation was lately accomplished in Assam. However, in present scenario the NRC is effectuated all over India. Under National Register of Citizens, a person is competent to be a citizen of India if they substantiate that either they or their progenitor were in India on or before March 24, 1971. The Assam NRC operation was commenced to prune out illegitimate Bangladeshi immigrants, who came into India during the India- Pakistan war in 1971, which led to the origination of Bangladesh. Though both Citizenship Amendment Bill or CAB and National Register of Citizens or NRC are opposed nationwide but there are some major differences between both. These are: 1. CAB will provide Indian Citizenship based on religion while on the other hand NRC has nothing to do with the religion. 2. CAB is likely to perquisite non-Muslim day-crossers, whereas, NRC is intended to repatriation of all illegal day-crosser irrespective of their religions.3. CAB endows citizenship to non – Muslim day-crossers from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh while NRC in Assam was pursued at recognizing illegitimate day- crossers mostly from Bangladesh. Basically, the Home Ministry clarified that the CAB has nothing to do with NRC.The Ministry stated that the legal provisions of NRC have been a part of the Citizenship Act, 1955 since December 2004. There are also precise statutory rules of 2003 to invoke the legal provisions. The provisions superintend the process of registration of Indian citizens and the dissemination of national identity cards to them. The Ministry said that the CAB has not permuted the legal provision in any way and added saying that the propitious rules under CAB are being composed.Though by recognising only non – Muslim communities and excluding Muslims from the provisions of CAB it is very unfaithful for those Muslims who bear the Muslim identity but face persecution and threat on their fundamental rights and life. The terminology used in the Bill is not the problem at the ideological level but the wretched conception behind it is the main disturbing element. It seems like that the Bill passed in the Indian Parliament is based on communal specification. Consequently, law fails to address the social layers, hierarchies, and nuances of alienation that these ideological orphans are subject to. It is to paint with a very wide brush and in blood, to say that only religious minorities face communal oppression, or that it is only the non-Muslim communities that suffer at the hands of the parties of God in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, and Pakistan.Under the Preamble and in certain articles of the Constitution the Government is prohibited to premise any legislature based on religion. The Secular ethos opens up space where an individual can be granted and guaranteed rights on their own virtues – ideally by the virtue of being born as epitomised in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, to which, India voted favourably.As we celebrate the International Human Rights Day on 10th of December, space for the individual to be emancipated from the identity and categories of religion shrinks. We turn our faces away from people who face oppression at the hands of religious extremism but are not ‘persecuted enough’ for us to recognise them as eligible for asylum in the world’s largest democracy. They face discrimination under this Bill on account of their Muslim identity. The United Nation’s Human Rights Body termed the Citizenship Amendment Bill as Fundamentally discriminatory in nature; the redrafted law would occur to erode the adherence to equality before the law manifested in India’s Constitution and India’s devoir under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the Convention for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, to which Indian is a State party, which interdict discrimination on the basis of racial, ethnic or religious grounds."

    "headline": "Cyber Security in India: All You Need to Know About ItCRZ Violation: SC orders status quoVALIDITY OF PETITION FILED AGAINST SECTION 188 OF IPCSC sets record by recommending 51 names for High Court Judges: Read to Know More",
    "data": "INTRODUCTIONHuman behavior and human thoughts co-relate each with other and they consist of our cognitive instincts which include desire, consciousness, memory, perception etc. The imbalance of these instincts leads to the commission of a crime. Society is gradually and progressively developing and technology is playing a major role in that development. The way of working in our society is getting easier now because of technology. The invention of technology has always benefitted the society but it is always on the people to either use it effectively or to misuse it. Generally, the people involved in cybercrimes are those people who are socially very inactive or introverts but they seem to be very interested in social media. They commit such crimes are if they are suffering from Rejection Sensitive Dysphoria (RSD). It is mostly an emotional relation where they step into mischievous acts like Pornography. We might also take into account those people who wish to earn a large amount of money but by fraud. The concept of Cyber Security came into being to protect the people from such crimes. WHAT IS CYBER SECURITY?Cyber Security is a tool which is used to protect users from cyber-attacks. It protects the network, programs data, and personal information in a computer from the attacks of Cyber Crimes. Areas covered by cyber security are:-The various measures are taken to protect the life cycle development of an application from the threats of outsiders.This is used to encounter unauthorized access from breaching the privacy of the user.It is used in the business cycle to recover its plan from a disaster so as to resume the normal business operation.It takes into account the usage, reliability, and safety of the network. The security is basically to focus on the threat to the network.Cyber attackers in today’s world are frequently targeting the females through creating a fake id or by pornography etc. There are certain cases where females are trapped in the evil plan of the attackers. So it has become important to secure the networks, data, programs, personal information, etc. Attackers are also a threat to the banking system of the country where the individual receives the text messages about the crediting of the money from the bank which is basically a fake text from attackers and it looks so real that the account holder shares its account and card details which results in the withdrawal of the huge amount. Cyber Security is also used to protect national data from hackers and attackers.HISTORY OF CYBER SECURITY1. The initial stage of cyber security was to throw light on individual computers to protect them from VITAL INFORMATION RESOURCES UNDER SEIZE (VIRUS) attacks.2. The second stage of evolution draws the attention to IT and Network Security, so it was observed that in this stage the attack to the user of the individual computer affects the overall network the user is connected with.3. The last stage explains the current status of cyber security where the scope of this technique is widened and made more comprehensive as the attacks have become more complexed.NEED OF CYBER SECURITYTYPES OF CYBER SECURITYCyber security protects the user from the unauthorized access of computer with the intention to misuse the data of it. There are five types of cyber security:- Critical infrastructure security consists of the modernized physical system on which today’s generation relies on. Thus there is a need to protect the organization from the vulnerabilities of cyber-attacks.It is one of the most important systems to be protected against cyber attacks. They used both software and hardware facilities to overcome the threat and to tackle the problem of cyber-attack. There are three types of application security:-These types of securities help to prevent unauthorized access of the computer.The focus of cyber security is on outside threats. It helps in preventing unauthorized access to the network. The network management has implemented a lot of rules and regulations with the procedure to guard against cyber attack. For example, extra logins, new passwords, etc.The development in the area of cyber security was when cloud security was introduced. It is software-based security that protects and monitors the data in the cloud security resource. It has been a myth among people that cloud security is not safe. People also believe that data is more secured if it is saved in a physical server which one can own and control.IoT contains critical and non-critical systems like applications, sensor, television, Wi-Fi, routers, and security cameras are very sensitive and important to secure. CYBER SECURITY THREATSThe technologies are invented with the aim that it would make a person’s life easier and simple to work, but everything invented or created has its own flaws. Likewise, cyber security is becoming a threat in itself. Cyber attackers are very well versed with this technology and they are very capable to abuse the technique of security. India is on the path of digitalization but there are loose ends of it.Challenges faced:-With growing technologies and easier ways of it, people tend to use the technology for net banking transaction which is majorly targeted.The supply chain of the network is interconnected. Nowadays companies tend to offer their networks to vendors and customers which increased the rate to abuse Hacking is the intrusion with unauthorized access to destroy the data of the user.It is also the new way out to take revenge.It is a process when the hackers send fake emails, text messages or create a website with the malicious intention to commit a fraudulent act.CYBER SECURITY IN INDIACybercrime is an unlawful act wherein the computer is used as a target, as a weapon or for terrorism. The term is basically used to emphasize on legal issues related to the use of communication technologies in which major focus is on cyberspace i.e. the internet. It involves criminal activities such as threat, fraud, forgery, defamation, and mischief; all of these offenses are governed under IPC the threat of cyber-attack gave birth to the Information Technology Act, 2002. To protect cyber security, cyber laws have been made. These rules are important as they cover all the aspects of transaction and activities concerning the internet. When the internet was invented the fathers of the internet did not think of such cyber-attacks… CYBER SECURITY MEASURESAccording to current statistics, Cyber crime is increasing on a daily basis. The attackers are now capable of destroying cyber security. All these acts have compelled the government to make a number of legislative, technical, institutional measures to solve the issues of cyber security. It includes the National Cyber Security Policy 2013, IT Act 2000, Indian computer emergency response team (CERT-In).CONCLUSIONTo summarize, information is an integral part of an organization and is a very important tool for a person’s private life also. Cyber crimes are a new trend to run away from laws but that’s not simple. Our cyber security laws play a protective tool to get rid of such offenses and also to punish those who commit these offenses. They act as a safeguard for the social and virtual life of an individual. Regardless of all these laws, our protection is still in our hands. ByPragya SrivastavaBanasthali VidyapithTo secure the application Information securityDisaster recovery Network security Cyber Security techniques are not much old or sophisticated but now they are very difficult and complicated due to increasing rates of cyber-attacks.The evolution of the technique has different phases in the history of cyber security:-In India, the business sector is owned by both private and public companies which have their own rules and regulations to protect their infrastructure, their confidential plans from cyber-attacks. The Indian armed forces also have their own officers and agencies to look after the threat of cyber-attack. With all such measures, there is still a lack of proper national security which would effectively work in accordance with the complexity of the attack.The youth of India has thorough knowledge about the IT field but when it comes to cyber security they lack in performance. It can be due to their vocational training or limited knowledge. So this again demands to fill the gap of how to protect ourselves from the cyber-attack. It indicates the need for cyber security in a coordinated fashion.Further, focusing on the security breaches at national level which causes a loss to the society in monetary basis, Armed forces, banking system, national plan secrecy are the important material of the country which are the victims of cyber-attacks from other countries. There is a need for an organization to provide effective measures and training to get rid of the threats of the attack.In India, there is no such regulatory body to rule or direct about the legal framework of cyber security. In a developing country like India, there are groups varying in accordance with their income. So, it is again a demand for systematic and well-coordinated security for the users. As this gap between rich and poor depicts that there is a use of higher-cost cells as well as lower cost cells. That is what shows the impossibility to reach out and make people aware of a legal framework to the various sections of the society.Critical infrastructure security;Application security Anti-VirusFirewallsEncryption program.Network securityCloud security Internet of things security( IoT)Digital data threat Supply chain inter-connection HackingPhishingNational Cyber Security Coordinator ( NCSC). Under National Security Council Secretariat (NSCS) these agencies coordinate with each other to look into the issues of cyber security.IT Act, 2000 was also enacted with the vision to provide legal recognition to electronic communication, commerce, and cybercrimes. The Act is deterrent in nature to deal with the cyber threat and attacks.The alerts and advisories about the cyber threat are led by the Indian Computer Emergency Response Team.To protect the critical information infrastructure in the country, the National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre has been established.The Chief Information Security Officer issues guidelines regarding the roles and responsibilities of securing the application.To detect the malicious program and to remove the same Cyber Swachhta Kendra has been launched."

    "data": "Ram Boolchand Jethmalani was a well- known Indian lawyer and politician born on September 14, 1923, in Shikarpur of Sindh province. He had an interest in law and pursued it despite being highly criticized and chided by his father. He got his LL.B. degree at the age of 17 and started practicing law in his hometown Karachi until the partition of India. He fought the very first case at the age of 17 in the court of Sindh under Justice Godfrey Davis, contesting the rule regarding the minimum age passed by the bar council of Sindh. Though at that time the minimum age for becoming a lawyer was 21, he made an application to the court contesting the rule regarding minimum age. As a result of this, the court allowed him to become a lawyer at the age of 18. He worked for many years in the Supreme Court and was regarded as the highest-paid lawyer in the country because of his ability to turn around the hardest of cases. He defended many high profile personalities including renowned politicians and gangsters throughout his career. He moved to Bombay in the year 1948 and started practicing in Bombay. In 1954, he became a part-time professor at the Government Law College, Mumbai. He earned a reputation of being a smuggler’s lawyer after he defended Haji Mastan, in a smuggling case. In 1988, he became a member of the Rajya Sabha. In 1996, when the Government of India was led by Mr. Atal Bihari Vajpayee, he became the Union Minister of Law, Justice and Urban Development.

It was his appearance in the famous Nanavati case in 1959 with YV Chandrachud who later became India’s Chief Justice that first brought Jethmalani into the spotlight.

In 1977, he returned and contested the General Elections where he defended law minister HR Gokhale. He was often seen as a crusader for lost causes: from Balbir, assassins of Indira Gandhi, to underworld don Haji Mastan, stock scamster Harshad Mehta, conspirators in the Rajiv Gandhi assassination case and Jessica Lal’s murderer Manu Sharma. Along with Advocate Kamini Jaiswal, Mr. Jethmalani successfully defended former Delhi University lecturer Syed Abdul Rahman Geelani, who was a suspect in the 2001 Parliament attacks by Jaish-e-Mohammad. Jaiswal said that she was ‘very disturbed’ by Jethmalani’s decision to defend Manu. 11 High profile cases where Mr. Ram Jethmalani appeared for an opposition party:He has argued for people whose social background and political ideology are vastly different from his own. He claimed that he had fought 90 percent cases free of cost. He also contended that he would not take a single penny from Delhi Minister Arvind Kejriwal for defending him in a defamation case slapped on him by former Finance Minister Mr. Arun Jaitley.Mr. Ram Jethmalani died on 8th September 2019 in New Delhi at his home. He was unwell for the last few months and died six days short of his 96th Birthday. Mr. Jethmalani’s death is a huge loss to the entire legal fraternity. He was cremated at Delhi’s Lodhi Road Crematorium on the very evening.

    "data": "Aruna Ramchandra Shanbaug vs Union of India (2011) Does a terminally ill person have the right to hasten his/her death by asking for either his medical treatment to be withdrawn or for a lethal injection to be administered to end his/her suffering? After the case of Aruna Shanbaug, the position of euthanasia in India is that while the law recognizes euthanasia in case of physical suffering, no amount of mental suffering would justify a claim to end a person’s life.As per Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code, if an adult person voluntarily attempts suicide, he/she risks being punished if his/her attempt fails. This is inconsistent. Lawmakers seriously debate the Supreme Court’s recommendation to delete Section 309 of the IPC.Doctors have documented that passive euthanasia is already practiced in India. The Supreme Court’s decision is added to the guidelines formulated by it and is meant to operate until the Legislature enacts a suitable law on the issue. Parliament legalizes passive euthanasia in India under strict guidelines since 2018. Patients must give consent through a living will, and must be either terminally ill or in a vegetative state. MC Mehta vs Union of India (Ganga Pollution)(1988)The Ganga is one of the most sacred rivers of India and billions of people live along with its course. The river receives most of the toxic waste from the domestic and industrial sector of the city. The waste dumped in the river is particularly from the leather industry tanneries of Kanpur.The Court highlighted various constitutional provisions such as Article 48 and Article 51-A of Constitution under which it is the duty of the citizens to protect and preserve natural environment including forests, rivers, lakes, and wildlife. The Court also stated the importance of The Water Act, 1974 which was passed to control water pollution and to maintain water quality. The court came up with various guidelines and said that if any applications came for the establishment of industries under the jurisdiction where Ganga river flows then it has to be refused unless there are adequate provisions for the treatment of trade effluents flowing out of the factories.Keeping in view the provisions given under Article 51-A of the Constitution, the Supreme Court further ordered that :Central Government is duty-bound to direct all the educational institutions throughout India to teach lessons relating to the protection and the improvement of the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife in the first ten classes. The Central Government shall get textbooks written for the said purpose and distribute them to the educational institutions free of cost. Children should be taught about the need for maintaining their surroundings as it leads to a healthy body and healthy mind. Training of teachers who teach this subject by the introduction of short term courses for such training shall also be considered. This should be done throughout India.Kesavananda Bharti vs State of Kerala(1973)India has often faced situations where its paramount democratic institutions have clashed. One such run-in was the struggle for power between the Judiciary and the Legislature.It is one of the best known constitutional decision of the Supreme Court of India. It was held that no amendment can violate the basic structure of the Constitution. There are no implied limitations on the powers of the Parliament to amend the Constitution. It also established the right of the Supreme Court to review and establish its supremacy on Constitutional matters.It has played a very important and remarkable role in preserving the Parliamentary democracy of India. But with the changing incidents, the implications of this case are becoming apparent. It is clear that its complexity and lack of clarity on some important questions are left to be decided by the posterity.Indira Gandhi vs. Raj Narain(1975)Raj Narain filed a petition accusing Indira Gandhi of malpractice in the General Election. The Court held that she couldn’t practice as the Prime Minister and couldn’t participate in the elections for the coming six years. Aggrieved by this decision, Indira Gandhi made an appeal in the Supreme Court but due to holiday nothing was executed. The emergency was declared and it was said that there were some internal disturbances in the country but the emergency was declared due to this judgment of Allahabad High Court.Supreme Court had given its first judgment in which the basic doctrine was applied to save the Constitution from malicious attacks. The five-Judge bench held that the Parliament is just elected to make laws which are beneficial to the “people of India” and not those laws which are beneficial for them. This judgment was the triumph of the Rule of Law because once again it was the law that proved to be superior and not those who made it. The Apex Court proved that law is supreme and it cannot be brought to knees even by the chosen ones.India is the largest democracy in the world. The essence of a democratic government lies in the conduct of free & fair elections. The Parliament tried to cast the basic essence towards their end so that they could have the entitlement to validate an invalid election. Joseph Shine vs Union Of India (Adultery Case) (2018)The verdict which was given by the Supreme Court declaring that Adultery is not a crime was widely welcomed by the entire nation. Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code deals with the offence of adultery and was eradicated by the Court, holding it manifestly arbitrary, archaic and violative of the Right to Equality and Equal opportunity to Women.It is one of the historical judgments which retracted the antiquated law in Sec 497 of IPC, under which women were treated as the property of husbands. Adultery can still be a ground for divorce. By this judgment, the patriarchal control of men over women is obliterated.People’S Union For Civil … vs Union Of India &Anr(NOTA Judgment)(2013)The Supreme Court passed a remarkable judgment which paved the way of electoral reform in the history of Indian socio-political system. Under the light of this judgment, the Election Commission made a provision for the option of the “None of the Above” in the ballot paper or electronic voting machine.By giving the option of NOTA or negative vote, the Election Commission of India brought a new aspect of Democracy of India. People now will be competent to exhibit their despondency with the party’s choice of candidates or their stratagem.The citizens can now congruously enjoy their ‘Right to Freedom and Expression’ in the elections and as well as in the voting procedure. This is the real meaning of Democracy under which people of the country could restrain the political parties and compelled them to change their agenda as well as the candidates.But this system will be effective only when the law provides the provision of re-election. In the present scenario, a vote in the NOTA is still wasted as it doesn’t affect the election result as well as its procedure.Vishakha vs State of Rajasthan(1997)In an emerging Indian economy, as more and more women have started to work, the malady of sexual harassment at the workplace has geared its ugly face in all fields. Though various guidelines were given by the Supreme Court to attenuate the predicament by its judgment in 1997, various laws and Acts were introduced by the Parliament for the welfare and protection of women at the workplace but in spite of that women are still harassed at the workplace very frequently. As per a survey, many employers are yet to constitute a complaint committee for women. Unfortunately, despite the strides made by Vishakha, its guidelines have operated as a remedial rather than preventive measure.While Vishakha is only enforced from case to case, a law would be enforced in all cases. The workplace can become truly gender sensitized only when there is proper legislation for the same. Olga Tellis vs Bombay Municipal Corporation(1985)This case highlighted the connection between the Right to livelihood and the proximity of slums to the workplace. Hence, the right to shelter was constitutionally protected through its indirect but inevitable link with the right to livelihood. However, subsequent decisions recognized that the right to housing was independently a part and parcel of the Right to life.Although this case has not been formally overruled, its scope and effect have been significantly weakened from 1990 onwards. Yet, as a Constitutional-Bench judgment of one of the most powerful courts in the world, it still acts as a strong reminder that the Court will not remain a silent spectator when Human Rights of the lowest rungs of the society are about to be trampled upon.State Through Reference vs Ram Singh &Ors(Nirbhaya Case)(2013)In a country like India, the statistics of rape is petrifying. But, one incident which completely shook the entire country was the Nirbhaya episode. A rape case that left people numb and brought billions of together against this heinous crime. The severity of this case not only brought the question of women safety in the state or country but even questioned the legal system which the people do not fear. This incident sparked many legal reforms in the country. A committee, called the Verma Committee was established for the recommendations and reforms and it recommended various policies. The government also passed various amendments and has also been prompt in creating consciousness programs at grass root levels and in educating children about sex and introducing literacy programs for women. In spite of all these amendments and reforms, several key recommendations of the Verma Committee on the criminalisation of marital rape, monitoring of illegal patriarchial villages like Khap panchayats and review of security laws in conflict zones have still been ignored.India is still the most unsafe country for women. The increasing crime rate shows that Delhi is still under a dark shadow of these crimes but it has definitely paved a way towards improving the state of safety of women and brought forth the fact that the society is determined to take action against such issues.Navtej Singh Johar vs. Union of India ( Section-377)(2018)The Supreme Court has decided on its own wisdom and decriminalized Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. It was one of the most discussed and tensed topics in the Legislature and Judiciary of the country. But the five-Judge Constitutional Bench scrapped it out from the Code and decriminalized the colonial law which was continued from the last 158 years which criminalized consensual gay sex.After this judgment, the LGBTQ may have an enabling platform to come out but their fight still has a long way to go. There is still a large portion of the population which is not in the favor and is still living with the ancient orthodox thinking. But after this historic and path-breaking judgment, the people of that community can live with dignity and they also have same rights and privileges which is provided to all the citizens of the nation and no one can question their conduct or privacy anymore.Written ByShambhaviBanasthali Vidyapith"

The Collegium has already transferred Chief Justice of Meghalaya High Court, Justice AK Mittal, to the Madras High Court.Justice A K Mittal who is currently the Chief Justice of Meghalaya is all set to take over as the Chief Justice of Madras High Court. He is junior to Justice Tahilramani by three years of service. Justice Tahilramani, who became a judge of Bombay High Court in June 2001, was appointed as the Chief Justice of Madras High Court in August 2018.

    "data": "What if one day while you’re surfing the internet, you find an indecent image of your minor relative going viral? Or what if you being a minor, find a photo you sent to a specific person, not to be shared with anyone else but him/her, going viral on the internet?With the development of new technologies, the new methods of crime are coming into picture and child pornography is one such crime.A child is a person who is below the age of 18 years. Child pornography is publishing and transmitting obscene material of children in electronic form. In recent years, child pornography has amplified due to the easy right to use the internet. Child pornography is the most monstrous crime which occurs and has led to various other crimes such as sex tourism, sexual abuse of children, etc. Child pornography being a crime in India is punishable under The Information Technology Act, 2000 & Indian Penal Code, 1860. Children in the present-day era are exposed to the highest tech globalized world which influences them and takes those children to new heights of understanding, modernity, and mellowness. Since a child has a delicate and vulnerable mind, sometimes it is difficult for the child to contain from the negativities of modern information technology and social media. They get easily fascinated by the bliss of knowing things from an early age; to be socially active and befriend new people. They enter into the adult chat rooms and because of the growing age, they enjoy the delight of chatting with an adult or virtually connecting with them. Young children and their friends involve in sexting which means “the process of sending and receiving sexual images on a mobile phone.” They upload explicit and obscene photos, messages and videos in their peer group which is at the end of the day easily accessible to the perpetrators of child pornography because of the cyberspace. Young kids also upload obscene pictures of their friends so as to torment them. As a result, the victims of such abuse sometimes commit suicide.With this increasing trend, The Government of India realized the need for introducing a new law and for making suitable amendments to the existing laws, and so, on February 2009, the Parliament of India passed the Information Technology Bill which made construction and transmission of child pornography illegal. The newly passed Information Technology Bill is set to make it not only the transmission of child pornography in any electronic form illegal but also the browsing of such content. Section 67B of the IT Act specifically proposes to punish taking part in sexually explicit online or electronic content that depicts children. It will also be an offense to “cultivate, entice or induce children to online relationship with other children for a sexual act.”The demonstration of something offensive to modesty or graciousness or expression of unchaste or lustful ideas or being filthy or lewd is considered to be obscene in most countries. So, to control child pornography in India, we should take stringent actions to solve the problem. Parents should interact regularly with their children, school authorities should try to create awareness among the students and media should also play an active role in educating and sensitizing the society. This would give us time to think and plan some new ways to eradicate child pornography from India. Depiction of minors, both real and virtual, as well as adults appearing to be minors, in electronic child pornography, should be prevented by Indian law. Stringent measures must be taken to combat such heinous abuse.by :-Nandani Agarwal"

    "headline": "Public Masturbation: A Victimless CrimeNew Laws Enforced from May 1 in IndiaIS IT TIME THAT INDIA ABOLISHES DEATH PENALTY?Indian Sedition Law & its aspects",
    "data": "Have you ever caught a man in a public place, staring at you and masturbating? Is the desire to avoid being masturbated to a constant thrum of thought? Did you say yes? Well, every victim would, because we live in a society where people in their chaotic households try to find a quiet corner to do it, while these men very shamelessly air their desires.If you ever discuss this topic with others you may find that you are not alone. There are many people, mostly women, who have been a sufferer of public masturbation. To avoid being masturbated to is a constant thrum of thought because being the object of someone’s public masturbation always feels being violated in some way. Not physically violated, as the victim is not being touched or injured in any corporal way, but personally violated. Being masturbated at would easily be passed off as an act of ‘victimless crime’.In India, the cases of public masturbation can be filed under Section 354 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which concerns “assault or criminal force to woman with intent to outrage her modesty”; Section 509 which concerns “gesture or act intended to insult the modesty of a woman”; and/or Section 268, which handles cases of public nuisance.But the question here is: What do these men get out of it?According to the Schizophrenia Research Foundation (SCARF) “the thrill of pleasure at being seen, of watching people’s reactions, of inciting fear, may all be part of the turn on for the perpetrators. It could also be a part of sexual addiction or part of compulsive behaviour…” But there is also some amount of voyeurism present, and it may be the case that the psychology of a public masturbator may go further than the voyeuristic tendencies. A lot of public masturbators may go through paraphilia — a condition where one has fetishes towards strange objects or phenomenon. Voyeurism is just one of them. It’s not a disease as much as it is an irrepressible fetish. Everyone has a fad—some people have foot, role-play and cross-dressing fads. But with public masturbators, the difference is that their obsession harms the object of their fetish i.e. the women in public. The difference between most fetishes and public masturbation is that acting on the former is consensual, while the latter isn’t.Public masturbation actually leaves a victim feeling the same way as other sexual crimes do: horror-struck, furious and violated. It takes up space in their minds that they could all use for something else. Meanwhile the committers of this horrendous act continue their crude acts because they can easily escape on the grounds that they didn’t touch the “violated person”. That is why if the issue of public masturbation continues to be silently accepted, and consciously ignored, then the message we send to perpetrators is that they are doing nothing wrong whereas we all know the affect this act has on its victims. It does not just disgust them to the core but it also leaves them in a state of life long fear and shame. They would definitely be scared to be at the same place, or in a similar situation. The issue needs to be talked about at the very moment. People need to come forward and talk and take action against this disgusting activity that is messing with people’s sanity for a long time now.

    "headline": "FLAWS IN ALTERNATE DISPUTE RESOLUTION TECHNIQUESAUDIT QUALITY SHOULD NOT BE COMPROMISED – BY RENDERING NON-AUDIT SERVICESPLAY THE DEVIL’S ADVOCATE: CAREER IN CORPORATE LAWLIFE IMPRISONMENT-AN ALTERNATIVE TO CAPITAL PUNISHMENT",
    "data": "Alternative dispute resolution (ADR; known in some countries, such as India, as external dispute resolution) includes dispute resolution processes and techniques that act as a means for disagreeing parties to come to an agreement short of litigation. It is a collective term for the ways that parties can settle disputes, with (or without) the help of a third party.Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) is generally classified into at least four types: negotiation, mediation, collaborative law, and arbitration. (Sometimes a fifth type, conciliation, is included as well, but for present purposes it can be regarded as a form of mediation. ADR can be used alongside existing legal systems such as Sharia Courts within common law jurisdictions such as the UK.ADR is of two historic types. First, methods for resolving disputes outside of the official judicial mechanisms. Second, informal methods attached to or pendant to official judicial mechanisms. There are in addition free-standing and or independent methods, such as mediation programs and ombudsman offices within organizations. The methods are similar, whether or not they are pendant, and generally use similar tool or skill sets, which are basically sub-sets of the skills of negotiation.The techniques of ADR suffer from many disadvantages. Generally, arbitrators can only resolve disputes that involve money. They cannot issue orders requiring one party to do something, or refrain from doing something (also known as injunctions). They cannot change title to property, either. Also, some of the safeguards designed to protect parties in court may not be present in ADR. These might include the liberal discovery rules used in U.S. courts, which make it relatively easy to get evidence from the other party in a lawsuit.Also, there is very limited opportunity for judicial review of an arbitrator’s decision. While a large arbitration service could, if it so chose, have some kind of process for internal appeals, the decision is usually final and binding, and can only be reviewed by a court in limited cases. This generally happens when the original arbitration agreement is found to be invalid. Because both parties must voluntarily agree to arbitration, if the consent of one party is obtained by fraud or force, it will not be enforced. Also, if the decision of the arbitrator is patently unfair, it will not be enforced. This is a difficult standard to meet. The fact that the arbitrator made a decision that the court would not have made is not, by itself, a basis to overturn the decision.A court might also overturn an arbitrator’s decision if it decided issues that were not within the scope of the arbitration agreement.Nowadays, computers and internet are being used in the techniques of ADR. This helps in faster resolution. It also speeds up the conciliation process. Despite advantages, it has many disadvantages.Problems of ADR in Cyberspace:Compliance with Due ProcessThe attributes most commonly associated with ADR and with ADR in Cyberspace in particular are: simple, cheap and fast. However, there is a ramification to the simplicity: Compliance with basic due process requirements. While ADR is not technically bound to follow due porcess requirements, an appearance of fairness is essential for a dispute resolution mechanism to function effectively. Only compliance with basic due-process requirements can give ADR in Cyberspace the trust it needs to function effectively for a wide range of disputes.Difficulties in EnforcementDue to the borderless nature of Cyberspace, ADR in Cyberspace faces a variety of enforcement issues in both enforcing the agreement to conduct an ADR proceeding and enforcement of the actual award.The first hurdle to overcome in order to enforce an ADR proceeding is to enforce the very agreement that includes the ADR provision.Among the most recent developments in law is not only the law of Cyberspace, but also consumer protection laws. These are a serious hindrance for ADR, especially in e-commerce cases, because they set up strict legal regimes that need to be followed in a dispute with a customer. In order to protect the customer from the superior bargaining power of the merchant, many countries have laws that prohibit abridging the customers right to resort to a court to resolve the dispute.Even if the agreement is binding and the award can be enforced, such enforcement might still be impracticable. First, the other party may be in a distant country, or may not be located at all.Secondly, if the party does not comply, suit has to be brought, possibly in a distant country. This would eliminate all the benefits derived from the ADR in the first place and effectively render it useless. Unless parties can be sure that awards can be enforced easily and without further costs, for example by directly granting the award from a pre-established fund or escrow account, ADR in Cyberspace may not earn the confidence of users.One of the often overlooked flipsides of cheap dispute resolution is funding. If ADR is to be viable for consumers and small claims, it has to be cheap. On the other hand, significant resources have to be used to build the online systems as well as paying staff and unbiased arbitrators.The funding issue may be one reason why many of the current methods of ADR in Cyberspace are either government mandated (like chargebacks) or connected to a major company, like the E-bay system. Independent systems like the WIPO have to charge fees. While these fees are small for the disputes that are currently handled, like IP and domain name disputes, they would scarcely be viable for consumer disputes.The security of communications issue is a big concern in Cyberspace. Even though new encryption technologies are constantly invented, every encryption can eventually be broken. The internet poses a lot more threats to confidential communication than a face to face communication in an office.A related problem is Authenticity: current e-mail and other communication technologies lack a safe method of authenticating the sender of the message on the one hand, and proving receipt by the recipient on the other.Without a safe authentication method, it would be possible for a third party to intervene and misrepresent one of the parties. This is especially true where the system allows the parties to access documents electronically, which included the possibility that third parties might gain access.Due to the high costs of litigation, alternatives have arisen to provide a means to solving legal disputes. Some disadvantages of the types of ADR are discussed below:Arbitration is basically a mini-trial with one or more arbitrators hearing the case and issuing their decision. The disadvantages of arbitration are the potential for a partial arbitrator or panel of arbitrators (arbitrators are often chosen by each party); little explanation is usually given for the basis of a decision; and when arbitration is binding (it often is), there is little recourse for the losing party.Mediation involves an impartial mediator facilitating discussions between the parties by using techniques that encourage dialogue that would not otherwise take place. Disadvantages of mediation are that it is usually binding on the parties, so a party is in trouble if they later change their mind later on. Another disadvantage is that both sides must be willing to discuss the disagreement and cooperate with the process. Unlike litigation, a party in mediation can suddenly decide to leave. Mediation’s other disadvantage is that it lacks procedural rules that protect the parties. For example, there is no formal discovery process in mediation. This means that it’s easier for one side to use secrets to its advantage.A quick, inexpensive and binding resolution is almost always the desired way to settle a dispute. The way to achieve this is by negotiation. The problem is that negotiation is far from guaranteed to succeed before it is necessary to resort to some other more formal and structured method of dispute resolution. This may take the form of mediation.The conciliation process can be an invaluable tool to reduce intractable conflict in cases where obstacles prevent out of court settlements and cost-effective resolutions. Its cons are:-The process is not legally binding-No decision is guaranteed at the end-The process could be considered too informal so parties may not take it seriously-No appeals-No legal aid.Hence, summarizing the topic, the main flaws in ADR techniques are:It is believed that the “take it or leave it” principle of alternative dispute resolution clauses would work in favor of the richer or more influential party over the party with less power and shallower pockets.The fact that hearings in this legal procedure are generally held in private, instead of being held in an open courtroom, and decisions are mostly not accessible to the public. While this is considered as a benefit by some people, this lack of transparency can also make the procedure more biased or tainted, which can become a big problem as decisions would be so infrequently put under review by the court.In alternative dispute resolution, choosing an arbitrator would not be objective, especially when the one who makes the decision is chosen by an agency from a pool list where individuals who have become favorites might get assigned to cases more often. Aside from this, many of the national alternative dispute resolution groups market their services actively to organizations and businesses that sell goods or issue credit cards to consumers, which creates additional questions on neutrality. After all, arbitrators, who are chosen by a party within an industrial niche, might be less objective and would be biased to the appointing group.Despite, these flaws, Alternative dispute resolution (ADR) gives parties in dispute the opportunity to work through disputed issues with the help of a neutral third party. It is generally faster and less expensive than going to court.By:AMISHA BANSALUFYLC, JAIPUR Enforcement of ADR Agreements Additional costs Funding Security of Communications Authenticity Arbitration Mediation Negotiation Conciliation It promotes an uneven playing field It lacks transparency It comes with questionable objectivity"

It is known to everyone that companies choose their own Auditors and pick those with whom they have the best ‘cultural fit’ or ‘chemistry’ rather than those who offer the toughest scrutiny. Those who hold that view are of the opinion that the only solution is for Auditors to be prevented from providing any services other than audit, to their audit Clients.PECUNIARY RELATIONSHIPThe prime motive of introducing the provisions of Section 144 of the Companies Act, 2013 is apparently to ensure the enhanced independence and accountability of the Auditors.

The concerns regarding such Non-Audit services are two-fold:First, Auditors may not stand up to the management of the Auditee Company because the Auditors wish to retain the additional income from Non-Audit services to the Company;Second, providing a range of services to the management may lead to the Auditor identifying too closely with the management’s interests and lose their professional skepticism.Policymakers globally have responded by prohibiting Auditors from performing some specific Non-Audit functions. Policymakers have also intensely debated the need to impose a cap on the Non-Audit fees of audit firms. It has been repeatedly asserted that Auditors must be independent in fact and in appearance. Independence-in-fact is defined as the Auditor’s mental state lacking any bias, while independence-in-appearance is a public perception that the Auditor is objective and unaffected by a financial interest in the Client.Institute of Chartered Accountants (ICAI)The ICAI’s Ethical Code forbids Auditors to provide Non-Audit services to audit Clients that would present a threat to their independence for which no adequate safeguards are available. Guidance Note on Independence of Auditors issued by ICAI provides valuable inputs to understand the same. Para 1.9 of the said note states that “the Auditor should be straight-forward, honest and sincere in his approach to his professional work. He must be fair and must not allow prejudice or bias to override his objectivity.One should maintain an impartial attitude and both be and appear to be free of any Interest which might be regarded, whatever its actual effect, as being incompatible with integrity and objectivity. This is not self-evident in the exercise of the reporting function but also applies to all other professional work. In determining whether a member in practice is or is not seen to be free of any interest which is incompatible with objectivity, the criterion should be whether a reasonable person, having knowledge of relevant facts and taking into account the conduct of the member and the member’s behavior under the circumstances, could conclude that the member has placed himself in a position where his objectivity would or could be impaired.”Multinational Comparative StudyThe European Union has introduced caps on fees from Non-Auditing services to Public Interest Entities (PIEs) as well as a disclosure obligation on the total fees received from PIEs. PIEs are defined as listed companies, credit institutions and insurance undertakings. Member States can also designate as PIEs, other undertakings that are of considerable public relevance, because of the nature and the size of their business or the number of their employees. The international practice (Australia, United Kingdom) shows prohibition on Non-Audit services like taxation, restructuring and valuation since they are likely to influence the objectivity and independence of Auditors.Consequently, India adopted a similar approach by prohibiting Auditors from performing specific Non-Audit services in the Companies Act, 2013. This prohibition is applicable to the audit firm, its associated entity or any entity whatsoever, in which the firm has significant influence or control or whose brand name is used by such audit firm or its partners. While Section 144 of the Companies Act, 2013 provides a list of prohibited Non-Audit services, it also authorizes the government to prescribe any other kind of services in this list.It has been noted that there could be a risk of self-review if certain services are allowed to be provided by the Auditor. Therefore, there is a need to review the list keeping in mind the various kinds of services rendered by Auditors which can possibly result in conflict of interest and threat to the independence.Presently, there is a cap which requires that Non-Audit services fee earned by statutory Auditor along with its associate concern or corporate bodies must not exceed the aggregate statutory audit fee. However, this cap was set in 2002 by ICAI and since then the market of Non-Audit services has evolved. Therefore, this cap on Non-Audit services also needs to be reviewed.It is recommended that a statutory Auditor must separately disclose to National Financial Reporting Authority (NFRA), the audit as well as Non-Audit fees earned from each of its Auditee Company or its holding or subsidiary companies.Under Section 144 of the Companies Act, 2013, an Auditor has to obtain prior approval of the audit committee or board of the directors for providing Non-Audit services which are specifically not prohibited. Similar approvals are required in other jurisdictions also. For instance, in U.S.A. under the Sarbanes Oxley Act, 2002, audit committee approves the types of Non-Audit services which can be provided to the Auditee Company. Similar practice is also followed in United Kingdom under the UK Corporate Governance Code, 2016. Therefore, keeping in view the best international practices, it is recommended that the approval of audit committee or board of directors given to Auditors to provide Non-Audit services, should be separately disclosed in the annual report of the Auditee Company along with a description of the necessary safeguards in place to protect the independence and objectivity of the Auditors.To get higher quality of audits, Auditors’ exclusive focus should be on audit and not on selling consulting services. This can be best achieved by the split up between audit and Non-Audit businesses into separate operating entities. As the proportion of Non-Audit services increases and the nature of the services provided by the Audit firms become further removed from the core audit function, so we need to increase the undermining focus on independent, high-quality audit. Also, THE BIG FOUR AUDIT FIRMS are conducting more than 50% of the audits in the World. Such a gap between the Big Four and the rest is not healthy, and will persist unless tackled. And choice could get worse rather than better if left unaddressed; choice would be severely further curtailed if one of the Big Four were to cease to operate.Competition and Regulation should work hand in hand to ensure that audit firms and individuals within those audit firms have the maximum incentives to carry out high-quality audits. Within firms, individual Auditors’ personal success should depend to a very large extent on whether they deliver high-quality audits. There must be set standards to review firms’ work and Auditors must be punished for sub-standard quality.Adv. Navin Kumar Jaggi (Life Member, Supreme Court Bar Association)Aashna Suri"

    "data": "On 19 July 2019, lawyers Menaka Guruswamy and Arundhati Katju acclaimed their relationship as a couple. They came out together after the historical judgment of Supreme Court in 2018 decriminalized Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code. Menaka Guruswamy is a lawyer by profession. She is a Rhodes Scholar who has an LLM degree from Harvard Law School as well as a D.Phil from Oxford University. She is also a visiting faculty at several prestigious schools like Columbia Law School, Yale Law School, and New York School of Law. Arundhati Katju is also a lawyer by profession and a James Kent Scholar. She holds an LLM degree from Columbia.Section 377 of IPC states “unnatural offenses” introduced by the British Rulers in 1862 which reads as: Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman or animal shall be punished with imprisonment for life, or with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be liable to fine.Section 377 criminalized homosexuality till 2018 but after the verdict of the Supreme Court, the scenario has changed. The verdict of the SC on 6th September 2018 decriminalized Section 377 and allowed gay sex amongst adult in private. The Supreme Court also stated that adult gay sex is not a crime and it is a sexual orientation which is natural and people have no control over it.On 19th July 2019, in an interview with CNN’s Fareed Zakaria, they both admitted their relationship. They also stated that the victory was not just professional one but also a personal one.When Zakaria asked about the judgment, Katju said that when Section 377 was finally repealed the things that happened after the judgment was kind of celebration for them and their parents, who had come down to the court to watch her and Guruswamy. Guruswamy said that the 2013 loss was a loss as lawyers, as citizens and also a personal loss. Guruswamy contended that it felt bad to be a criminal who had to go back to a Court as a lawyer to argue other cases.Guruswamy and Katju had also argued the matter in the Court in 2013 when the SC had held Section 377 of IPC as criminalized. Katju said that it was difficult to digest that gay people were considered second class citizens in the Court where they were practicing as lawyers. Guruswamy and Katju acclaimed their relationship as a couple after the verdict of SC on 6th September 2018. They were also named as one of the 100 most influential people of 2019 by TIME magazine. The lawyers are not the first who come about their sexual orientation this year. Recently Indian sprinter and national champion in the women’s 100 meters event, Dutee Chand also came in front of the world as a gay, becoming India’s first openly queer female athlete. Section 377 of the IPC verdict has given equal status to gays and LGBTQ community. Everyone has Right to Equality and is never to be judged on the basis of sexual orientation.The couple hopes that the verdict of 2018 brings changes in India and in other countries that are anti-gay.Chikita Malhotra"

    "headline": "Justice On Sale: The hefty court feesEVOLUTION OF INDIAN LAW IN THE ERA OF DIGITALIZATIONSupreme Court Judge in TroubleAre Pulses Food Grains? Answers Delhi High Court",
    "data": "Today, we will discuss something that isn’t discussed often whenever we talk about the Indian Legal System. It is the heavy court fees we pay in order to get justice. The court fee was introduced in 18th Century for the first time in presidency towns: Madras, Bengal and Bombay. The intention behind charging such fees is to deter litigants from approaching the courts. By 1870, it was seen that the scheme had succeeded in achieving the desired result. In post-independence period, there were some changes. By the incorporation of the seventh schedule in the constitution, the powers to impose tax and fees had been divided between the states and the union. However, this point should be given a little extra attention that we had freed ourselves from the shackles of the tyrannical British rule, but not from the tyrannical laws. Nothing changed, the people still paid to get privilege of being of heard. The only change was that the justification of imposing the fee had changed from deterring the litigants, to backing up the justice administration. The fee collection would go to the consolidated fund of the state. There were various factors of determining the fee; generally, it is determined by the amount of relief asked for or the immovable property involved in the litigation. So, if a person wants to repudiate a contract or want to evict a trespasser from his land, or any sort of legal dispute, then he would have to pay from 3 to 10 of the value of the suit. In any such suit of private nature, the ultimate concern of the court is to reinstate the litigant to its earlier stage. It ensures that the litigant merely recovers his loss, and get no scope to gain profit out of the litigation. However, the courts don’t consider the court fee as loss, which the litigant wouldn’t have borne if there is no suit. No doubt, the question would spring up in your mind that then who would pay the court fee if not us? Questions similar to that was raised by the 14th Law Commission of India and found out that the court fee from civil litigation brought enough funds to clear the expenses incurred in criminal litigation and salaries of judicial staff. In case, if the court fees weren’t enough to bear the expenses of civil litigation itself, still doesn’t it that courts provide services to the criminal litigants or the people approaching the High Court to safeguard their fundamental rights? So, as opined by the Law Commission that the fee should be in the proportion to the services rendered. The Supreme Court has also showed its concern on the same matter. In 1980, Justice Krishna Iyer observed that court fees are imposed on “such a profiteering scale without correlative expenditure on the administration of civil justice that the levies often smack of sale of justice in the Indian Republic.”. Since then, the courts have become cautious on this matter. The situation demands reconsideration, as justice is one of the essential parts of a human life. The state cannot do business of providing justice. By:-Adhiraj Joshi"

    "data": "The National Eligibility cum Entrance Test (generally known as NEET) released the answer key to the NEET-2019 recently. Through this answer key, an all India merit list has to be prepared for the admission of the candidates to the MBBS or BDS courses in various colleges and universities throughout the country. However a petition was recently filed by some NEET aspirants claiming that the answers of five questions in the answer key released by NTA (National Testing Agency) were wrong and the entire paper had to be quashed. This petition was filed by four students based in Hyderabad, India viz. Kayathi Mohan Reddy and three others through advocate Mahfooz Nazki. As a matter of fact, they said that the National Testing Agency (NTA) which conducted the exam issued wrong answer keys for certain questions and therefore had put at risk the career prospects and projections of the contenders who sat for this exam. About the petition, verbatim they said[1], “Pertinently, no option was given to the candidates to file any objections. To the shock and chagrin of the petitioners, not only did the key continue to have errors, some answers that had been correctly notified earlier stood changed to a wrong answer”.Dr. Abhishek Manu Singhvi who was the senior legal counsel appearing for the petitioners in the court of Law, submitted that the answer key circulated by the National Testing Agency for the NEET exam held on May 5 had quite a few errors. He said the five of the questions having four marks each had more than one correct answer or had an answer which was different from the answer key issued by the NTA. Dr. Singhvi also said that the career of the students will be affected if the mistakes were not rectified and also advocated that a proficient body should be instituted which shall be looking upon the correct answers as the counselling is yet to start from June 19.The Supreme Court thus on Thursday, agreed to hear this plea of the medical aspirants and a vacation bench comprising of Justice Indira Banerjee and Justice Ajay Rastogi decided upon hearing the plea filed by four students who appeared for the exam.However declining to regale this petition filed by these medical aspirants, challenging the NEET(UG)- 2019 answer key, the vacation bench of the Supreme Court said that it was even more apposite if the petitioners approached the High Court for reprieve. The bench of Justice Ajay Rastogi and Surya Kant legitimated and permitted the petitioners to pull out the petition with permission to avail different remedies. This was after the bench learnt that a new petition filed by a group of students from Kolkata in Delhi High Court was listed on Monday. The honourable bench said in this regard that the NTA had brushed up the answer key based on representations from the students, and hence there seemed to be no ‘mala-fide’ practices going on. “All multiple choice answers cannot be scrutinized by this court. We are not experts. We think somewhere some line needs to be drawn,” the bench said verbatim.By :-Shreya Saxena[1]"

    "data": "Since a long time immemorial, India has been a bouquet of many rituals. Blooming with its diversities, there were many things still left to be worked upon. From a significant time the authorities have been working on uplifting the women section of the society and trying their best to secure the rights they have. Like everything, this so called section of women has been sub divided for the purpose of laws, into- married, unmarried, daughter, working woman, etc. But what went unnoticed were the widows. The Indian society has been harsh when it comes to widows. From the ritual of sati to depriving them the rights of human ( family, festivals, colours,etc.). In its most talked, landmark judgment, Justice Chandrachud and Justice Gupta of SupremeCourt held that in case, widow of a Hindu Undivided Family, the brother-in-law will be responsible to maintain her. The court relied upon section 2(q) of The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005, stating that the relief can be sought against also be sought against the relatives of the husband.“An aggrieved wife or a female living in a relationship in the nature of marriage may also file a complaint against a relative of the husband or the male partner, as the case may be”, Justice Chandrachud observed in the judgment.Various other statutes are there to ensure the rights of the widows. The Hindu Succession Act of 1956 states that widows are eligible to claim right over the deceased husband’s property. This ensures her security of status and in monetary aspects after her husband’s death.Statutes like The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act of 1956 casts an obligation on father-in-law to maintain her out of earning or property, if she is not able to maintain herself out of her earnings or her or her deceased husband’s property. It further defines a “widow” as a “dependent”. She is considered dependent until she gets remarried.Further section 125 of The Code of Criminal Procedure of 1973 also talks about right of maintenance, although not specifically about that of widows. The quantum of maintenance is upon the discretion of the court. However, the amount is supposed to be adequate, and for the same purpose different section exist which determine the ground which should be taken into consideration. by :-Shruti dhar"

The family of the deceased alleged an intern doctor of negligence and they beat him which severely injured him. Later that night, when the family of the deceased came to take his dead body, the other interns demanded an apology from them for beating him. Which resulted in a fight between the interns and the family of the deceased. The two interns, Paribaha Mukhopadhaya and Yash Tekwani, got injured in this clash. From Tuesday morning, the doctors have been protesting to demand safety in workplace and punishment for the accused. Other major hospitals of the state joined in the protest i.e. National Institute of Homeopathy and SSKM etc. Moreover, the Outdoor Patient Department services have been stopped since Tuesday. Indian Medical Council (IMA) had lent their support to the agitation. Later, the other Health Institutions like All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS), Safdarjung Hospital, Dr Ram Manohar Lohia Hospital and United Resident and Doctors Association of India (URDAI) etc. also showed their support by putting white bandages on their forehead and gathering up in common areas of the hospitals. The doctors in other states like Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Odisha, Chhattisgarh and Goa, has shown the unitedness with their counterpart in the West Bengal. The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mamata Banerjee, gave four hours to the junior doctors to end the protest or be ready to evict the hostels. She called the junior doctors as “outsiders”. Also, she said that this is a conspiracy by BJP and CPI. In reply to this irrational behaviour, the doctors protested with ‘shame-shame’ and ‘we want justice’ slogans. On being threatened by the Chief Minister, 108 doctors of NRS Medical College gave their resignation and the number of resignations has been growing up across India. The chief minister later took a softer approach by contacting senior doctors to call off the protest.As a result, the doctors put up six conditions to stop the protest, one of them includes an apology from the Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee for her remarks against doctors. On the other hand, counter-Protest has been seen in some areas of the state by the patients who needed immediate help but didn’t get on time. One such place is Medinipur, where the families of the patients burst out in the Medical College. It is doubtless that the protest is a detriment to better treatment. If there is anybody who is at loss, then it is patients, and doctors as well. The growing agitation shows the inability of the government in dealing with the problem. Which has caused the Calcutta High Court to step in the matter and to direct the State government to negotiate an amicable solution in order to end the protest. by :-Adhiraj Joshi"

    "data": "On 11th June 2019, the Supreme Court exercised its special powers to direct the “immediate release” a journalist arrested by Uttar Pradesh police for objectionable tweets against Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath, saying an individual liberty was non- negotiable guarantee under the Constitution. He was arrested in Delhi on 8th June 2019. Kanojia has been charged with offences under section 500(defamation) and section 505(Statements conducing to public mischief) of the Indian Penal Code as well as section 67(publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) of Information Technology Act.The petition claims that Kanojia was picked up from his residence by people in plain clothes and no arrest was provided. The Uttar Pradesh police, according to the petitioner, did not seek transit remand from any court in Delhi before making the formal arrest.The matter was mentioned before the vacation bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Ajay Rastogi. The bench observed that- Prashant probably should not have published or written the tweets, but on what basis was he arrested. It also asked UP government to show document related to his release order. The lawyer arguing on behalf of state plea that the tweets was inflammatory; very, very strong and inflammatory tweet were made by accused, which has infringed on somebody’s right, but the court rebutted that it cannot be justified by putting a person behind the bars. The court advised that the petitioner should turn down and approach the lower court or high court for bail.On 11th June 2019, according to the press note issued by the Uttar Pradesh police acted on Suo Motu in the case. Kanojia’s wife challenged the arrest and has now moved the Supreme Court seeking issuance of the writ of Habeas Corpus. Additional Solicitor General (ASG) Vikramjit Banerjee and Advocate. Swarupama Chaturvedi, appearing for the Uttar Pradesh government, said a habeas corpus plea cannot be entertained as the accused is in judicial custody.ASG argued that a remand order was passed by the judicial magistrate and the petitioner should first approach the Allahabad High Court and he also said the plea was not maintainable and the apex court does not entertain writ petition unless High Court has first been approach.The bench said that the law is very clear.

    "data": "This incident popularly known as the ‘Kathua Rape Case’ where a nomadic minor girl was kidnapped on January 10, 2018, and allegedly gang raped in captivity in a small village temple in Kathua district of the state of Jammu and Kashmir after being kept sedated for four days was followed by a massive nationwide outrage. The mutilated body of this 8 year old victim was found in a nearby forest approximately a week later. It is equally crucial to know the reason behind this hideous and terrible delinquency. The abduction, rape and murder of the itinerant girl child were part of a carefully planned and premeditated strategy to remove the minority nomadic community from the area around Kathua, as the charge sheet filed by the Jammu and Kashmir Police stated. The case sparked outrage across the entire state, obliging the government to hand over the case to the Crime Branch of Jammu and Kashmir Police.Seven people were accused following this gruesome incident. The accused included former revenue official Sanji Ram, his son Vishal, Special Police Officers Deepak Khajuria and Surender Verma, two investigating officers — head constable Tilak Raj and sub-inspector Anand Dutta and a civilian, Parvesh Kumar as per the report put out by India Today recently. As the events unfolded in this regard, a special court in Pathankot recently held 6 of these seven accused as convicted. Sanji Ram, who was the head of the village and the caretaker of the temple where the minor girl was gang raped, the special police officer Deepak Khajuria and the civilian Parvesh Kumar – all three have been sentenced to life imprisonment of a term of 25 years. The other three accused – Tilak Raj, Anand Dutta and Surender Verma were sentenced to a term of five years of imprisonment for destroying certain evidences which were essential for the case.However, the special Court acquitted Vishal who was the son of Sanji Ram because of lack of evidence. Not to evade the mention of an eighth accused in this case who was a Juvenile. He will be tried in the Juvenile Court but there has been a delay presently because of the pending status of a petition in the Jammu and Kashmir High Court regarding the determination of the age of this Juvenile. This conviction was welcomed by many of the elite from the ‘who’s who’. As is noticeable, the Former chief minister of the state of Jammu and Kashmir, Omar Abdullah welcomed this judgement along with Mehbooba Mufti and many others. However it can be noticed that certain people found this Judgement to be flawed as the seventh accused was let go because of a doubt created before the Court because of the Lack of evidences. This included the workers of BJP in Jammu and Kashmir and also the victim’s Father who said that he is willing to challenge this acquittal in an appropriate court. The future thus holds the answers to this acquittal and its status.-Shreya SaxenaBanasthali Vidyapith"

    "data": " In the year 2006, construction of the disputed building started in the Maradu arear after receiving due permission of gram panchayat (now upgraded to municipality by the Government). The issue arose when it was said that the said building violated the CRZ (Costal Regulation Zone) notification by KCZMA (Kerala Coastal Zone Management Authority). A show cause notice was issued by the gram panchyat based on the notice of the Government stating violation of CRZ notification, which was later challenged in Kerala High Court. The construction continued based on an interim order’s of the Court and the notice was stayed. Further writ petition stating that the government lacked the power according to law to issue orders to local self-governing bodies, by the builders was withheld. This petition was challenged by the KCZMA in the Supreme Court, to which orders were passed on May 8. The builders argued before the court that proper permission was taken for the construction about which KCZMA was aware of. The construction is legal now taking into consideration that the area is categorized as CRZ-II, area which is permissible for construction as per the Coastal Zone Management plan prepared under 2011 CRZ notification. It is said the plan was approved by the Union Ministry of Environment and Forests about which the bench was not told off. The bench was constituted b Arun Mishra and Navin Sinha, who passed the orders based on the report given by a three member committee appointed by the court. The report stated that the construction was no legal as at the time of the construction the area came under CRZ-III which is not fit for construction. It was also noted that the permission by the panchayat was given without concurrence of Coastal Zone Management Authority. The bench stated that for them the main issue was whether the construction was legal at that time or not? And not whether it is legal now? It was further argued that the KCZMA is not allowed to object now as it did not raise any objection during the construction. The bench also stated that the decision about demolition, has been taken after keeping in mind the nature of flood prone area as per last year, and has directed to enforce the order within one month. Upon hearing this families residing in around 400 flats in five buildings knocked the doors of the court stating that they have the right to be heard. To this writ petition, the bench of Justice Indira Banerjee and Ajay Rastogi of vacation bench passed an order that the Court before ordering demolition did not give these families the right to be heard. As a result the bench said that it would be inappropriate for them to decide over the case of other bench, hence they passed an order of status quo for next six weeks (till the court re-opens). The matter was directed for listing in the first week of July before the respective bench. by :-shruti dhar"

Given the devastating effect violence has on women, efforts have mainly focused on responses and services for survivors.However, the best way to end violence against women and girls is to prevent it from happening in the first place by addressing its root and structural causes. A woman should be strong so that her daughter will have a role model and her son will know how to treat a woman by being a gentleman.The prevention should start in an early life, by educating and working with young boys and girls promoting respectful relationships and gender equality. Working with youth is a “best bet” for faster, sustained progress on preventing and eradicating gender-based violence. While public policies and interventions often overlook this stage of life, it is a critical era when values and norms around gender equality are forged.Women’s are strong always; they don’t need to sit around and feel sorry for themselves, nor let the society mistreat them. Women just don’t need to respond people who mistreat or disobey them or try to bring them down. A woman should know how to rise up stronger when they fall as women’s are not the victims, they are the survivors.An education curriculum should be formed to engage young people to make efforts to prevent and end discrimination against girls and women. The world needs strong women. Women who can build others, who will love and be loved, who will live bravely, both tender and fierce. Women of an indomitable will is all our society needs.It is true that the progress in terms of gender equality is uneven, but we need to understand that women are strong. They are forged through challenges of life, with each challenge they grow mentally and emotionally. Women move forward with their head held high and a strength that can never be denied.

    "data": "The lady made several attemptsTo escape and rage,Unfortunately all in vain,He was too savage.Insulted she stood naked,Searching something she couldn’t drape,She was another victim of marital rape.Rape is an unlawful sex without the assent of a man as of physical drive or due to deceitful demonstration of perpetuator. In India, rape by an outsider is considered as a penal offence under section 375 and 376 of Indian Penal Code.Shockingly, it avoids marital rape from ambit of conviction. Marital rape is sex done by spouse with his better half without her consent or by compel or danger.Hereby, rape is not only savagery against females but rather a grave infringement of a person’s basic ideal to life and personal freedom aswell.It isn’t right to trust that sex with spouse is husband’s privilege given to him by marriage. Marital rape is not an offense in India. Enactments in regards to marital rape in India either doesn’t exist or are esoteric and dependant on the understandings of courts.Similarly, section 375 of the IPC, mentions as its exceptional clause “sexual intercourse by man with his own wife, the wife not being under 15 years of age, is not rape.”Hence, marital rape is considered as a rape only if the spouse is less than 15 year age. There is no lawful security given to spouse after the age of 15 which is against the human rights directions.Marital rape is a wrongdoing against the females and deserving of government consideration. Women’s who are raped by their spouse are more inclined to various attacks and frequently endure ling haul physical and enthusiastic issues.According to this, marital rape is very disturbing for females she needs to remain with her aggressor. The results of marital rape are truly high, there is an extreme requirement to criminalize this offense.Therefore, the criminalization of marital rape will bring a change in society as well as in the attitude about ladies in marriage.“Her friends used to tell her it wasn’t rape if the man was your husband.

    "data": "Censorship is the process of filtering the content for the mass. It can be done by any private or public organisation, individual or body of individuals. The burning topic is as to whether online visual apps like Netflix, amazon prime videos, hotstar, etc. should be bought under the umbrella of censorship board or not?Many say that the contents shown on it should be sensibly scrutinized before uploading it. It all started with the advent of time and popularisation of these applications. These apps are preferred over the other sources like T.V.s, movies, radios, etc. as these are more convenient. These apps are said to be exposing our youth to nudity, sexual content, violence and other impactful contents. The question arising here is as to what is the extent of such influence? Are there no other platforms or sources, so to say which have such contents? Who and how will the content be censored?It needs to be kept in mind that there are many sources, beyond our limits to which the youth has already been introduced. So, to say that these are the only sources that need to be covered is wrong. Yes, we do accept the content on this platform are influential and need to be wisely put forth. There has not been, so far any content which can be said to be objectionable. Still the question exists as to what is considered as objectionable content? It is a completely subjective concept and depends on individual to individual. Hence, the reasonability needs to be first penned down. Another point that should be kept in mind is that a human works on reverse psychology. The restrictions put on them make them do the work which has been prohibited. This means leading to cybercrimes here, in search of the censored content. In my opinion, censorship is not required here. The board which might get set up will also include individuals with their own personal views. It is impossible to remove personal opinion and emotions from any statement or judgement. Scrutiny of the content is required indeed. For this we can have rules set up, with unambiguous language,which needs to be followed and have the apps censor content according to these rules by them.By Shruti Dhar"

    "data": "Madras High Court order which directed the prohibition on downloading the TikTok Mobile Application has been assailed before the Supreme Court. A special leave petition has been filed up by the Bytedance (India) Technology Pvt. Ltd., which owns the mobile application against the Madurai bench order directing the government to ban the application.However, the CJI headed bench refused the urgent listening of the petition. The matter was mentioned by the Senior Advocate Abhishekh Manu Singhvi.The bench therefore said that the plea will come up for hearing in due course of time.India Bans TikTok; HC said TikTok is Polluting YoungstersTikTok is a simple app, wherein users can lip-sync popular videos as well as can create short funny clips. These can be Bollywood songs, comedy acts, song videos, or general dialogues. More than 100 million Indians have downloaded the app and there are between 30–40 million active users in India.Madras High Court bans TikTokTikTok app has been banned by the Madras High Court based on a petition by Muthu Kumar, a Madurai based senior lawyer.The Bench at the Madras Court ruled: “By becoming addicted to TikTok App and similar Apps or cyber games, the future of the youngsters and mindset of the children are spoiled”.Similarly, media has also been banned from using any TikTok videos for any purpose.The Court directed Centre to make sure that no one is able to download TikTok app in India.Here are the three main reasons behind banning TikTok:-Violation of Section 79 of the IT ActThe Section 79 of the Information Technology Act in India provides protection to online mediums and platforms from lawsuits and defamation. For example, Facebook or Whatsapp owners and managers cannot be held accountable for any content or message posted on their platform. Hence, by this logic, banning TikTok in India due to the content shared on the platform is completely illogical and illegal. TikTok, as an online platform, can challenge this order as well.The ban is discriminatoryHere, as per the rule passed by the madras high court, only downloading of TikTok has been banned.Whereas, those users who have already installed the app can use it, as they please. Only the new users are banned. One can say that it is a pure discrimination between existing and new users.Similarly, this ban is also discriminatory against Google and Apple, which provide a platform for users to download these apps. First of all, there are no laws in India which can prevent Google and Apple and any other mobile apps platform from allowing TikTok for Indian users. Cutting off the freedom of expressionBasically the app empowers users to express themselves, via videos and lip-syncing and acting. It’s a platform for expression, and what we see is modern art. This art can be disturbing at time, as the basic nature, the very process of creating art is a disruption. But here, due to a single-minded view of few Judges, this amazing platform to express oneself has been banned. This is unfair for both the active users of TikTok, and for those who used the platform to express themselves. In the year 2015, a bench of Justices J. Chelameswar and R.F. Nariman in the Supreme Court had scrapped Section 66A, as it violated Freedom of Expression. Previously, this draconian act was used to arrest and intimidate anyone, who said something wrong/bad online, which was termed as offensive.While abolishing this act, the bench had said, “what is grossly offensive to you, may not be grossly offensive to me and it is a vague term.. Highly trained judicial minds (judges of the UK courts) came to different conclusions by using the same test applied to judge as to what is grossly offensive and what is offensive,”Issue of children’s safetyKids performing on the platform stand a chance to get exploited and bullied on the platform, and this has actually happened.Not only kids, but adult’s as well.A 24-year old man killed himself after he was bullied and insulted on TikTok. Similarly, such bullying can happen anywhere, even on Facebook or any public park.While performing stunts for higher views, few kids killed themselves on the road, and such incidents have come to light.As it happened with TikTok in the US, TikTok created a separate app for kids, and infused additional safety measures and protocols to ensure that no kid is harassed, or abused on the platform. After TikTok met the regulations imposed by US Federal Trade Commission, and everything is fine there now. The Content has been segregated based on audience profile and many filters and checks have been imposed. Parents have been educated on how to monitor the content accessed by their kids, and provided with more tools and features to do that.Hence, instead of a ban, there is no reason why the same cannot be applied to India as well.ByRiya Mishra"

Creating fake accounts is something which is against the law as well as is offensive in nature. It leads to harassment.Similarly, fake accounts can spread spam and viruses to steal your private data. These fake accounts are made up by the offender’s maybe to take some kind of revenge and upload malicious pictures. These offenders may steal your identity to make their accounts.It is must to have a look at the legality and the punishments for creating such fake profiles as you can file a complaint in such situations.Creating a fake account of another personCheating of a person is necessary. There must be a pecuniary profit to the person who is creating a fake account of another person.Therefore, through IP address, the real face which is behind all this can be traced.Hereby, Section 66-D of Information Technology Act 2000, which was amended subsequently in 2008, states that “whoever by means of any communication device or computer resource cheats by personating, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine which may extend to one lakh rupees.”How can you file a complaint?The complaint can be filed by the victim before the Adjudicating officer who is appointed under the Information Technology Act.

    "data": "The case of K.M. Nanavati vs. State of Maharashtra has been one of the landmark judgments in the post Independence India. It is unique in its own nature, because it was the last case to be heard by a jury trial in India. The case has always been the subject of much discussion, in the legal fraternity as well as in the media. It has also been immortalized on the celluloid as the movie Rustom starring Akshay Kumar, Ileana D’Cruz in lead roles. The case also involved a celebrated jurist and acclaimed criminal lawyer from the side of prosecution, namely Ram Jethmalani.The facts of the case are as follows:Kawas Manekshaw Nanavati, a commander in the Indian Navy, and second in command of the naval ship Mysore, lived with his English born wife Sylvia, in Mumbai. Nanavati was frequently away on official assignments, and in the meantime, his wife, Sylvia had fallen in love with Prem Ahuja, an automobiles businessman and a family friend of the Nanavatis. On the first of November, Nanavati returned home from one of his assignments and finding Sylvia aloof and distant, he questioned her. Sylvia, who now doubted Prem’s intention to marry her, confessed about the affair to her husband. Nanavati was beside himself, and even expressed his desire to kill himself. Afterwards, Nanavati quietly dropped his family at the Metro Cinema, for a show he had promised to take them to, but excused himself and headed straight to the naval armory. Under the pretext of “Self Protection”, he signed out a gun with six cartridges in a brown envelope.Nanavati then drove to the Universal Motors Office on Pedder Road and asked for Prem Ahuja. He already left, he was told. Nanavati did not take the gun with him when he went in and looked around for Ahuja in the showroom. Then Nanavati drove to Ahuja’s home, and confronted him about his wife’s paramour with him. In the heat of the moment, Nanavati, an expert marksman, fired three shots at Prem Ahuja as what has been aptly described by the Blitz, as three shots that shook the nation. Subsequently, he went to the Provost Marshal of the Western Naval Command and confessed his crime, and on his advice, confessed and surrendered to the Deputy Commissioner of Police, John Lobo.Subsequent proceedings and its outcome: The case was tried by a nine member jury, consisting of 2 Parsis, 2 Christians and 5 Hindus at the Greater Bombay Sessions Court. On the basis of the evidence presented, and witness testimonies, which surprisingly included Sylvia as a witness for Nanavati, the jury returned a verdict of 8-1 not guilty under section 302 of Indian Penal Code. However, the sessions judge R.B. Mehta referred the case to the Bombay High court on the grounds that the acquittal was perverse, since the jury was heavily influenced by the media.The crux of the case was whether Nanavati shot Ahuja in the “heat of the moment” or whether it was a premeditated murder. If it were a crime of passion that took place almost instantaneously, Nanavati would not have been charged under the Indian Penal Code for culpable homicide amounting to murder. This is because he could have invoked exceptions 1 and 4 of section 300 of IPC (which defines murder). However in case of a premeditated murder, he would be liable for culpable homicide amounting to murder. The Bombay High Court took into account various facts presented, such as Nanavati’s correction of the misspelling of his name in the police record after his confession. The High Court agreed with prosecution’s side that the murder was indeed premeditated and hence, sentenced Nanavati to life imprisonment for culpable homicide amounting to murder. The Supreme Court, on further appeal, upheld the High Court’s verdict. However, Nanavati was pardoned by the then Governor of Bombay, Vijaylakshmi Pandit.To conclude, the dramatic, large- than-life case of K.M.Nanavati is undoubtedly one of the most famous trials in India, and had equally impactful imprint on the judiciary. Even after 50 years, the Nanavati case continues to have a tremendous recall value among a public infamous for its short memory. The case involved three pivotal points: abolishment of the system of jury trials in India, reversal of verdict on the grounds that the jury had been influenced by media, and distinguishing between culpable homicide amounting to murder and culpable homicide not amounting to murder on the grounds of grave and sudden provocation. It remains a landmark case in criminal law, even today, due to the circumstances extraordinaire that arose in this case. "

    "headline": "Indian Sedition Law & its aspectsTablighi Jamaat, Do Foreigners have the right to return to their native land after contributing to sufferance?Ex Supreme Court Judge P.C. Ghose takes oath as the First LokpalIMPOSITION OF HINDI IN HARYANA COURTS",
    "data": "Section 124A in The Indian Penal Code, 1860 defines and explains sedition in a wide and magnanimous way. It says ‘whoever by words, either spoken or written, or by signs or by visible representation, or otherwise brings or attempts to excite disaffection towards the Government established by law in India shall be punished with life imprisonment. According to this section, comments expressing strong disapproval of the administrative or other action of the Government without exciting or attempting to excite hatred, contempt or disaffection do not constitute an offense under this section. Many Indian freedom fighters like Mahatma Gandhi and Bal Gangadhar Tilak were charged with sedition during the freedom struggle. When the first amendment was introduced, this also included detailed limitation on the freedom speech, the then Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru, was categorical in his belief that the offence of sedition was fundamentally unconstitutional. He had said that the sooner we get rid of this Section, the better it is for us since it is highly objectionable and obnoxious and thus has no place for practical and historical reasons. It was a recent notable case that happened in India in 2015 where the Delhi police arrested the president of The Jawaharlal Nehru University (JNU) Students’ Union, Kanhaiya Kumar on February 13th, following the protests in the JNU Campus against the hanging of the 2001 Parliament attack convict, Afzal Guru. The next development was that Kanhaiya Kumar was charged with sedition as per Section 124A of the Indian Penal Code.The main question arises whether Section 124A is constitutional or not and whether does it give an authority to the citizens of India for freedom of speech and expression.The right to freedom and expression of speech under Article 19(1)(a) is one of the essential foundations of the Indian Constitution or in a democratic country like India. Reasonable restrictions under Article 19(2) can only be imposed on certain grounds such as Security of the State, Contempt of court, defamation, public order, sovereignty and integrity of the State, etc. It is important to note that under the Indian law of sedition, events at the public meeting, even if completely true, do not even come close to establishing an offence. In Kedar Nath Singh’s case, the five-judge bench had held that not all words are seditious. Seditious speech and expression will be allegedly punished only if the speech is an incitement to violence and tranquility of public order. In Shreya Singhal vs. Union of India, this notion was raised too. The Supreme Court made a clear distinction between “advocacy” and “incitement” and held that only the latter could be punished.Therefore, advocating revolution or advocating even violent overthrow of the State does not amount to sedition, unless there is incitement to violence and more importantly the incitement is imminent violence towards a particular thing. In Balwant Singh vs. State of Punjab, The Supreme Court overturned the convictions for sedition (Section 124A IPC) and promoted enmity between grounds on grounds of religion, caste, etc. (Section 153A IPC) and acquitted persons who had shouted foul statements against the Hindus and Sikhs in Chandigarh. Thus words and speech can be criminalized and punished only in situations where it is being used to incite mobs or crowds to violent action. Mere words and phrases by themselves, no matter how distasteful do not always amount to a criminal offence. If that is the case, then the citizens of India would soon start losing their freedom of speech and expression. Anyone would put a sedition case against anyone on the basis of enmity or distasteful conversation amongst themselves.The question now stands as to whether we really need a sedition law. The most interesting part of Section 124A is its durability. The text is all for practical purposes, the same text that was used by the British people to put Gandhi behind bars. Our constitution makers and our legislators have made a disservice by keeping this section in our political lives, creating a much more havoc in the political field. One course of action which is futile to insist is to insist on a strict interpretation of Section 124A. The Supreme Court has interpreted its views through numerous case laws and has concluded that this section be applied only to actions that have a direct and unambiguous connection to violence or public disorder. But the question lies as do politicians really follow the approach of The Supreme Court? No, they don’t. Police authorities and politicians have a tendency to ignore these niceties in applying such laws. That is why it will be better to remove this legislation as a whole.

    "data": "One person’s liberty can be another person’s constraint because conditions in our charismatic society continue to change. Defamation stands that any imputation- written, spoken or otherwise – concerning an individual, which is intended to harm the reputation of said individual is said to be defamatory. Defamation laws are given in Indian penal code, 1860 and law of torts. Where as if we see the contradiction of this freedom of press although there is no provision guaranteeing the freedom of press because freedom of press is included in the wider form of expression which is guaranteed by Article 19 (1) (a) of Indian Constitution. Freedom of press (expression) means to express not only one’s own views but also the views of others by any medium or means.It is very disputable topic all over the country that we have freedom to speak or publish then why it becomes an offence and consider it defamatory. Freedom to press (freedom to speech and expression Article 19(1)(a) is not absolute but have certain reasonable restriction in the interests of the security of the state, sovereignty and integrity of India, friendly relations with foreign states, public order, decency or morality, or for the prevention of contempt of court, defamation or incitement to an offence.Defamation comes under restriction of freedom of speech. So as it is important to protect people from the harms that untrue statement may cause, it is also important to protect speaker so that they may speak freely without fear of reprisal. It means that they can speak or publish whatever they want to but there should be no untrue statement which harm the reputation of any person. People cannot be punished for speaking the truth, no matter how ugly it may be. Truth is always a defence to a claim of defamation.Freedom of press (expression) is regarded as one of the most important human rights and one of the basic conditions for the progress of a democratic society and for the development of every man. As we all know media plays a great role in everyone’s life people get to know more about people through press only rather it’s only a news or case on any big man or you can say any information relates any country or else whether it in a form of debate or to girl people by expressing their view point so that people can know and have their skill how it all works. Nothing is defamation if in press something is stated true or in good faith. The media is a gatekeeper and watching dog to us it watches what’s going in society or country it make us aware although its restricts to them they cannot harm any reputation in society but if they are revealing any truth they should not be stop by any political pressure or because of any money hunger. It acts as multifaceted institution with multiple activities. The freedom of press is a necessary concomitant of the freedom of expression that involves a right to receive and impart information without which democracy becomes an empty slogan. Freedom of press is necessary for the people to have a right of information or knowledge through the medium of press.There is recent case of Rahmat Fatima Amanullah she is a daughter of former Bihar minister Praveen Amanullah supreme court rejected the plea filed against Patna high court’s order quashing criminal defamation proceeding initiated by her against Rajdeep Sardesi and Raghav Bahl for allegedly defaming her by telecasting certain reports on Hindu news channel IBN7 in 2011 regarding her alleged involvement in a land allotment scam in the state.Supreme court dismissed the appeal and said that journalist should be allowed to exercise freedom of expression, it said that particular piece of wrong reporting should not be held against them forever.It shows that may be there is wrong reporting but they might not have intention to do that and they were not held under this sometimes its is on evidence and circumstance of the case that the person publishing something or speaking having intention to let down the reputation of another or not if he does something which is not intentionally he will not be held liable.At the end it concluded that there should be freedom of press which is not absolute but have reasonable restrictions which also include defamation. And which is not violating anyone’s right but maintain the peace and integrity of society. Sarika Vishnoi is a 2nd year BA LL.B student of Modi University, Sikar."

AmbedkarCaste is a huge hurdle and we may say that it is a permanent hurdle in the progress of our nation, and approx 29-30 years after the law to safeguard the scheduled caste and scheduled tribes came into existence, the Supreme Court diluted one of its provisions.The apex court issued a number of guidelines on 20 March, that would protect public servants and private individuals from arbitrary and instant arrest under the SC and ST (Prevention of Atrocities) Act. There was an advice given by the central government to the top court to recall the judgment.Perception of the Act The 1989 Act, which was revised in 2015, punished caste libel and refused anticipatory bail to the accused. Constructing the Act more demanding, the SC and ST Amendment Act,2015 adjoin the action like the shaving of the heads or a part of the body for religious rites such type of act are disparaging the dignity of fellows of Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes, now onward they were also treated as atrocities.“Notwithstanding diverse parameter to improve the social and economic condition of the SCs and STs, they stay unsafe (unprotected) they denied various civil rights.Supreme Court on 20, March 2018“Innocent citizens are termed accused, which is not intended by the legislature. The legislature never intended to use the atrocities Act as an instrument to blackmail or to wreak personal vengeance.”-SC JudgmentThe court was of the view that false complaints were filed against innocent people to promote caste hatred. It is important to express effects that working of the Atrocities Act should not amount to the result of perpetuating castes which can have a reverse effect on the merger of the society and the constitutional values.The court was hearing a petition filed by Subhash Mahajan, Maharashtra’s Director of Technical Education, who had confronted a Bombay High Court judgment. The High Court rejected a petition to quash the objection filed against Mahajan by Bhaskar Gaikwad, for consisting inverse entries in Gaikwad’s Annual Confidential Report. Gaikwad had contended that Mahajan was not allowed to deal with his concerned application as it could be meant to deal with the state government lonely.Altering the judgment, the Supreme Court said the advancing was a “clear abuse of process of court’’ and said that law is being misled for various decades since it came into existence.Decline to be with Gujarat High court orderEven after the unfavorable action of political parties and citizens, the Supreme Court in hearing a case declined to be with Gujarat High Court order giving bail to 2 builder accused of assaulting a Dalit man. The high court had granted anticipatory bail to them, relying on the Supreme Court’s order of 20th March.The panel of Chief Justice Dipak Mishra and Justices A.M. Khanvilkar & D.Y.

Statistics Analysis Alleging of “abuse of law” by the top court, official data poke at a weak execution of the Act instead of its misuse, low rate of conviction and high crimes against the SCs and STs. According to the National Crime Records Bureau, crimes against SCs has gone up by 5.5% in the year 2016.The figures which were 38,671 in 2015 has gone up to 40,801 in 2016. In case of Scheduled Tribes, the numbers indicate of 4.6% from 2015 to stand at 5579 in the year 2016. By analyzing the data shown under the Act, 1989, the charge sheet rate of 78%, and the conviction rate was only 15.6%.A renowned journalist who is known for his voices for Dalits ‘Dilip C Mandal’ said “these figures mean that the law is not implemented properly & investigating agencies don’t do their duties properly. The top court could direct the government to arrange the right execution of this law. But instead, the court decided to weaken the law itself.”Writer and social activist Kancha said “it is not easy for the lower caste to get justice on time because the ones at the top are also reluctant to the investigation scheduled caste and scheduled tribe cases efficiently.’’ Niharika Verma is a 2nd year BA LL.B student of Modi University, Sikar."

    "data": "Sumedha Ray, a 3rd-year law student from Symbiosis Law School (Pune), writes about patent rights in the light of recent technological advancements. Machine Learning is one of the current topics in the technological space and everyday some technological advancement is taking place. The number of algorithms and techniques in machine learning are increasing day by day with researchers and engineers working towards its implementation and benefits. Since this is increasing on a daily basis, the question of patenting machine learning has also come into picture. Be it a person, an organization or any team, who is in the discovery of such a process, the process of filing a patent is somewhat cumbersome and time consuming as it encompasses technical and legal perspectives as well. There can be many steps where one can go wrong while filing for a patent. Although, the number of patents in machine learning is observing a sudden rise among technology companies, the challenges in filing patents cannot be overlooked. This rises for a topic of debate whether with critics arguing and debating whether machine learning should be patented or not. Patents are intangible assets that are products of a unique idea or thinking which fall under the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR). In India, the patent filing process is a stringent one since it requires consent from the government authorities even though it promotes filing patents for startups.There are a lot of regulations; despite that Google has multiple patents for machine learning algorithms and methods such as Dropout, linear regression, etc. Since the functionalities of machine learning is a tad bit difficult, tech companies such as Google, Samsung, Amazon, etc. and many other investments in this field and make machine learning related technology much patent-friendly, which can benefit the general public as a whole rather than aim at commercial gain. With this motive in mind, these companies are developing newer software which has machine learning at a faster rate than ever.Businesses need safeguards to grow. Investors need to justify allocating capital to a business and for that, there have to be mechanisms to ensure the value created doesn’t leak out making it easy for others. Traditionally, the value used to be safeguarded by a lot of legal mechanisms but gradually software patents are becoming obsolete. In the business markets where products are scarcely differentiated from one another, branding becomes critical. The efforts given by each brand to advertise its products are protected by patents that provide the right to use it for a given purpose.Most of the patent filing process aims at avoiding conflicts. Critics argue that all patents, including machine learning discoveries, do not always focus on solving the problem on a large scale thus making the concept of patenting technologies obsolete. Thus it furthermore obviates the innovations of machine learning and either way it is not solving the problem. In 2017, the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) chose one machine learning algorithm patent developed by a food tech company in the United States to highlight where it could seriously affect innovation in machine learning. The patent is based on standard machine learning techniques that already exist and is simply an application of these techniques. Daniel Nazer, the EFF lawyer who brought out this patent to light says that the patent is just an application of machine learning in the company’s problem of interest and is not worth its weight due to its lack of innovation.There is another fear by the experts in this field. It is this fear about broad patents being issued in the AI space. For instance, Google’s patent on common machine learning technique called Dropout could mean that it could insist that no one can use this technique till they have a patent for it, which would like 20-30 years more. In another case, Microsoft has a patent application with some broad claims on active machine learning.In conclusion, it can be said that machine learning inventions and their patent filing attract the considerable amount of attention from respective governments citing legal and ethical issues. Experts suggest that the innovations focus on real value and address critical issues instead of just getting patents. Therefore, a lot of thought is to be put before anyone working on machine learning stumbles across a new idea or algorithm."

With the introduction of the Aadhar system, being more prevalent in the year 2017, it has become arduous to make people understand the significant changes that could be brought in this digital world. Privacy is a broad term which encompasses freedom of thought, control over information about oneself, protection of one’s reputation and protection of an individual’s dignity and integrity.The term ‘privacy’, simple as it may sound, but it is not easy to define as it covers a wide area. For an individual, ‘privacy’ can mean anything and it varies from person to person. Privacy is a legal right which cannot be altered by a court of law or the likes. In a historic judgment on August 24, 2017, a nine-judge Supreme Court bench unanimously ruled that privacy is a fundamental right guaranteed by the Constitution of India.[1] Basically, it would mean that the Supreme Court of India has appreciated the right to “private life”.In the year 2017, when the debate between privacy and security was going on, Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Law & Justice and Electronics & Information Technology said that the Government of India should ensure the security of every citizen’s data that is linked with the Aadhar Card; It is a great initiative and shouldn’t be disrupted due to lack of security. Owing to India’s not so strong hold over internet and internet technology, the data has a higher risk of being leaked or misused. The government should, however, keep in mind that Aadhar increases its responsibility towards every citizen’s life, and should take adequate measures regarding data security. The Aadhar Act was enacted bearing this thought, and very specifically states that citizen’s data cannot be revealed for any unscrupulous activity. It will only be released in case of national security and the highest shield of protection is given to all information.Recently, it had become mandatory to link Aadhar with all our personal accounts, including bank accounts and other accounts related to monetary transactions. People using payment apps like Paytm, Mobikwik, etc and cab services app like Ola, Uber, etc, were also required to link their accounts with Aadhar to ease online transactions. This guarantees that a person’s account cannot be used by any random person as. Slowly, everything is being planned to be linked with the Aadhar system, even driving licenses and online shopping sites. Linking driving licenses and motor vehicles with Aadhar will facilitate the system of tracking a drunken driver. Telecom companies have already been almost successful in linking mobile numbers to one’s Aadhar card. Pragmatic realities of digital age should be respected as the Government is trying to encourage digital transaction.Privacy and Security can never be on the same scale in terms of maintaining both. The Indian law system can rather try to strengthen our privacy laws instead of debating on the topic whether privacy is important or security holds a greater place. This is a debate where both privacy and security hold strong points to get dominated by each other. Both are equally important as per the Indian Constitution and the Indian government is still struggling as to which should be given more importance. The Aadhar system should be implemented on a wider scale, but on the other hand, the Indian population should also be assured of their privacy and security of the data by implementing strict laws.[1]Amit Anand Choudhary vs. Dhananjay Mahapatra"

    "data": "Putting a cap on the 20-year old case that began with a late night safari in the tourist city of Jodhpur in 1998, Chief Judicial Magistrate Dev Kumar Khatri pronounced a 201-page verdict against actor Salman Khan on April 6, 2018 (Thursday).The actor was booked under Section 51 of the Wildlife Protection Act and is set to serve a 5-year jail term and a fine of Rs 10,000; his co-actors were acquitted on account of non-identification by eyewitness Poonamchand Bishnoi. On granting probation to the actor, the verdict says, “It is not justified to give Salman Khan the benefit of probation in view of the manner in which he hunted by shooting two innocent, moot blackbucks that come under the purview of the Wildlife Protection Act.” The order was, however, deferred, with J. Ravinder Kumar Joshi asking for the records from previous cases judged by the rural and high court.The conviction came as a shock to Salman’s lawyers, who immediately applied for bail, hearing of which started at 10:52 AM today at the Jodphur Sessions Court. The bail order has been reserved until Saturday. Mahesh Bora, Salman’s lawyer, argued upon the unreliability of the witness statements. Additionally, he said that the circumstances relied upon by the trial court were already discarded by the Rajasthan High Court. “He is paying the price of his celebrity status”, says Bora, who filed a 51- page bail application against the judgment.In the jail, Salman is kept in Barrack No. 2, next to self-proclaimed godman Asaram Bapu. While the actor’s fans and the entire Bollywood fraternity spoke against the duration of the punishment, Khwaja Asif (Pakistan’s Foreign Minister) tried to play the religion card, saying that the actor was ‘sentenced because he’s a minority’.Even though animal rights activists across the country hailed the conviction, it will be interesting to see whether the actor, like in his previous cases, will be discharged of the allegations yet again.

Defending the West Bengal CM, Mamta Banerjee may be rude in speech but her intentions are good and she deserves to be the next Prime Minister.“When a person is a strict and wants to do their duty, there are people who will make false accusations and Mamta is innocent” he said.Both Congress and BJP governments have been deliberately apathetic to recovery of black money stashed in “Germany and other countries”, Mr Jethmalani said. “They have committed a joint crime of cheating people. Therefore, a third front of honest leaders is needed,” the former Union Law Minister said.The senior lawyer also criticised Finance Minister Arun Jaitley and the NDA government over their policy on black money. The NDA government has no right to stay in power, he said.“NDA government has no right to stay in power after 2019” he said.Eminent lawyer and RJD MP Ram Jethmalani on Sunday said he felt “guilty” and “cheated” for helping Prime Minister Narendra Modi who failed to deliver on his promise of bringing back blackmoney stashed abroad.He said, however, after becoming PM, Modi failed to bring back blackmoney and now it seems that the latter would not be able to fulfil his promise. “I feel cheated and consider myself guilty that I helped Modi.

    "data": "P.K. Sahi, the Ex Education Minister of Bihar and Member of the Executive Council of CNLU while interacting with the students said that they don’t care about the Termination of New Vice Chancellor or Discontinuation of Old Vice Chancellor or even if the University shuts down. Advocate Sahi was also part of the Selection Committee which recommended Bhat’s name for the position of Vice Chancellor.In a very despotic manner, the ex-minister asked for proofs of corruption against the new Vice Chancellor whereas he already had the information about the removal of Ishwar Bhat from the position of Vice Chancellor of NUJS, Kolkatta due to the pressure created by the students union. The review commission setup by CJI to look into the matters against Bhat is scheduled to submit its report on April 7 according to some sources.Students of Chanakya National Law University (CNLU) staged a silent protest against the appointment of Ishwara Bhat as the new vice-chancellor for the last three days in the campus.Students staged a protest outside the varsity main administrative building stating that Bhat has a tainted background and his appointment will bring bad name to the university. Bhat was the VC of West Bengal National University of Juridical Sciences (WBNUJS), Kolkata.On the recommendations of a search committee, the chancellor of the university, who is also the Chief Justice of Patna High Court, Justice Rajendra Menon, appointed Bhat as the VC of the university. Bhat is yet to resume office as the term of the present VC, A. Lakshminath expires on March 18.CNLU’s chancellor, Patna high court chief justice Rajendra Menon notified Bhat’s selection to the post three days back, choosing from three recommendations sent to him by a search committee comprising of former NLU Jodhpur VC (retd) Justice NN Mathur, Patna University VC Prof Nitin Karmalkar and senior advocate PK Sahi.. National Judicial Academy assistant director DP Verma and Delhi University professor Dr PK Bhatnagar were the other two recommendations for the Patna job.A third-year student of CNLU staging the agitation said: “We have come to know that the new VC has a tainted past. Bhat has faced two no-confidence petitions against him by the NUJS student body.” They said students of WBNUJS were against the VC for his alleged charges of financial embezzlement, curbing student liberties, declining quality in faculty and lack of transparency in administrative work.Echoing the views of the students, a fourth-year student said: “The search committee should have gone through the background of Bhat as his appointment will bring bad name for the varsity.”CNLU registrar S.P. Singh said: “The committee is probing charges against Bhat. Also, if the charges are proven he should not be appointed. But before the committee report comes out it is unfair to raise allegations against him. Bhat is highly qualified and is serving WBNUJS for two-terms.”Unlike state universities where a search committee goes through the applications of candidates applying for the VC’s post, at CNLU the search panel invites nominations from reputable persons or institutions in the field of law for the VC’s post.With Inputs fromTelegraphLegally India"

    "headline": "Women Trafficking: Modern Day SlaveryCOVID’S YET ANOTHER VICTIM: ORPHANSDO’S AND DON’TS WHILE ON AN INTERNSHIPCLAT RESULTS 2019",
    "data": "“We see faces but no identity, bodies without destiny. Cars slow down their pace, men look out their windows and gaze. Every night when a girl drives back home, crosses that road, where love is sold”.When we hear the word women trafficking, what comes our minds? Maybe a global issue, happening over there? Someone’s horrible problems but not ours? Or about any movie has taken? Or most fascinatedly, the crazy vade van that has been in fierce, that our children have been abducted into?What if I say, it is not a so-called international issue but it’s something which is hidden in the backyards of our own cities. What if I say, it is in our own cities, where we are, not safe and can be bought and sold any moment of time.What we have in our minds is that trafficking means girls are kidnapped and chained to beds. Yes, that’s understandable and this is because we craft our understanding based on the media representation. But let me make it very clear, that’s it is just a cinematic version and the reality is often different.By the definition, ‘trafficking’ means forced work. A victim is forced to do things against his/her will. Globally, 80% of women trafficking is related to sexual exploitation while the rest is bonded labour. And India is allegedly the hub of these crimes in Asia.Here’s a story of a young girl, Rebecca Blender, who survived women trafficking. She was born and raised in a small town, in southern Oregon, in a normal middle-class family. For higher studies, she got assigned to the state university and was very excited to move to the new place. But that summer, she got pregnant by her boyfriend. Knowing this pregnancy, her boyfriend left her on her own. She finally decided to have this baby and gave birth to a beautiful girl. It was at that time when she met a guy who pretended to have interest in her. She liked the way he treated her child and then they got along the way very well. When everything going well they decided to move to Las Vegas because his new boyfriend was working there. Then after few days, his boyfriend pulled her up to an escort service and told her that this is how it works in Vegas, had spent a lot of money to get her here and tells her to earn the money to pay back. She felt trapped. She was helpless with her baby. “When you have a trafficker, waiting at home, with your child and says if you don’t bring $1500, you are going to find your daughter out on the corner”, says Rebecca. She says that she was probably more frightened to go back home than was to be in the red room.It’s not just Rebecca Blender, but many girls across us who live in such darkness.So, the basic reason for this whole thing that I figured out is poverty and sexual abuse. It has been seen that poor girls who don’t find ways to get out of their poverty, ultimately find their way to the traffickers who would give them money for survival. Many vulnerable girls and women are lured by promises of employment and some parents are so desperate that they sell their daughters for some money. Also, sexual abuse is concerned to be the most talked reason. Yes, because when a girl is sexually abused, most of them break down, leave everything, home family and just run out in the world so deep and dark, homeless, confused and scared. Around 90% of these runaways are approached by traffickers to converse in sex industry. And do you know all that it takes are just few golden lines like, are you hungry? I bet you need a place to stay tonight and with that a little girl longing for a covering finally will go right into his predators arms where she will remain sold for sex.“She was just 16 when she went missing from her home town. She reached the city amidst slaughters. She never saw her family again. She was sold while still was a daughter. She lies down on the beds of tyrants, while she was still dressed as a bride”.Of course it’s preventable. There is some hope and researches have told that intervention at the ages of 8, 12 and 18 are most affective. We need to make ourselves and children aware of all this creepy World out there. Let’s try to bring about a change because we never know if we can be the one, amongst the other millions of girls.Break the silence and stop every nightmare that haunts a women.

    "headline": "JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY AND INDEPENDENCEVishakha guidelines: an enterprise to reduce workplace harassment of women.MINING SCAM: SUPRME COURT PERMITS EX- KARNATAKA MINISTER REDDY TO VISIT AILING FATHER-IN-LAW.﻿SEXUAL HARASSMENT",
    "data": " INTRODUCTION:There was once a time when it was thought that the major issues concerning a judiciary were matters of independence, tenure, the appointment process and the questions performing the integrity. These matters no doubt continue to obtain but no one can ignore these changes in emphasis that has taken place in recent times.The three organs of the Indian government – Legislature, Executive and Judiciary perform three essential functions of rule-making, rule application and rule adjudication respectively. The main principle behind this formulation is separation of powers: which brings accountability, keeps the government restrained and in this way our rights and liberties are safeguarded. In fact the main driving force behind this is based on the simple saying that ‘power corrupts man and absolute power corrupts absolutely’. But given the increase in the rate of corruption charges one can’t help but ask the question ‘who is judging the judges?’ There is another principle working together with the separation or balance of power i.e., checks and balances.The main argument which propends the current judicial system against the question of accountability is of the independence of judiciary. The independence of judiciary is another important concept which should be studied together with the concept of accountability. And since the judiciary is the public institutions, which is for the people, it should be accountable to the people. And work according to the provisions of the constitution, keeping an eye on the preamble which is the soul of the constitution.INDEPENDENCE OF JUDICIARY:Independence is a bulwark of rule of law. If law is to be applied equally to all citizens in the country, then it is equally important that the judges should be independent in applying law and rendering judicial decisions. So for giving a sound, lucid and unbiased decision umpires should be free from any kind pressure from litigants, cabinet ministers, influential personalities, big corporations, rich businessmen and also criminal elements of the society.Independence of judiciary is needed because:Independence of judiciary concept has however faced many criticisms and problems when it comes to appointment and transfer of judges. It is important that Judicial Independence and Judicial Accountability co-exist and go hand in hand in order to maintain harmony in the judicial system. Article 235 of the Indian Constitution gives power to the High Courts over subordinate courts, thus establishing a perfect example of judicial independence.The problem actually lies in the understanding of independence; it should be understood as independence from executive and legislature and not independence from accountability.JUDICIAL ACCOUNTABILITY:Judicial accountability is in fact a corollary of the independence of the judiciary. Simply put, accountability refers to taking responsibilities for your actions and decisions. It generally means being responsible to any external body; some may insist accountability to principle or to oneself rather to any authority with the power of punishment or correction.Judicial accountability brings about transparency and it can only be achieved if the accountability is ensured and corruption in the system is brought to a stop. Many questions arise as to what has gone wrong with the system. Pt. Nehru has said in a statement, “Judges of the Supreme Court sit on ivory towers far removed from ordinary men and know nothing about them.” Judges are also humans after all and can make errors any time. So how can one achieve accountability in such a system?ISSUES IN MAKING THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM ACCOUNTABLE:Article 124(4) of the Indian Constitution specifies the process of impeachment that is removal of a judge of Supreme Court on the grounds of proven misbehaviour or incapacity. This is the only possible and available mechanism in the judicial system of making the higher judiciary accountable for their actions. In the procedure for removal or impeachment of the judges, a resolution must be passed in each house of parliament by the total majority of members of the house and not less than two-thirds majority of the house present and voting. The process must take place in a single sitting. The resolution has to be presented before the president for his approval.No judge has been impeached till date. However this does mean that there is no corruption in the system. The whole impeachment process is considered to be a failure as it is so lengthy and clumsy.Judicial corruption includes dishonest use or ‘misuse’ of judicial powers by the court authorities leading to unfair and unjust judgements. Due to corruption in judiciary, the public is deprived of the right to fair trial and right to equality. India is the world’s largest democracy. Indian judicial system plays the important role of checks and balances over the executive and the legislature. However, corruption in Indian judiciary is a major threat and it largely diminishes judicial accountability. Citizens need to have faith that the country’s judiciary will provide them justice and equal protection by law. Here are some cases showing how corruption has crippled Indian judiciary:Justice K. Veeraswamy’s caseJustice K. Veeraswamy was the chief justice of Madras High Court. A case was filed against him by the CBI under Prevention of Corruption Act, charging him for possession of assets inconsistent with his income sources. The Madras High Court referred the case to the Supreme Court for dealing with important issues of law. The Supreme Court laid down some stern guidelines for the protection of judicial independence.The Supreme Court’s judgement in this case has been criticized on the ground that this is sheer misuse of judicial independence and it completely overlooks the concept of judicial accountability. It provides an unfair shield to the judges for arbitrary behaviour and use of judicial powers.Sexual Harassment Cases:A retired Supreme Court judge and former Chief Justice of the Orissa High Court, Judge AK Ganguly was accused by a woman intern for sexually harassing her. He was found guilty by the three judge committee even though he continually denied all allegations. He resigned from the West Bengal Human Rights Commission in 2014.Such cases of gross misconduct on behalf of higher judiciary judges are a shame for the Indian Judiciary. High court and Supreme Court judges that are supposed to provide justice to the society are themselves involved in such criminal activities is highly unfortunate. They must not be given the immunity from proper criminal proceedings. They must be tried like any other offender. If such cases keep on rising then there would be no accountability left in the judiciary.In a democracy, the people have the power. And the government bodies or judges, courts etc. are public servants or servants of people. Now, the power of contempt is given to the judges to allow the smooth functioning of the judiciary. However, that does not deprive the right of people of freedom of speech. They can criticize the judges all they want.Article 19(1)(a) gives the right to freedom of speech and expression to the people. But article 129 and 215 give the contempt powers to judges and limit the rights of people. Contempt is generally defined as an act that critically harms the dignity of the court and lowers its authority. There can be two types of contempt: Civil and Criminal.However the Indian judiciary has shown some serious hypocrisy and double standards about practicing Right to Information. If the Right to Information Act is applicable to the legislative and the judiciary, then how is the judiciary exempted from its provisions? Why does judiciary get special treatment?The double standards of courts can be clearly seen after the Right to Information Act has been enacted. The RTI Act clearly applies to the judiciary that is court officials or judges as they are also included under the definition of public servants.The judiciary will always play the card of judicial independence to escape judicial accountability which cannot be tolerated.Judicial activism has recently been seen trespassing its limits and turning to judicial overreach. Judicial intervention in matters of labour policy, ecological and environmental policies, fiscal policy etc. tends to look like judiciary oversteps its authority and interferes with the functioning of the legislature and executive. This is called judicial overreach. Justice JS Verma once stated, “Judicial activism is appropriate when it is in the domain of legitimate judicial review. It should neither be judicial ‘adhocism’ nor judicial tyranny.”It is essential for the smooth functioning of democracy that the difference between “judicial activism” and “judicial overreach” is clearly recognized. The lack of accountability requires judiciary to step back and restrain in its activities.Over the course of three judge’s cases the court evolved the concept of judicial independence to mean that no branch of state, that is, executive or the legislature will have any say in the appointment of judges. The court created the collegium system and put it in function giving exorbitant powers to the senior judges to select and refer the appointments to the government. This whole process is arbitrary as it leads to political favouritism when the appointments are in hands of the executive and judicial overreach when they are in hands of the judiciary. SOLUTIONS TO PROBLEMSThe 80th and 121st Law Commission Reports of India have made the suggestion to form NJC. It is supposed to consist of 5 members:The NJC shall have its own investigative mechanism that shall investigate in the matters of removal of judges. Also the NJC will select the judges for appointment in HC and SC, the information of which will be available to the public. In this way the independence of judiciary is maintained and its accountability to the public too. The bill was introduced in Lok Sabha on December1, 2010.1968-The bill shall lay down judicial standards and provide for accountability of the judiciary. It will establish certain mechanisms to investigate the complaints made against the judges individually. Also, it shall provide a mechanism for the removal of judges. It will replace the old Judges Inquiry Act1969-A five member commission shall be appointed by the president of the recommendation of the prime minister and its cabinet of ministers including the leader of opposition and a minority member.1970-Declaration of assets of judges’ shall be made mandatory.1971-When a complaint is received against the judges, it shall go to the investigating committee. If the charges are serious then the committee can ask the judge to resign, and if he refuses the case will move forward towards the process of removal.1972-All the investigation proceeding information shall be made available to the public.It is important for the judiciary to practice judicial restraint for maintaining the balance between the different organs of democracy. The courts must be concerned with legality and law. Extreme judicial activism can raise questions on its accountability. Curbing judicial activism is required as the judiciary cannot start performing the functions of other organs which shall be totally against the principle of separation of powers. The benchmark of an independent judiciary has been its exclusion from the political and administrative process. Judges must not act like legislators or administrators.The Contempt of Court Act has a lot of loopholes and it gives arbitrary powers to the judiciary. Few suggestions for the amendment were made. The accused must be provided with a reasonable opportunity to defend himself. The contempt cases should not be tried by courts but by independent commissions. The Act must make changes to the definition of criminal contempt so that it does not infringe the rights of the people.CONCLUSIONThe time has come when the judicial independence needs to be interfered with. Judicial independence must go hand in hand with judicial accountability. It is important to acknowledge the fact that the judiciary is not appointed by the people directly. Thus its accountability is questionable. The main task of judiciary is to provide fair trial and speedy justice. It is the organ that protects the society from injustice. It is only through this that the public can acknowledge its accountability.This does not mean that the judiciary has failed completely. If the solutions to the problems are entertained and show a green light then proper functioning of judiciary and judicial accountability can definitely be ensured. By –Taniya MirzaBA LLB (Hons.)Judiciary is the watchdog of Indian Constitution and it checks the functioning of other organs of the government.The judiciary plays a vital role in interpreting the provisions of the constitution and it is important that such interpretation is unbiased ad free from any sort of pressure from the executive or legislature.The judiciary is expected to deliver impartial justice. This is what makes it the most important organ of the government. It is important that the judgements are not influenced by any sort of political inflictions.IMPEACHMENTCORRUPTION IN JUDICIARYNo F.I.R. can be registered against a Judge or Chief Justice of the High Court, or a Judge of the Supreme Court without the sanction of the Chief Justice of India in the matter.It was held that the Supreme Court is not a court of limited jurisdiction of only dispute settling, and that the court has been a law maker and it is the courts responsibility and duty to apply the existing law in a form more favourable to the independence of the judiciary.It was also said that any complaint against a Judge and its investigation by the CBI, if given publicity will have a far reaching impact on the judge and the litigant public therefore there is need of a judicious use of taking action under the Prevention of Corruption Act.CONTEMPT OF COURT RIGHT TO INFORMATION (RTI) AND JUDICIARYJUDICIAL ACTIVISM OR JUDICIAL OVERREACH?

    "data": " A day after a batch of advocates complained about Senior Advocates eating away their chances of getting urgent dates for hearing, Chief Justice of India Dipak Misra Wednesday asked the designated senior lawyers not to orally mention their cases henceforth.As soon as the mentioning began at 10.30 am on Wednesday morning, the CJI stopped Senior Advocates from seeking accommodation for urgent or out of turn listing of cases.“Only Advocates on Record (AoRs) will mention henceforth,” retorted the CJI. AoR is a class of lawyers in the top court who are eligible to file petitions.Justice Misra’s step is in line with what one of his predecessors had done. As a CJI, Justice RM Lodha had also asked Seniors to refrain from mentioning matters and let AoRs and other associate lawyers do so. Justice Lodha had observed this would help junior lawyers shed hesitation to argue in the Supreme Court.On Tuesday morning, Senior Advocates Mukul Rohatgi, Rajeev Dhavan, Meenakshi Arora, Anand Grover, Maninder Singh and a couple of other designated Seniors had queued up sharp at 10.30 to make oral mentioning of their cases and get suitable dates for hearing.In the next 15 minutes, many of these Seniors even mentioned multiple cases and CJI Misra issued instructions to the registry to fix these matters for hearing.Known for his patience, Justice Misra however lost his cool when some junior lawyers, in their anxiety, started arguing simultaneously.“Enough is enough. I am not going to hear mentioning matters any more. All these cases, if there are no objections, will come up for hearing on October 3,” said the CJI.But advocate PV Dinesh still came forward. “I have something to say my Lord. It is not just about my case. Please give me an audience,” said Dinesh.The lawyer went on to add: “We, junior lawyers, have been waiting for 20 minutes to mention our cases but when our turn came, my lord is refusing to hear us. All Senior Advocates were mentioning earlier and we have not got any opprtunity. Will litigants who can’t afford senior lawyers not get a chance?” asked Dinesh.The CJI replied that Dinesh perhaps did not hear him well when he said that all cases will come up of October 3. “We can’t spend whole day in mentioning. This court has to also hear other cases…and we don’t need to learn from anyone what we should do,” said the CJI.But Dinesh retorted: “My lords are right. Other cases are also to be heard. What I want to bring to your attention is that if Senior Advocates can mention multiple cases, won’t others not get a chance to mention even one case? In my case, I have peculiar circumstances and I would request for an opportunity to mention since October 3 may not suit my client.”At this, Justice Misra gave Dinesh an audience and passed suitable orders but the issue remained unresolved as to whether junior lawyers will have equal opportunity.

    "data": " “We have worked speedily to ensure that the people of this country get maximum benefits from the various schemes and policies launched under the NDA govt”, Narendra Modi addressed the public on 26 May 2017, now people of India have to decide that how much NDA government has met with the expectations of all.The Modi Ministry is the Council of Ministers headed by Narendra Modi that was formed after the 2014 general election which was held in nine phases from 7 April to 12 May in 2014. The results of the election were announced on 16 May 2014 and this led to the formation of the 16th Lok Sabha. 21st Ministry of the Republic of India was formed on 26 May 2014 with Pranav Mukherji as the Head of State and Narendra Modi as the Head of NDA Government.The Modi Government has created a setback over other forms of government that either self- rule or through coalitions by introducing so many policies and agendas. Every kind of ruling have to face both achievements and criticisms, none can be perfect or looser, so evaluation of Modi government also concluded with the same. Initially at the time of campaigning, PM Modi directed citizens discussing policies using a slogan, ‘Ache Din Aane Wale Hain’, ‘Clean India Green India’, ‘India Free of Corruption’, ‘Make in India’, ‘Digital India’, ‘Made in India’, etc. but how to decide whether citizens of India are living happily or not.Looking over the achievements of the government which are as follows, for instance the greatest achievement of this government is to provide a corruption free regime. It is remarkable that there is no such allegation of corruption against this government in this periodbut pointing out individually will surely going to catch one or the other political leader of this ruling involved in corruption. It has done fairly well in electrification of the country. It has climbed up to 26th position now in World Bank’s electricity accessibility ranking from 99th spot in 2014. It is doing everything possible to eliminate the black money from India. It has brought in demonetization which had brought back all the cash into the system. It has also made numerous laws to curb black money in India and abroad. It increased the total LPG Consumer base to over 20 cr in 2017 from 14 cr in 2014. It ended the VVIP culture by doing away with beacons for everyone. It got crores of people in the banking net by allowing them to open Jan Dhan accounts with zero balance. It brought all welfare and subsidy schemes under Direct Benefit Transfer to prevent theft, leakage of subsidy to fake and fictitious persons and the most important reform that Modi Government is focusing at present is digitalization i.e. less use of cash in hand and more and more use of e-cards, online transactions, payments, etc.The National Democratic Alliance’s (NDA) government launched many schemes which focuses on financial inclusion, infrastructure development and empowerment of poor people, farmers, etc. like Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Antyodaya Yojana to alleviate poverty through opportunities and skill development, Pradhan Mantri Aawas Yojana-Gramin to provide affordable housing scheme, Sardar Patel Urban Housing Mission to provide housing by 2022 to all eligible, Skill India to fast track skill development; opportunities; scope and space for the development of talents of the Indian Youth, Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana to attain 100% financial inclusion, Mudra Bank Yojana to develop micro units, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Gram Jyoti Yojana to realize 100% electrification, Pradhan Mantri Ujjwala Yojana to provide LPG connection to 5crore BPL families, Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojanato overcome shortcomings of existing schemes, Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana to accomplish water efficiency by 2020, AMRUT (Atal Mission for Rejuvenation and Urban Development) Yojana to develop infrastructure in 500 cities and towns, Atal Pension Yojana to enhance old age income security of working poor, Pradhan Mantri Jeevan Jyoti Bima Yojana to provide life insurance cover to the needy, Pradhan Mantri Suraksha Bima Yojana offers death and disability cover on an accident,Make in India to achieve self-sufficiency in the field of mass production to create India a manufacturing hub for the entire World and to also ensure that there are sufficient job opportunities for the national youth, Startup India Standup India to provide support to all startup businesses in all aspects of doing business in India so that problem of youth employment could be curbed, Garib Kalyan Yojana to ensure welfare needs to poor and underprivileged people, Deen Dayal Upadhyaya Grameen Kaushalya Yojana thataims to train rural youth who are poor and provide them with jobs having regular monthly wages to furnish rural livelihoods, Pradhan Mantri Sukanya Samriddhi Yojana (PMSSY) is an ambitious small deposit savings scheme for a girl child. There are some schemes which are beneficial to the poor, needy people, workers, unemployed youth and farmers of the country like Digital India, Smart India Yojana, DigiLocker, Gold Monetization Scheme, Swadesh Darshan Yojana, HRIDAY, etc. as these are not directly connected to poor people,however, if the latter’s life is uplifted then may be these schemes would come into action and show good consequences. Schemes like Swatchha Bharat, Namami Gange, OROP, Setu Bharatam Project, National Sports Talent Search Scheme, UJWAL Discom Assurance Yojana, Sagarmala Project, Integrated Power Development Scheme are also launched by Modi government.Keeping a neutral eye over government, helps to propose both the aspects of the government that may be either positive or negative. If an analysis is donethen all would come to know how installing all too many policies togethercannot ameliorate the under-developed section of the society. Issues such as urbanizing villages, providing cheaper commodities to the poor, lifting up the irrigation problems of farmers, rendering cheap fertilizers, agricultural instruments, etc. to eliminate suicidal cases of peasants in India are even not resolved precisely. If campaigning period of Modi is being pointed out then all are going to realize that Kashmir is still not in peace and tranquility and citizens know that the situation is far from reality. The most shaking issue is Cow Vigilantism which is extremely going out of the hands of the government. Modi government promotes Hinduism is known by all but simultaneously it also tries to uplift other communities and groups from their stagnant positions but promoting, favouring and giving importance to one group more than others can raise issues of communalism and hatred amongst various groups and the government can even be targeted and pulled down with a heavy hand because such dirty tricks can lead to polarization of one family. UP’s Elections shook everyone with such a high majority win that clearly showed that how much citizens of UP loved and Voted for BJP despite of their religion, caste, creed or language especially Muslim women presented their active participation to get rid of Triple Talaq rule of Shariath Law which is purely one-sided divorce because BJP promised to ban triple talaq system and to introduce Uniform Civil Code which is again a disputable issue in India. Indian’s full support to Kulbhushan Jadav who was indiscreetly harassed, tortured and putting his life on the track of doom’s day by Pakistani government without proper investigation was a great blunder for India, so this is quite appreciable that India values Human Rights more than any other thing. The External Affairs Minister headed by Sushma Swaraj earned laurels for helping the Indian living abroad, be it for rescuing Kerala nurses from war torn Libya or bringing back differently abled Geeta from Pakistan. India’s policy Make in India is going to give a hard push to China because India from its earlier stages of economic development focused more over the primary and tertiary sectors so she could not develop and prosper much but launching this policy is going to boost secondary i.e. manufacturing sector of the economy that will show excellent results after few years. Some other examples like introducing Bullet Train with a cooperation of Japan’s PM Shinzo Abe is likely to be a great investment for our country’s economy.India under Modi government has also signed an agreement to solve out India Bangladesh land boundary issue because there was a serious need of preventing Rohingya’s refugees entering India in the West Bengal region. Another disputable issue was UDAY Aadhar scheme which was thought to be an infringement of Right to Privacy protected under Article 21 of the Indian Constitution that guarantees Right to Life and Personal Liberty but then government declared full protection of all individuals falling under Aadhar scheme. Mr. Modi is always well loved for his efforts to get proclaimed 21 June as the Yoga Day by the U.N. and also for addressing public on Sundays through Mann Ki Baat which is broadcasted on radios.Recently PM Modi addressed in Dabhoi saying, “Let us leave no stone unturned in creating a ‘New India’ by 2022, when we mark 75 years of India’s freedom. Sardar Sarovar Dam faced so many obstacles. But, we were determined that the project will go on.” According to him Sardar Sarovar Dam project will change the fortunes of the farmers of not only Gujarat but Maharashtra, Madhya Pradesh and Rajasthan as well. The waters of Maa Narmada will help several citizens and transform several lives.In India opposition plays a beautiful role in making government realize its faults and flaws. Role of opposition is not only to target the ruling administration but also to clear out issues to make the government better understand the grievances of its citizens as far as possible to realize the economic development because only focusing on economic growth is not sufficient enough to transfer a country’s status from developing to developed one. Mr. Modi is trying to bring developmental strategies in every field through regular visits to different nations during these three years to illumine India’s culture, economy, education, society and lastly politics. Regardless of all public oriented policies andprogrammes ruling government should be criticized firstly, for encouraging religious intolerance, secondly, for not stepping down the reservation policy that was promised duringcampaigning of 2014, thirdly, for trying to privatize every sector of the economy that is going to be a great loss for coal mines and many other sectors in the coming days which can even increase unemployment ratio of the country and for Gorakhpur tragedy where many lives of small kids were negligently put to death due to lack of oxygen cylinders in the hospital, not only this, UP government promised to give relief to peasants who are under the huge debts is also not solved by the government. Many medical seats are still bought even after so much stricter rules laid down by their government to check cheating and frauding. Bringing back the issue of Ram Mandir by the BJP government is something seen to be self-destructive and no doubt that the government is digging its own grave for the elections of 2019.There is an urgent need to realize the above-mentioned issues as people are sitting on the trenches for their wishes to get fulfilled with satisfactory results and the government must remember the days are not so far away when citizens would be seen fighting, protesting, marching, and abusing the government for all what committed by the government has not been seen in actions so far.So, a big question mark (?) should be put on Mr. Modi’s dream “ACHE DIN AANE WALE HAIN”!!By:Priyanshi ChandrawatIndore Institute of Law"

    "headline": "Marital Rape under Indian LawABETMENT AND CRIMINAL CONSPIRACY – THE DIFFERENCEAn Overview of the Consumer Protection Act, 2019Is Hinduism a way of life or just a religion? SC to re-examine today",
    "data": " “Sexual intercourse by a man with his own wife the wife not being under fifteen years of age, is not rape “This is what our IPC section 375 exception 2 says. Recently, a petition was filed in Delhi High Court challenging this law (RIT Foundation v. Union of India). This incident arouses few important questions in our mind. Firstly, what actually is marital rape? How can a husband having sexual intercourse with his wife be termed as “rape”?In a society like ours, where patriarchy system exist, where in some cases after marrying a woman a man doesn’t feel the need to ask for the consent of the wife before engaging into sexual activities, what else do we expect other than a victim, who is domestically abused and sexually harassed by her own husband. So, yes, a husband having sexual intercourse with his wife can be termed as “rape” if it’s without the consent of the wife.Another question that comes to our mind is that, should we criminalize this wrong? Should it be treated like an ordinary rape case? Now, this is a controversial question which brings us back to our case law.Here is the verdict that was given by Delhi High Court regarding this case:“What may appear to be marital rape to an individual wife may not appear so to others. As to what constitute marital rape and what would constitute marital non rape needs to be defined precisely before a view on criminalization is taken…..it has been adequately ensured that marital rape does not become a phenomena which may destabilize the institution of marriage, apart from being a easy tool for harassing husbands….if all acts by the man with his own wife qualify as marital rape, then the judgment as to whether it is marital rape or not will singularly rest with wife.”–Union of India submission in Delhi High Court (28/08/2017)The government reasoning here is presumed or seems to be acquired by instances of dowry law in our country. Misuse of dowry law by women against their husbands was set as an example by many who voted against criminalization of marital rape.Let’s take a reality check. In 2015, a survey in India revealed that one in five men have forced their wives to have sexual intercourse. More than two-thirds of Indian married women between 15 and 49 years old claimed to have been beaten or forced into sex by their husbands. Around 665 cases have been reported in 2015 in NGOs by women who faced domestic violence and marital rape, but the cases registered with court are very few.The lawmakers cannot turn a blind eye to such an unpardonable deed. It degrades the dignity of a married woman and they become like paraphernalia for the men who use them in the way they desire for these own pleasure and comfort. Marital rape is a more serious and debatable matter, and should be looked upon deeply by our law and society to find a solution to stop this obnoxious practice.By-Aishwarya Gupta"

    "headline": "Breaking Stereotype: Right to Equality is for AllTHE SCOPE OF CHIEF MINISTER ADVOCATES WELFARE FUNDSURROGACY LAWS IN INDIAThe Vulnerability of Data: A Look at Data Breaches and the Statutory Framework in India",
    "data": "Okay. Here it is. RIGHT TO EQUALITYEquality is something which we, the people of India, demand from the very beginning of our life, say, from the day we were born, till death. A kid, probably 3-4 years old, when given 2 chocolates and sees that her sister got 3 chocolates, starts crying and yells for why she got 3 and me just 2. That kid demands for equality in chocolates. A student demands for equality in marks. A husband and wife demands equality in their relationship. It might sound funny but we demand equality even at the time of funeral that if his funeral was so done, then why ours can’t be like one! Yup, funny but true.Right to equality states that every citizen of India is equal in the eyes of law. Says, the constitution of Indiaguarantee the right to equality to every citizen of India, prohibits discrimination on grounds of religion, caste, race and SEX. Yes, I know, you may be thinking, why “SEX” in bold letters? It is because discrimination on ground of sex is like highlight of every newspaper and television broadcasts these days.Yes, this was the problem we suffered years back and undoubtedly we are suffering till date. It is no more right to gender equality but much more about gender inequality.Few days back, I had an incident. There was this young, attractive girl who wore heavy makeup, had long silky hair and luscious nails. She wore a skimpy top which was riding up just enough to reveal her pretty slim belly. And then you know the rest. She was all set to be judged by people around her. We have heard a lot about women fighting and raging for equality and our constitution prevails many rights, laws and protection for them. But what about MEN? Think MEN get equal rights? What I think is absolutely ‘NOT’. We talk about WOMEN, WOMEN and WOMEN, leaving MEN ignored.There was a case of SYED AHMED MAKHDOOM, who committed suicide, tired of fighting false dowry case against him and separation from his beloved son. His wife ended him in humiliation and harassment. And this is not just one case but there have many many more cases, where the court simply gives judgement in favour of WOMEN because they are WOMEN. MEN are being victimized and accused, unwitting accomplices in the perpetuation of inequality and discrimination. They are being target of frequent undenial, in the face sexism.Everybody is really concerned about crime against women. There are many act and provisions and laws and the list goes like- sexual harassment of women at workplace act(2013), dowry prohibition act(1961) ….. But have we heard of rights for men, against crimes done to him?????We have heard of many cases, of husband torturing his wife for dowry. Yes, I totally agree, there are actual cases but there many more cases of wives filing false dowry cases against husbands which are not actually revealed to the general public. Every day from somewhere or the other we come across cases of men accused for teasing women. Doesn’t matter if you’ve done something wrong or not but you have been accused under the law. And the fact over viewed is that merely 15% of people are actually found guilty.I have been through many videos on YouTube and the husbands have literally cried and felt so helpless and finally taken suicide, as the ultimate choice.Section 498 of IPC, a law that was made with a very noble intention to prevent violence and cruelty against women. But today, this law has been made the most accused law in the history of Indian jurisprudence.So, let’s take a look at the brain processes that drive by us, how it shows up and most important, whether there are something we can do about it. When I went through more cases like syed’s, it moved me into tears. Syed committed suicide in 2009 and till date there haven’t been any new judgements in such cases and remained same as always. There may be just few cases on fingers that gave true justice to men for his rights.I am a woman and I always stand by any wrong done against women. Any kind of women abuse or violence or discrimination is absolutely not acceptable. I know that the rights for women are very important but it does not mean that MEN remain invisible with their RIGHTS OF EQUALITY.My only concern here is, if we say equality this, equality that, then why not equality in rights of men and women? If not so, WHAT DOES EQUALITY MEAN THEN????IF IT IS RIGHT TO EQUALITY, IT MUST MEAN SO. PRATIBHA ELIN LAKRAINDORE INSTITUTE OF LAW"

    "headline": "MEDICAL TERMINATION OF PREGNANCY ACT 1971Chhattisgarh CJ AK Tripathi resigns whereas Justice PK Mishra has been appointedTO END CHILD MARRIAGE IS SOMETHING MORE THAN LAW: NEEDS TRUST ON EQUALITYUnique case in history of India and Pakistan- Kulbhusan Jadhav’s case",
    "data": "Abortion, a method by which foetus in mother’s womb is eliminated. In a country like India, this practice may be termed as a taboo. But, its actually legal through a law termed as medical termination of pregnancy act 1971. Before 1971 abortion was illegal and punishable under IPC, but continuous growth in number of illegal abortions resulting in maternal mortality and morbidity, forced the Indian parliamentto introduce a new law for abortion. Still its quite difficult for a women to decide the future of her own body part (foetus). It’s so ironic that the one who has to carry the weight of baby till its birth has no right in the MTP act of 1971. The act has had various amendments, but still its not perfect yet.The law allowed registered medical practitioners to terminate pregnancy for socio-medical reasons, and also for the reasons of danger to mother’s health. The law spared women from inflicted and forced pregnancy. The Act was amended in 2002 and underwent changes like- abortion of the foetus could only be performed in government hospitals or places approved by the government, termination could be done only by registered medical practitioners, also punishment to the doers if abortion took place somewhere not approved by the government. If termination was required to be done of foetus <12 weeks, a single doctor’s agreement was required. Whereas to terminate foetus between 12 to 20 weeks old, consent of two doctors were required. Termination of pregnancy at any of the stages by a single doctor in good faith in necessary condition to save the life of mother was allowed etc.The current law based on the amendment made in 2014, forces women to justify the practitioners in good faith the reason for abortion which makes them completely dependent on the doctor. This makes unmarried women, sex workers vulnerable to exploitation. The amendment bill removed this barrier by recognising the need of unmarried women to for abortions. Also, if women demands abortion in the first trimester she can without justifying the cause or needs. . Under the 1971 Act, Rape victims cannot abort after 20 weeks which forced them to move to the court of law. Earlier the law had the limitation to the gestational age i.e. foetus to be < 20 weeks. The law believed that abortion after 20 weeks has a big reason behind it and that is for female foeticide. Gender determination of a foetus can be done after 20 weeks and thus to prevent killings of female baby in mother’s womb the court has imposed restrictions on gestational age. But it is claimed by scientists that conclusive determination of foetal abnormality in most of the cases is only possible after 20th week of gestational age. After the amendment, gestational age has been increased from 20 to 24 weeks. But, scientist believe that brain feels some sort of pain only after 26 weeks, thus putting 24 weeks bar of gestation age is still incorrect.The Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act is a very disputed law as it involves rights of two – first, the mother and second, the foetus. Women can get abortion if the practitioner feels that there is a risk of life to the women, a threat to a women’s mental and physical health , or risk is there that the child will be born seriously handicapped. Also, in section (3) of the act it is stated that the length of pregnancy shall not apply to abort a foetus diagnosed with foetal abnormalities as may be prescribed. The law violates the fundamental rights article 19(right to freedom) and Article 21(right to protection of life and personal liberty) of a women. Right existing for the foetus is unclear as it is not a complete human body whose existence or right to life is being violated.Child-bearing, motherhood strongly tell that it’s women’s right whether she wants to become a mother or not, she wants to bear the child or not, whether she wants to carry the weight or not, she is the one to decide was pregnancy against her will or of her will. Thus, imposing a 24 week restriction on abortion completely violates rights of women and requiring permission from registered practitioners makes it discriminatory in nature.BY:ARIHANT AGRAWALINDORE INSTITUTE OF LAW"

    "data": "The Yoga guru Baba Ramdev recently cautioned that the “Entire saint tradition should not be seen in a bad light if a religious figure is found guilty in a criminal case. There are still millions of saints in the country who are living a life full of honesty, purity and serving the common people. Lord Ram is the grateful symbol of Indian culture. If there is any saint on a person bearing the Ram, it only sullies the character of that particular person. It should not be associated with entire religion, sect, tradition or culture.”The above wordings of Baba Ramdev clearly depicts that India is a land of Sadhus and Babas who have always occupied a pious and eminent position not only in the society but also in the hearts and minds of the people. Some call it a superstition while for others it is a religious fanaticism.The 76-year-old guru has been in a Rajasthan jail since August 2013 over allegations of raping a 16-year-old school girl at his ashram. Baba has been in jail for more than four years. He and his son Narayan Sai were booked for the alleged rape of two sisters at their ashram in Gujarat’s Surat. Again, one more case popularly known as Ram Rahim Case has reopened the chapters of the history of fake Babas playing with the religious sentiments of their disciples. Consequently, these vulnerable issues are breaking trust and faith of devotees over saints and this may be going to lead a disastrous effect on the whole nation.The Dera Sacha Sauda, which describes itself as a social welfare and spiritual organization, was set up in 1948. The supporters say their main agenda is social welfare, “We are into blood donation, tree plantation, cleanliness drives, rescuing prostitutes and making them our daughters”. Ram Rahim was made the successor of the same. He was small when he was brought to the ashram because he believed in spirituality hence the guru impressed from him and carried him there and gradually made the heir. He is popularly known as “Guru in Bling” and “Rockstar Baba”. The self-styled “Godman” has been controversial for years. He has been convicted of sexually exploiting two women followers at his Sirsa Ashram at Haryana in 2002 besides the former description he was also accused of the murder of a journalist and in 2007, he was in trouble for dressing up as Sikh Guru Gobind Singh. Separately a court has asked the CBI to investigate whether he encouraged 400 men to undergo castration, promising it would benefit them spiritually. Finally, on 26 August 2017, Dera Sacha Sauda chief Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh has been found guilty of raping two women followers in 2002. He was charged under various sections of IPC – 365 (kidnapping or abducting), 344 (wrongful confinement for ten or more days), 346 (wrongful confinement in secret) and 120B (criminal conspiracy).Baba wanted to use more and more handwriting samples of his female devotees to help himself come out of this situation but that gave rise to a hilarious scene when Justice Mishra commented saying that once French writer Victor Hugo, whose “secretary for 49 years kept writing letters to him about her devotion and submission to him but he never tried to seduce her”.Devotion, love, trust, and faith entail protests, marches and bring masses on the road favouring such babas and sadhus for instance when baba was convicted then a lot many devotees ignited widespread riots, the property was destroyed and burnt. The government ordered Haryana police to maintain law and order. The latter tried to do so by cutting off mobile internet services and asked the army to be ready to intervene if required, 22 trains to Punjab and 7 to Haryana had been cancelled. Shops, ATMs, cinema halls, petrol pumps, located near Dera headquarters in Sirsa were closed. Curfew was also imposed in many areas of nearby States. The death toll in the violence that erupted in Haryana climbed to 31 and nearly 250 were injured after the rape conviction proved.There is a need to realise what is good and bad for the society, people who blindly believe in religious saints and even act on their suggestions are surviving on the verge of risks. In the 21st century, people are required to reiterate whatever they think and act because God exists in everybody’s heart and soul and enlightens all with positive energy and the former does not want any mediator to get itself highlighted, connected and renowned in everyone’s soul. It is all depended upon one’s faith in God. Therefore, to get closer to God one must not follow unworthy rituals and customs. By:Priyanshi ChandrawatIndore Institute of Law"

    "data": "PANAMA PAPERSThe Panama Papers are the secrets of dirty money and an unprecedented leak of about 2.6 terabytes of data that includes approximately 11.5 million documents more than the combined total of the Wikileaks Cablegate, Offshore Leaks, Lux Leaks, and Swiss Leaks. The data primarily comprises e-mails, pdf files, photo files, and excerpts of an internal Mossack Fonseca, the world’s fourth biggest offshore law firm’s database. It covers a period spanning from the 1970s to the spring of 2016. With the anonymous source only interested in a few security measures to be complied with, shared the information with the German newspaper Süddeutsche Zeitung, who decided to analyze the data in cooperation with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). As months followed by, the leaked data continued to grow way beyond the original leak, making the leak the biggest that journalists had ever worked with. The ICIJ then shared them with a large network of international partners, including the Guardian and the BBC.The data provides rare insights into a world that can only exist in the shadows. It proves how a global industry led by major banks, legal firms, and asset management companies secretly manages the estates of the world’s rich and famous: from politicians, Fifa officials, fraudsters and drug smugglers, to celebrities and professional athletes.HOW PANAMA PAPERS CHANGED THE POLITICAL AIR IN PAKISTANOn April 3, last year, when “Panama Papers” were leaked, “the Sharif” family was brought under undesired yet prominent limelight. These leaks in April 2016 revealed that three of Mr Sharif’s children owned offshore companies and assets not shown on his family’s wealth statement. The companies were allegedly used to channel funds to acquire foreign assets, including some apartments along Park Lane in London’s Mayfair area. On April 5, 2016, almost two days after Panama Papers leak, Nawaz Sharif, a former Prime Minister of Pakistan, under increasing political pressure said that “he is open to the formation of a judicial commission to probe his family’s alleged finances in offshore tax-havens”.With the case in its infancy and a midst swelling political turmoil, Pakistan Muslim League (N) proposed the terms of reference (ToRs), which were rejected by the opposition leaders from the PTI, PPP, MQM, PML-Q who demanded the ToRs of any such commission to be drafted in consultation with them. After a joint meeting between opposition parties, a set of ToRs were presented to the government and the media, which was then rejected by the Government on the grounds that it was more focused on targeting the prime minister personally rather than eliminating corruption. This controversy circled into a deadlock when the Supreme Court returned the federal government’s request to appoint any inquiry commission to investigate the leaked document’s connection with the Sharif family.The Supreme Court registrar Arbab Mohammad Arif in a letter sent to the law secretary said, “Formation of commission of inquiry under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act 1956 (Act VI of 1956), looking to its limited scope, will result in the constitution of a toothless commission, which will serve no useful purpose, except giving bad name to it,”. The letter also observes that the ToRs of the proposed commission are so “wide and open” that “it may take years” for the commission to conclude proceedings.The Panamagate controversy started making a more sorted way to Justice when, almost after four months of the mammoth leak, several petitions reached the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Among them was the one by Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf(PTI) of Imran Khan which was filed against 10 respondents, which include Nawaz Sharif, his daughter his son-in-law retired Capt Mohammad Safdar and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar for their alleged involvement in the Panamagate scandal. Jamaat-e-Islami and Jamhoori Watan Party as well approached the Pakistan’s Apex court with their petitions.Meanwhile, opposition was going berserk, holding rallies and protests across the country. Where, Imran urged followers to put up ‘country’s biggest ever demonstration’, PTI protested outside Sharif residence, demanding Nawaz’s resignation and Islamabad lockdown were to be the major ones.In November, the Supreme Court sought responses from both the petitioners and the Nawaz Sharif family. The court was then still considering whether or not to appoint a judicial commission to probe the Panamagate scandal. And the big question hovering was: how did Nawaz Sharif’s children pay for their London properties? As like a result of some magical wand, the PML-N counsel Mohammad Akram Sheikh pulls out a document dated Nov 5, 2016 — marked private, confidential and not to be disclosed to any party, except for the benefit of the courts of Pakistan — on the letterhead of Hamad Bin Jassim Bin Jaber Al Thani, who ruled Qatar from 2007 to 2013. With this letter, Prince Jassim of Qatar presented a different story trying to refine the confusion. However, the Supreme Court was not pleased to hear yet another explanation for how the Sharif family paid for its London properties, observing that both sides were doing their best to ensure that the court would eventually have to form a commission to decide the Panamagate case.A break was put to the case, as Chief Justice Zaheer Jamali, member of the five-bench was scheduled to retire. The Apex Court stated that the Supreme Court of Pakistan, shall commence the arguments from both sides afresh and hearings shall resume from January 4, 2017.As scheduled, Panamagate graft case started afresh. On January 12, 2017, two different money trails puzzled the bench and the prime minister’s counsel was asked to prove as to why there were inconsistencies in the prime minister’s speech in the National Assembly last year. “There are two different money trails before us. How did the money go from Jeddah and then to London? And how did the money go from Dubai to London and then Qatar?” the judge asked. On January 26, 2017, a second letter is floated by Hussain Nawaz’s counsel, ‘clarifying’ Sharif’s investment in Gulf Steel Mills. The letter is accompanied by transaction details and auditor’s reports regarding the Gulf Steel Mills in Dubai and the Azizia Steel Mills in Jeddah.With every evidence, affidavits, arguments and witnesses statements, the case despite getting clearer was only getting blurred to vagueness. The Supreme Court on January 31, 2017 expressed its concern over NAB and Qatari letters. As the Pamanagate case hearing resumed, NAB Prosecutor General Waqas Qadeer Dar was called once again to the stand and questioned why the ruling in the Hudaibiya Paper Mills case was not appealed. During the hearing, the five-judge bench also questioned the absence of any mention of the Qatari investments in Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif’s speech in the National Assembly and in Tariq Shafi’s affidavit presented to the apex court. “We were told that all evidence had been made available, and that perhaps it was we who were unable to see it in its entirety,” said Justice Asif Saeed Khosa. Later on in February, despite the documents from the Panama Papers suggesting that the beneficial owner of the luxury central London flats was Mr Sharif’s daughter Maryam, she later claimed that she was only a trustee – and that it was her brother who was the beneficial owner. To prove her point, Maryam Nawaz produced a trust deed signed by both her and her brother dated February 2006. But a British forensic expert later said the document was “fake” or had been “falsified” because it was typed in the Calibri font, which was not commercially available until 2007. Justice Saeed expressed the bench’s frustration by saying that the lawyers were issuing different statements each time, which was confusing the bench. “If a story has been made up, you should stick to it,” he remarked.Finally, on February 23, 2017, Panamagate hearings concluded with judgement awaited. On April 20, 2017, neither a clean chit, nor a conviction: Supreme Court issued split verdict on Panamagate case and ordered formation of joint investigation team (JIT) comprising Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI), MI (Military Intelligence), NAB, SECP and SBP officials.The JIT submitted its report on July 10 after a 60-day probe in which it tried to establish the money trail for the assets acquired by the Nawaz Sharif family. The insinuation that the offshore companies were meant to hide or launder ill-gotten wealth or to avoid taxes called Mr Sharif’s credentials into question. In its report, the JIT told the Supreme Court that the Sharif family failed to reveal the source of income for the acquisition of their London apartments. It concluded that Nawaz Sharif and his family owned assets beyond the known sources of income.On July 21, 2017, the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) takes SECP Chairman Zafar Hijazi into custody in Islamabad after its investigation revealed he had allegedly altered records related to the Sharif family’s Chaudhry Sugar Mills. The SC also ordered Hijazi’s arrest in light of the FIA and JIT’s probe reports. Later, on July 28, the bench disqualified Nawaz Sharif from holding public office. The court ordered the Election Commission of Pakistan to de-notify the prime minister from his National Assembly seat to fulfill the technicalities of implementing the order. The Supreme Court said the ECP should de-seat the PM for not disclosing his role in the Dubai-based Capital FZE company in his nomination papers, saying that this meant he was not ‘honest’ and ‘truthful’. Pakistan Finance Minister Ishaq Dar was also disqualified by the court and the court has recommended anti-corruption cases against several individuals, including Mr Sharif, his daughter Maryam, her husband Safdar and others.Pakistan has yet again repeated history with its 18th Prime Minister, the decision brought an end to Sharif’s third term in power, who if was not disqualified would have become the first Pakistani Prime Minister to complete a full five-year term.PANAMA HUNTS DOWN ANOTHER LEADERWith this, Sharif becomes the second world leader to lose his post over his links to the Panama Papers; Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson was forced to resign as the prime minister of Iceland shortly after his wife’s interest in an offshore company was revealed as part of the Panama Papers investigation in April, 2016. David Cameron came under intense scrutiny over his family’s tax affairs.

    "headline": "SC: CLEARS THE RELEASE OF MADHUR BHANDARKAR’S FILM INDU SARKARA STANCE ON THE FARMER BILL OF 2020BCI not to grant affiliation to any new law colleges for next three yearsOn Policing In Pandemic, Mindless Arrests & Prison Overcrowding : Criminal Justice & Police Accountability Project",
    "data": "We live in a country, where people get offended by mere a drop of a water. Especially with cinema! The moment a film is announced, people do look for certain aspects of the film and manipulate points and state that it hurts their religious sentiments or is deprecatory, hence putting an undue pressure on the production/release. Filmmakers have to carefully tread with everything – be it the title, theme or even dialogues which may at times be really frustrating. Several films in India have stirred up controversies pertaining to religion, cast or some other factors, result being the never ending discussions, debates, writs, police complaints and FIRs, but never a concrete solution.A similar situation has been observed recently with Hindi filmmaker Madhur Bhandarkar for his film ‘Indu Sarkar’, which is based on the 21-month Emergency between 1975 and 1977 imposed by the then Prime Minister of India, Indira Gandhi. Indu Sarkar deals with the controversial state of Emergency imposed by Indira Gandhi in 1975, a period of deep unrest which saw civil liberties being suspended across the country. What is to be thought here is that why is it so that religious, cultural and political organizations stir up when it comes to the depiction of their leaders? Since time immemorial India has seen many great leaders but why is it that a true depiction of them is still missing from popular culture? Conversely, we often tend to recourse to the hagiographies that give a distorted recollection of the history.According to Madhur Bhandarkar 70% of the story of movie ‘Indu Sarkar’ is fictional and 30% is true, still repercussions have arisen pertaining to the movie. Priya Singh Paul, who claims to be the biological daughter of late Sanjay Gandhi, had moved to the Supreme Court seeking a stay on the release of movie ‘Indu Sarkar’ on the grounds that the movie is full of concocted facts and is totally derogatory.The Counsel for the petitioner claims that the movie contains derogatory facts to culminate the image of the former Prime Minister, Indira Gandhi. She had moved Supreme Court after the Bombay High Court rejected her plea.The HC after hearing the parties at length, dismissed the writ petition as it observed that she had no locus to file the present petition at this stage since her claim on biological lineage to Sanjay Gandhi is pending adjudication. The court acknowledged that the scope of judicial review is very limited once a film is certified by CBFC which is an expert statutory body to certify films.The Supreme Court bench of justices Dipak Misra, Amitava Roy and A M Khanwilkar dismissed the petition filed by Priya Singh Paul on the notions that National interest or the right to know is paramount than an individual’s reputation. Also exhibition of movie is an artistic expression within the parameters of law and there is no justification to curtail the release of the movie, and that a film’s script is obvious to have a little exaggeration. Also a strong point in favour of Madhur Bhandarkar is that the censor board has already made relevant edits and certified the movie for release with necessary disclaimers.Priya Singh Paul wanted that the film’s release should be put at stay till the producers remove the 30% of the content that has been based on true facts, as stated by Mr. Bhandarkar. She had alleged that the main characters of the film are depicting her late Sanjay Gandhi and his mother Indira Gandhi in bad light. She claimed that she had recently learnt about her biological lineage and is in the process of establishing it.All things said and done the apex court has rejected her plea and the movie will be released as per scheduled i.e. on July 28, 2017 which is a great sign of relief to Mr. Bhandarkar.Compiled by:Priyanka Jaiswal NUSRL, Ranchi"

The lawyer used an offensive word, amounting to accusing Jaitley of being a criminal, during proceedings of the Rs 10-crore defamation case against Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders. This week, the Delhi Chief Minister has in an affidavit told the court: “With due respect it is submitted that neither Kejriwal nor the counsel briefing the senior counsel Jethmalani gave instructions to the senior counsel to use the objectionable words on May 17, 2017.”Mr Kejriwal has told the court that he had even written to Mr Jethmalani to refute his claim that he had instructions “to use objectionable words.”It was in response to an application by Mr Jaitley that said, “numerous irrelevant and scandalous questions have been asked during the cross examination of the Union minister and abusive and defamatory statements have been made” on the instructions of Mr Kejriwal.Following Kejriwal’s denial of having instructed the lawyer to use derogatory language against Jaitley during court proceedings on May 17, the lawyer has written a letter to the CM, accusing him of using even more offensive language against Jaitley during private discussions on the case.Jethmalani has asked Kejriwal to settle his legal fees amounting to more than Rs 2 crore. The lawyer used an offensive word, amounting to accusing Jaitley of being a criminal, during proceedings of the Rs 10-crore defamation case against Kejriwal and five other AAP leaders.

He has sought Rs. 10 crore in damages for the harm caused to his reputation.Mr Jaitley has sought an additional 10 crore in his new suit. Sources:Times of India and NDTV "

    "headline": "LAWS SAFEGUARDING THE LEGAL RIGHTS OF ELDERS IN INDIADIGITALIZATION OF COURT PROCEEDINGS: – A NEW WAY TO INDIAN JUDICIARYKINDER-MISHANDLING AND MENTAL HEALTHBombay High Court: Manjula chellur as chief justice",
    "data": "BY: ADITI MARWAHAIndia is a country having a big population of elder citizens. We Indians are taught from childhood to respect our elders but unfortunately in the present scenario this is only said and not done. Children are so engaged in their lives that they completely forget about the people who are responsible for their existence and this leads to elder abuse or elders being admitted to old age homes and day care centres. This is a sad part as there are 103.6 million elderly people (60+) living in India today (Government of India, Ministry of Statistics and Programme Implementation, 2016). And according to a recent survey conducted by the NGO Help-Age India in 2014, 50% of elderly people are being abused in their homes. Amongst those who experience abuse, only 59.47% people made an attempt to report the abuse while 40.53% people didn’t report about the abuse they were facing. The reason for not reporting the matters of abuse is that most of these abused elderly people are not aware of the rights and remedies available to them and even if they do, they won’t report such incidences as they do not want to spoil their family’s reputation and they also fear retribution, isolation and neglect from their family members if they go out to complaint.The various problems that elderly people go through today are:International efforts to strengthen elders in various countries have been taken like making of an Action Plan on Ageing in 1982 by the General Assembly and various follow-up actions have been taken afterwards like:(i) In 1992, the United Nations General Assembly adopted the proclamation to observe the year 1999 as the International Year of the Older Persons. (ii) The U.N.General Assembly has declared “1st October” as the International Day for the Elderly, later rechristened as the International Day of the Older Persons. (iii) The U.N.General Assembly on December 16, 1991 adopted 18 principles which are organized into 5 clusters, namely-independence, participation, care, self-fulfilment, and dignity of the older persons. These principles provide a broad framework for action on ageing. Some of the Principles are as follows : (i) Older Persons should have the opportunity to work and determine when to leave the work force. (ii) Older Persons should remain integrated in society and participate actively in the formulation of policies which effect their well-being. (iii) Older Persons should have access to health care to help them maintain the optimum level of physical, mental and emotional well-being. (iv) Older Persons should be able to pursue opportunities for the full development of their potential and have access to educational, cultural, spiritual and recreational resources of society. (v) Older Persons should be able to live in dignity and security and should be free from exploitation and mental and physical abuse.Nationally also the Government has made certain laws to safeguard elders from such an abuse and live with dignity. There are various provisions as well as rights and privileges granted to elderly for their convenience. These are as follows:Constitutional Protection:Provisions are mentioned in the Constitution of India for senior citizens of India. Directive Principles of state policy talk about these provisions. Article 41 and Article 46 are the constitutional provisions for the protections of elderly. However the Directive Principles, as stated in Article 37, are not enforceable by any court of law. But Directive Principles impose positive obligations on the state, i.e., what it should do. The Directive Principles have been declared to be fundamental in the governance of the country and the state has been placed under an obligation to apply them in making laws. The courts however cannot enforce a Directive Principle as it does not create any justiciable right in favour of any individual. It is most unfortunate that state has not made even a single act which is directly related to the elderly persons.Article 41: Right to work, to education and to public assistance in certain cases. The state shall, within the limits of its economic capacity and development, make effective provision for securing the right to work, to education, and to public assistance in cases of unemployment, old age, sickness and disablement, and in other cases of undeserved want.Every citizen has the right to work over a certain period of time. They cannot be retired from doing their work whether in the private or the public sphere.Article 41 provides that it is the right of the citizen of India to right to work, to education and to public assistance within the capacity of the state.Article 46: Promotion of educational and economic interests of Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes and other weaker sections. The state shall promote with special care the educational and economic interests of the weaker sections of the people and shall protect them from social injustice and all forms of exploitation.Legislative Protections:Under Personal Laws:The moral duty to maintain parents is recognised by all people. However, as far as law is concerned, the position and extent of such liability varies from community to community.Hindu Laws:Under the Hindu Personal Laws, every Hindu has the obligation to take care of their aged parents who are not able to maintain and take care of themselves.Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956The Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 empowers our elderly people with legal rights to claim maintenance from their children. Laws and rights under this Act can however be accessed by only Hindus. These laws do not apply to non-Hindu citizens of the country.Section 20 of the HAMA, 1956, deals with the maintenance of children and aged parents. Under this section, it is clearly mentioned that it is the responsibility of a person to maintain their old and aged parent if they are not able to maintain themselves. Section 23 of this Act deals with the amount of maintenance that is to be paid to the old and aged parents. According to this section, the court has the discretion to decide the amount or alter the amount already agreed upon to be paid to the aged parents, if it feels that the original amount offered might not be sufficient for their survival.Under the modern codified Hindu laws, it is not only the son who has the responsibility to maintain the aged parents; such obligation also lies upon the daughter to maintain them. Maintenance can be claimed by both the natural and adoptive parents. However, step-parents, having their own children cannot claim maintenance under this Act. Muslim Law:Muslims are also legally entitled to maintain their parents, provided, they have the means to do so.According to Mulla, a son is entitled to maintain his mother even under “strained” circumstances, if she is poor, even if not “infirm”. The son is also bound to maintain his father if he is earning nothing.There exists no concept of adoption under Muslim law. Hence there exists no provision for the maintenance of adoptive parents under Muslim law. Christian and Parsi Law:There is no personal law for Christian and Parsi for providing maintenance to the aged parents. If the parents want to seek maintenance from their children, they can apply through the Criminal Procedure Code to seek maintenance. Under the Criminal Procedure Code:The Criminal Procedure Code is a secular law which is applicable to the entire region. This is not for a particular section and is applicable to every citizen of the country.Section 125 under the Cr.P.C. 1973 deals with the maintenance of old parents. Under this section, old parents, irrespective of their religion can seek maintenance.The provision for maintenance of parents under the code was introduced for the first time in Section 125(1) of the Code of Criminal Procedure in 1973. As per the code if any person having sufficient means neglects or refuses to maintain his father or mother, unable to maintain himself or herself, a Magistrate of the first class may, upon proof of such neglect or refusal, order such person to make a monthly allowance for the maintenance of his father or mother, at a monthly rate as the magistrate thinks fit, and to pay the same to such person as the Magistrate may from time to time direct.Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code makes it obligatory for sons and daughters, including a married daughter, to maintain their parents.The Maintenance and Welfare of Parents Act, 2007This act aims at providing maintenance to senior citizens in the country. It is an Act to provide for more effective provisions for the maintenance and welfare of parents and senior citizens guaranteed and recognised under the Constitution and for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto (Maintenance and Welfare of Parents Act, 2007). It is a ‘go-to’ statute for providing maintenance as it applies to the whole of India except the state of Jammu and Kashmir.This Act defines a senior citizen as a person who is above 60 years of age and is a citizen of India. Under section 5(1) of this Act, any senior citizen who is also a parent is entitled to get maintenance; where “parent”, according to section 2 means “father or mother whether biological, adoptive or step father or step mother, as the case may be, whether or not the father or the mother is a senior citizen”.The Act provides provisions for maintenance of child-less senior citizens. Such citizens may be maintained by their legal heir or the person to whom the property maybe transferred after the death of such citizen.If the senior citizen or parent is incapable, any other person or a voluntary organization authorised by the senior citizen or parent can apply for maintenance on their behalf. This provision is very helpful as most of the senior citizens or parents do not have the time and energy to go around courts and tribunals.Section 24 of the act provides a punishment for those who, taking care of any senior citizen, leave the senior citizen with an intention of wholly abandoning them to place where no one can find them. Thus, this Act is very useful in protecting the dignity of our senior citizens.State government has the power under this Act to set up a maintenance tribunal in every sub-division that would have the power to decide upon the level of maintenance. All appeals from the maintenance tribunal would lie in the Appellate tribunal (established at the district level).The Act caps the maximum monthly allowance at Rs 10,000 per month. The establishment of old age homes has significantly taken off, with at least one old age home per district.Other Government Policies:Reverse Mortgages– Under such scheme the senior citizen mortgages his property to a lender in the capacity of a borrower, the lender thereby makes periodic payments to the borrower during his lifetime.New Pension scheme– This scheme enables an individual to save a certain amount throughout his working life. Health– The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare provide separate queues for older persons in hospitals for procedures of registration and clinical examination. This is in addition to the concessions offered to them in the treatment of the diseases like cardiac problems, diabetes, kidney problem, blood pressure, joint and eye problem. Travel- The Indian Railways gives 30% concessions in the ticket prices to all persons aged 60 years and above. It is 50% in case the senior citizen is a woman aged over 60 years. Other facilities like, priority for lower births, separate counter for booking (and cancelling tickets), ramps to roll in wheel chairs at the entry points (in few important stations), specially designed coaches with provisions for accommodating wheel chairs, handrails, and specially designed toilet for disabled older citizen have also been put in place. While travelling by air, most elderly persons are encouraged to board first. Besides this, the Indian Airlines provides 50% concession on purchase of economy class tickets. And, Air India has been offering discount to senior citizen aged 60 years and above on International flights. Banking– Indian government gives high rate of interests to its senior citizens on certain savings plans which are run by the post offices and other private banks. They can also avail of Income tax rebate up to an income of Rs 1.85 lakhs per annum. Housing-The Indian government provides housing facilities such as retirement homes and recreational or educational centres. These centres provide older persons with opportunities to spend their free time doing various activities. Most recreational centres have yoga clubs, fitness club, parks, spiritual session, picnic, food fests, libraries, art and craft, music classes and indoor games. It is proposed to allot 10% of the houses constructed under government schemes for the urban and rural lower income segments to the older persons on easy loan.Miscellaneous- Courts in the country accord priority to cases involving older persons and ensure their expeditious disposal.According to Sec.88-B, 88-D and 88-DDB of Income Tax Act there are discount in tax for the elderly persons.Life Insurance Corporation of India (LIC) has also been providing several scheme for the benefit of aged persons, i.e., Jeevan Dhara Yojana, Jeevan Akshay Yojana, Senior Citizen Unit Yojana, Medical Insurance Yojana. Annapurna scheme is being implemented since 2001 where 10 kgs of food grains are provided free of costs to old destitute people who are above the age of 65 years.Other Government Policies are National Policy for Older People, 1999, Scheme of Integrated Programme for Older Persons (IPOP), Indira Gandhi National Age Pension Scheme (IGNOAPS), National Programme for the Healthcare for the Elderly (NPHCE).CONCLUSIONGovernment of India has made all these provisions under various Personal laws as well as other laws and has also granted benefits through these schemes for their financial support and to maintain their dignity in these crucial years of their lives. However the implementation of these provisions is very poor and should be made stringent as there are many cases which we come across everyday of Elder Abuse and Elderly living in poor conditions without adequate love and care. This is increasing rapidly as there are no solid laws made for Elderly and with the degeneration of joint family system, dislocation of familiar bonds and loss of respect for the aged person, the family in modern times should not be thought to be a secure place for them. Thus, it should be the Constitutional duty of the State to make an Act for the welfare and extra protection of the senior citizen including palliative care. Economic Problems include such problems as loss of employment, income deficiency, and economic insecurity. Physical and Physiological Problems include health and medical problems, nutritional deficiency, and the problem of adequate housing etc. Psycho-social Problem which cover problems related with their psychological and social maladjustment as well as the problem of elder abuse etc. "

    "data": "A presidential election was held in India on Monday 17 July 2017 with the votes counted and the results announced on Thursday 20 July. President Pranab Mukherjee’s term of office was due to expire on 24 July 2017. Mukherjee declined to seek re-election.Governor of Bihar Ram Nath Kovind of the Bharatiya Janata Party had the backing of the governing National Democratic Alliance coalition, and went up against opposition candidate Meira Kumar of the Indian National Congress in the vote. Kovind secured roughly two-thirds of the votes from the electoral college of elected members of federal, state and union territory legislatures and was elected to a five-year term as President. Kovind’s term of office will begin on 25 July 2017.Kovind was born in Kanpur Dehat, Uttar Pradesh. His father was a farmer. He holds a Bachelors degree in commerce and a LLB from DAV College, (affiliated with Kanpur University). He joined the BJP in 1991.He was President of the BJP Dalit Morcha between 1998 and 2002 and President of the All-India Koli Samaj. He also served as national spokesperson of the party. He donated his ancestral home in Derapur to the RSS. He contested from Ghatampur and Bhognipur (both in Uttar Pradesh) assembly constituencies on the BJP ticket but lost both elections. He was elected and became a Rajya Sabha MP from the state of Uttar Pradesh in April 1994. He served a total of twelve years, two consecutive terms, until March 2006. As a member of parliament he served on the Parliamentary Committee for Welfare of Scheduled Castes/Tribes, Home Affairs, Petroleum and Natural Gas, Social Justice and Empowerment, Law and Justice. He also served as the chairman of the Rajya Sabha House Committee. During his career as a parliamentarian, under M.P. L.A.D. Scheme, he focused on education in rural areas by helping in construction of school buildings in Uttar Pradesh and Uttrakhand. As a member of parliament, he visited Thailand, Nepal, Pakistan, Singapore, Germany, Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom and the United States on study tours.On 8 August 2015, the President of India appointed Kovind as Governor of Bihar. On 16 August 2015, the acting Chief Justice of Patna High Court, Iqbal Ahmad Ansari, administered the oath to Kovind as the 36th Governor of Bihar. The function took place at Raj Bhawan, Patna.As Governor, he was praised for constituting a judicial commission to investigate irregularities in promotion of undeserving teachers, mis-management of funds and appointment of undeserving candidates in universitiesEligibility to be the President of The Republic of India:The following are the compulsory requirements for anyone to contest the election for the President of India: Other conditions to be fulfilled to contest:Apart from the above conditions, the nomination paper of a candidate has to be signed by at least fifty (50) eligible voters as proposers and at least fifty(50) eligible voters as second in deserving. Here the voters are the MPs & MLAs and non citizens. A voter cannot propose or second more than one candidate.The difference between a normal election & the Presidential election:The one major difference between any normal general election and the Presidential election is the differential value of votes of various electors (voters). In any normal election, the value of the vote of every citizen is the same. His/her vote is counted as one vote. But in the Presidential election, the value of the MP vote is different from the value of a MLA vote. Not just that, the value of a MLA vote from one state differs from the value of the MLA vote of another state. The value of all the votes put together is the value of the voters for the election. Before each such election, the Election Commission notifies the total value of all the votes based on vacancies etc at that point in time. The value of votes is calculated in the following manner:The value of votes of electors (voters) is basically determined on the basis of population of the States. Since population figures are dynamic and keep changing every year, it has been decided through the 84th Constitutional Amendment, that until the population figures for the first census after 2026 are published (in other words, 2031 census), the population of the States for the purpose of this calculation will mean the population as per the 1971 census. The Process for calculating the Value of MLA vote:The value of the vote of each MLA is calculated by dividing the population of the State as per 1971 Census, by the total number of elected members of the respective state assembly, and then to divide the quotient by 1000. Total Value of all members of each State Assembly is obtained by multiplying the number of seats in the Assembly by the number of votes for each member.The total value of votes of all the States is divided by the total number of elected members of Parliament (Lok Sabha 543+Rajya Sabha 233) to get the value of votes of each Member of Parliament or the MP. For 2017, this worked out to be 708. The value of a MP vote is substantially higher than the value of a MLA vote. It is in fact 3.5 times the value of a MLA’s vote in Uttar Pradesh where the value of MLA vote is maximum. A ballot paper is given to each voter with the names of the contesting candidates, green ballot paper for MPs & Pink ballot paper for MLAs. This election happens through the Single Transferable Vote (STV). Hence each voter can mark as many preferences, as the number of candidates contesting the election. These preferences for the candidates are to be marked by the voter, by marking the figures 1,2,3, 4, 5 and so on, against the names of the candidates, in the order of preference.The winning candidate has to secure the required quota of votes to be declared elected, i.e., 50% of valid first preferential votes polled +1. After the valid ballot papers are segregated from the invalid ones, the valid ballot papers are distributed among the contesting candidates on the basis of first preference marked on each of them for those candidates. The value of votes in favor of each contesting candidate is ascertained by multiplying the number of ballot papers on which the first preference is marked for him, by the value of vote which each ballot paper of a member (MP or MLA) represents. The total vote secured by each contesting candidate is then ascertained by adding together the value of votes secured by him from the MPs and the MLAs. This is the first round of counting.To ascertain whether there is a winner after the first round of counting, the value of votes credited to each contesting candidate in the first round of counting is added up to determine the total value of valid votes polled at the election. This total value is divided by two and one is added to the quotient to determine the required quota for victory (50% +1). If any of the candidates receives the required number of votes in the first round, he is declared a winner.However, even after the first round of counting, no candidate secures the required quota of votes, then the counting proceeds through a process of elimination and exclusion, whereby the candidate credited with the lowest number of first preferential votes in the first round is excluded and all his ballot papers are distributed among the remaining candidates on the basis of the second preferences marked in such ballots. The value of such transferred ballot papers will be the same as the value at which the excluded candidate received them. The ballot papers on which second preference is not marked is treated as exhausted ballot papers and shall not be further counted, even if the third or subsequent preferences are marked. This process is continued until there is a clear winner with 50% +1.

In 2017, this value was 10,98,903 (549408 for MP & 549495 for MLA). The total number of eligible voters in the 2017 election is 4896 (776 MPs & 4120 MLAs from states)."

Detention is a process where state lawfully upholds freedom of liberty of an individual either due to (pending) criminal charges being raised against the individual as part of a prosecution or to protect a person or property. Even if the person is suspected of committing an offence he or she can be detained but shall be informed the grounds of the detention[1]. As it is said that every coin has two sides, the other side of the matter is that the people who are detained do suffer a lot of mental trauma and moreover their anxiety multiplies when they do not know the period of their detention. The ones who are poor and illiterate are even in a bad condition as they lack sources to reach out to the outer world. “The defendant with means can afford to pay bail. He can afford to buy his freedom. But the poorer defendant cannot pay the price. He languishes in jail weeks, months, and perhaps even years before trial.”[2]The Supreme Court, in Lahu Shrirang Gatkal v. State of Maharashtra, has held that a blanket order of detention, without specifying the period of detention, is illegal and unbefitting. The court was considering an appeal by Lahu Shrirang Gatkal, a person who was detained under Section 3(1) of the Maharashtra Prevention of Dangerous Activities of Slumlords, Bootleggers, Drug Offenders, Dangerous Persons, Video Pirates, Sand Smugglers and Persons Engaged in Black Marketing of Essential Commodities Act, 1981 by order dated 10.10.2016 passed by the Commissioner of Police, which came to be challenged before the High Court of Bombay, bench at Aurangabad in Criminal Writ Petition No. 132 of 2017, wherein the High Court had dismissed the Writ Petition filed by the appellant. Aggrieved by the aforesaid order passed by the High Court, Lahu Shrirang Gatkal appealed before the Supreme Court to challenge his detention order.On briefing the facts it is important to mention that the appellant, Lahu Shrirang Gatkal is a constable in the Maharashtra Police Department. He is alleged to have been involved in various criminal activities and at least seven complaints have been registered against him. On 10.10.2016, the Commissioner of Police passed a detention order under Sub-section (1) of Section 3 of the Act on the notion to prevent the appellant from acting in a pre-judicial manner and to maintain the public order, but the detention order did not mention the period of the detention.The Supreme Court bench comprising Justice NV Ramana and Justice Prafulla C Pant regarded the matter of utmost concern and referring to Cherukuri Mani v. Chief Secretary Case[3], the bench observed that presumptive legislation such as the present Act needs to be given a strict and proper interpretation.Hence taking into consideration all the important issues and terms related to the matter, the appeal was allowed and the order of preventive detention dated 10.10.2016 was held to be unsustainable and accordingly set aside. The detenu i.e. Lahu Shrirang Gatkal was ordered to be set at liberty forthwith unless wanted in any other case.

    "headline": "Are Pulses Food Grains? Answers Delhi High CourtSenkumar files contempt plea accusing Nalini Netto for delay in reinstatementJUSTICE VIKRAAMJIT SEN: ADMINISTRATOR OF DDCA AS APPOINTED BY DELHI HCNew Laws Enforced from May 1 in India",
    "data": "The Delhi High Court on Monday examined whether pulses fall within the definition of “grains” for the purpose of exemption from Environment Compensation Charge (ECC).Justice Vibhu Bakhru ruled, “…there is no reason to limit the scope of the word “grains” to exclude any essential commodity falling within that classification. The word “grains” in the context of food stuffs would obviously imply “food grains” and the said term plainly includes pulses.”The petition was filed by Narela Food Processing Industries Welfare Association, seeking a clarification for the purpose of levy of ECC on the vehicles carrying pulses.Green tax, or pollution tax or environmental tax, as it is also called, is an excise duty on goods that cause environmental pollutants. According to Economic theory, charging taxes on emissions that cause pollution will lower environmental impairment in a cost-effective manner by encouraging behavioural changes in households and firms that need to decrease their pollution.The levy of ECC was mandated by the Supreme Court through an order passed in October, 2015. The Apex Court had exempted “vehicles carrying essential commodities, that is, food stuffs and oil tankers”. In view of this decision, the State had issued a notification exempting “the vehicles carrying raw vegetables, fruits, grains, milk and tankers carrying petroleum products.” The Court noted that several enactments include pulses in the definition of food grains, and observed, “The term “food grains” as is commonly understood includes pulses. The Government of India also treats pulses as a part of food grains in the data published in this regard. On the website of the Government of India – data.gov.in, the statistics pertaining to the “Agricultural production of different food grains from year 2003 to 2014 at all India level” includes data pertaining to production of pulses.” "

    "data": "The petition challenging the constitutionality of Aadhaar was heard before a 5 judges bench constituted specifically, has sought the consideration of the 9 judges bench while dealing the question of law arising out of the said matter i.e., ‘whether right to privacy is a fundamental right or not’. The honorable bench of 9 judges would take the case on 19-July-2017.Observing the importance of the referred question before the adjudication of the petition challenging Aadhaar, the bench held the necessity to review the judgments passed in the M. P. Sharma & Others v. Satish Chandra and Kharak Singh v. The State of U. P. & Others.In the Order it read,“During the course of hearing today, it has become essential for us to define if there is any right to privacy under the Indian Constitution. Determination of this question would essentially entail whether the decision recorded by this court in M P Sharma by a 8 judge bench in 1954 and by a 6 judge bench in Kharak Singh in 1962 that there is no such right is a correct expression. Before dealing with the matter this issue should be placed before a nine judge bench tomorrow”The five judge bench with CJI Khehar, Justice Chelameswar, Justice Bobde, Justice Chandrachud and Justice Abdul Nazeer heard the arguments of Attorney General KK Venugopal, counselor for the petitioners – Senior Advocates Gopal Subrmaniam, Shyam Divan and Aravind DattarEspecially to determine the existence of a right to privacy as a fundamental right, the Supreme Court 5-judge bench of Justices J. Chelameswar, S.A. Bobde and C. Nagappan decided to refer the challenges to the Aadhaar program to a constitution bench, in August 2015. In the reference order the three Judge Bench observed as follows:We are of the point that the cases closeby bring up expansive issues of significance including interpretation of the Constitution. What is at demarcation is the magnitude of the fundamental rights including that valuable and inalienable right under Article 21. At the point when the perceptions made in M.P. Sharma and Kharak Singh are to be perused truly and acknowledged as the law of this nation, the essential rights ensured under the Constitution of India and all the more especially right to liberty under Article 21 would be stripped of force and imperativeness. In the meantime, we additionally opined that the institutional uprightness and legal disciplines require that declaration made by bigger Benches of this Court can’t be disregarded by the smaller Benches without suitably clarifying the purposes behind not following the proclamations made by such bigger Benches. With due regard to all the educated Judges who rendered the ensuing judgments – where ideal to protection is stated or alluded to their Lordships worry for the freedom of individuals, we are of the unassuming sentiment that there has all the earmarks of being sure measure of evident uncertain logical inconsistency in the law pronounced by this Court.Senior Advocate Gopal Subramanium, on Wednesday, firmly contended in favor of ‘right to privacy’ as a Fundamental Right before the mammoth nine-Judge Constitutional Bench. It was submitted by Mr. Subramanium that, “The concept of privacy is embedded in liberty as well as honour of a person,” Appearing for the Petitioners, he argued that the right to privacy is recognizable as one of the Fundamental Right in the ambit of Article 21 of the Constitution. This position, he submitted, has been the settled position of law since the overturning of the decision in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, 1950 SCR 88, by way of judgments in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India, (1970) 1 SCC 248 and Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248Mr. Subramanium further submitted that the precedent made in the case of M.P. Sharma & Ors. v. Satish Chandra & Ors. , 1954 SCR 1077 cannot be taken as an authority for the proposition that there is no right to privacy in Part III of the Constitution. “…the ratio of the judgment in M.P. Sharma (Supra) merely observed that there is no right to privacy located in Article 20(3) of the Constitution; it did not extinguish a general right to privacy. This arose in the context of searches in a criminal investigation and whether the same amounted to a violation of the right in Article 20(3),” he explained.It was, in this manner, presented that the dependence set by the Attorney General on the choices in MP Sharma and Kharak Singh is not any more reasonable. Thereafter, it was submitted by the Petitioner’s counselor,“It is submitted that the right to privacy invariably means the inviolability of the person. The expression ‘person’ includes the body as well as the inviolate personality. It is submitted that privacy really is intended to indicate the realm of inviolable sanctuary that most of us sense in our beings. It refers to spatial sanctity, freedom in decisional autonomy, informational privacy as well as the ability to freely develop one’s personality and exercise discretion and judgment. Privacy is a part of personhood and is therefore a natural right. This is why the natural right is not conferred but only recognized by the Constitution.”The Bench comprises of Chief Justice JS Khehar, Justice Chelameswar, Justice SA Bobde, Justice RK Agarwal, Justice RF Nariman, Justice AM Sapre, Justice DY Chandrachud, Justice SK Kaul and Justice Abdul Nazeer.

    "data": "The Attorney-General of India is the Chief Legal Advisor to the Government of India and its primary lawyer in the Supreme Court of India. He is the highest Law Officer in the country. He is usually a highly respected Senior Advocate of the court, and is appointed by the ruling Government. The office of the Attorney-General was created by the Constitution of India. The Attorney-General of India is appointed by the President of India under Article 76(1) of the Constitution and holds office during the pleasure of the President.Unlike the United States, in India, the Attorney-General does not have executive authority and is not a government minister; those functions are performed by the law minister.The Attorney-General is assisted by the Solicitor General of India and several additional Solicitors General. The solicitor general is the second law officer of the state after the Attorney-General. The solicitor General is subordinate to the Attorney-General of India. The solicitor General is himself assisted by four Additional Solicitors General for India. Unlike the Attorney-General, Solicitor General does not tender legal advice to the Government of India. His workload is confined to appear in courts on behalf of the Union of India.Article 76 of Indian Constitution describes the appointment and functions of the Attorney- General. Under Article 76(1) The President shall appoint a person who is the citizen of India and is qualified to be appointed a Judge of the Supreme Court to be Attorney-General of India.Under Article 76(2) the duties of the Attorney-General are described as follows:Under Article 76(3) the Rights of the Attorney-General are described as follows:Under Article 76(4) the Attorney-General shall hold office during the pleasure of the President i.e. no term is fixed in the Constitution.

If Attorney-General wants to resign he can do so by submitting his resignation to the President.The Attorneys General for India since Independence are listed below: As the first and longest serving attorney general of India, MC Setalvad was in the thick of resolving the nation’s constitutional dilemmas. He appeared for the government in a host of important and, at times, controversial cases. He was also involved with the Radcliffe Tribunal for demarcation of the Indo-Pak border and several UN proceedings on Kashmir, assignments that required the deft touch of a legal eagle and the principles of a man of conviction. He chaired the first Law Commission of independent India, in which capacity he not just advised the government on crucial reforms and legislation but also created a framework for the Commissions future functioning.He was the Chief Legal Advisor of India in 1989 and then again during Atal Bihari Vajpayee government in the year 1998. He has had the rare distinction of holding the highest law posts under the Constitution besides being Additional Solicitor General and Solicitor General of India from 1977 to 1980. He has held several offices in organizations of national and international repute.Milon Kumar Banerji was an Indian jurist who was Attorney General of India from 1992 to 1996 and again from 2004 to 2009. He was also Solicitor General from 1986 to 1989. He died on 20 July 2010. Banerji, during his 50year career, had appeared in the Supreme Court and various High Courts and was associated with a number of important cases. During the Narasimha Rao government, the day he took over as the Attorney-General on November 24, 1992, he had appeared in the Ram Janambhoomi case and told the Supreme Court that the situation had reached a boiling point and any inaction would make it irreversible. The judgment in the case, upholding the validity of the Acquisition of Certain Areas in Ayodhya Act, 1993, was another landmark in his career. He had argued cases involving issues of Election Commission’s power and the citizenship of Congress president Sonia Gandhi.The 3 year tenure of the 14th Attorney-General of India Mukul Rohatgi ended on 18 June 2017 who was formally appointed by the President Pranab Mukherjee as with effect from 19 June 2014 a month after the Modi Government was elected. Mukul Rohatgi is a Senior Advocate at the Supreme Court of India. During Vajpayee Government, in 1999, he has also served as the Additional Solicitor General of India. Rohatgi, son of former Delhi High Court judge Justice Awadh Behari Rohatgi, has represented Gujarat government in the Supreme Court in the 2002 Gujarat riots and fake encounter death cases, including the Best Bakery and Zahira Sheikh cases. Besides some of these high-profile cases handled by him, Rohatgi had also appeared on behalf of big corporates in the 2G scam trial. As a corporate lawyer, Rohatgi had represented Anil Ambani in the Supreme Court in the gas dispute case between the Ambani brothers. He had also represented Italian embassy in the apex court after India arrested two Italian marines in 2012 for shooting dead two Kerala fishermen. During his 3 year stint, he has represented the centre in Supreme Court in many crucial cases including Triple Talaq matter, in which the judgement is reserved. He has argued many contentious matters like the challenge to The National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) Act on the appointment of judges to the higher judiciary. He also defended the government, which was in a tussle with the Supreme Court Collegium of judges over the appointments. He has also advanced the government’s stand of defending the policy of Aadhaar, in which the issue of Right to Privacy has been raised and is pending before the apex court. As a top law officer, Rohatgi had defended the government’s policy of demonetisation.His tenure came to an end on 18 June 2017 and the Union Cabinet approved the extension of his term as the Attorney-General of India on 3 June 2017, until further notice. He however had asked the Central Government not to consider him for reappointment or extension. A week later the notification of the extension of his tenure Rohatgi wrote to the government, stating his desire to discontinue as Attorney-General and return to private practice instead. He said that the extension given to him by the government earlier this month was adhoc till further orders, as it was done when Prime Minister Narendra Modi was on a visit to Russia. “So, the government has to take a call on my decision,” he said. This gave rise to various speculations regarding the successor of Mukul Rohatgi who will be appointed as the current Attorney-General of India.According to the recent news KK Venugopal is likely to succeed Mukul Rohatgi as Attorney-General of India. The 86-year-old looks set to return as a law officer after a gap of 40 years. Venugopal, who started appearing in the Supreme Court in the early 1960s, while based in erstwhile Madras, was designated as a senior advocate by the Supreme Court in 1972. Five years later, after the end of Emergency, he was invited by the Janata Party government led by Morarji Desai to become an additional solicitor general that warranted shifting base from Madras to Delhi.What Venugopal will bring to the attorney general’s office is his unmatched experience of 50 years practice in the Supreme Court. He has seen the growth of litigation in the highest court and the inconvenience litigants from southern and northeastern states face in approaching the apex court for justice. A stickler for rules, Venugopal is often sought out by the Supreme Court when it faces tricky constitutional questions. He believes in hard work first and court craft later.Venugopal, apart from being involved in many important cases before constitutional benches of the Supreme Court, spent more than six years as amicus curiae in the infamous 2G spectrum scam case relating to irregular allotment of bandwidth to telecom operators during the tenure of A. Raja as telecom minister in UPA-1. He assisted the Supreme Court in monitoring investigations by the CBI and the Enforcement Directorate. BY:ADITI MARWAHA He acts as the First Law Officer of the Country. He shall give advice to the Government of India upon such legal matters which are referred by the President. He performs functions of legal nature that are assigned by the President. He discharges the functions conferred by the Constitution or any other law. He appears on behalf of the Government of India in all cases in the Supreme Court in which the Government of India is concerned. He represents the Government of India in any reference made by the President to the Supreme Court under Article 143 of the Constitution. He appears in any High Court in any case in which The Government of India is concerned. He enjoys all the privileges and immunities enjoyed by the MP’s. In the performance of his duties the Attorney-General shall have right to audience in all courts in the territory of India. He has the right to speak and take part in the proceedings of both Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha or Joint Sitting of both without the right to vote.

    "data": "On and off we see advocates being held responsible for the delay in the cases; however we fail to take note that the litigants can also be responsible for the delay. In the case of Moddus Media Pvt. Ltd the High Court of Delhi has said that the “litigants need to be vigilant, and can’t put entire blame on advocate to get delay condoned”.In the given matter the Appellant-company was rapped for their lack of vigilance in conducting a suit for recovery of money, and their subsequent conduct in blaming the Counsel for the delay in filing an Appeal.It was observed by Justice Vinod Goel that “The litigant owes a duty to be vigilant of his rights and is also expected to be equally vigilant about the judicial proceedings pending in the court of law against him or initiated at his instance. The litigant cannot be permitted to cast the entire blame on the Advocate. It appears that the blame is being attributed on the Advocate with a view to get the delay condoned and avoids the decree. After filing the civil suit or written statement, the litigant cannot go off to sleep and wake up from a deep slumber after passing a long time as if the court is storage of the suits filed by such negligent litigants. Putting the entire blame upon the advocate and trying to make it out as if they were totally unaware of the nature or significance of the proceedings is a theory put forth by the appellant/applicant/defendant company, which cannot be accepted and ought not to have been accepted”.The Court was hearing an application filed under Section 5 of the Limitation Act, 1963, read with Section 151 of the Code of Civil Procedure, seeking condonation of delay of 400 days in filing an appeal against an August, 2015 judgment passed by the Additional District Judge.Justice Goel, rapped the litigants for placing the blame entirely on the Counsel, and observed, the appellant is not a simple or rustic illiterate person but a Private Limited Company managed by educated businessmen, who know very well where their interest lies. The litigant is to be vigilant and pursue his case diligently on all the hearings. If the litigant does not appear in the court and leaves the case at the mercy of his counsel without caring as to what different frivolous pleas/defences being taken by his counsel for adjournments is bound to suffer. If the litigant does not turn up to obtain the copies of judgment and orders of the court so as to find out what orders are passed by the court is liable to bear the consequences.”The Court opined that Moddus was not “serious at all” regarding the litigation, as it had other remedies at its disposal such as taking services of another lawyer or appearing in person. It further noted discrepancies in the allegations levelled against the Counsel before the Court, when compared with the complaint addressed to the Bar Council of India. The Court thereby concluded that it was the Applicant that was “careless and negligent” in its approach, and refused to condone the delay.The increasing number of unrepresented litigants poses challenges for the courts. In responding to these challenges it is essential to have regards to the fundamental principle that the courts must be and must be seen fair to the unrepresented litigants. But equally important, the courts must be fair to the other parties in the case, including those that are legally represented. The courts have to be conscious of this, particularly in cases where on party is represented but the other is not.The courts could guide litigants on matter like forms completion but the courts could not cross the line and act as a lawyer for the unrepresented litigant through giving legal advice or acting as an advocate.As we move forward, it is of great importance that our community continues to exercise strong vigilance on all matters concerning the law.Such vigilance must be exercised by all, by those who have been entrusted to govern as well as by the public, by lawyers who have a special role to play as well as by non-lawyers. And such vigilance must be exercised not only in relation to the enforcement and interpretation of laws but also, in relation to the formulation and enactment of new laws.By:Ruth Desai"

    "data": "The Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act, 1958 came into force on September 1st, 1958. On tracing the history of this Act, it is found that the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Ordinance was promulgated by the then Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow to curtail the Quit India Movement. Under the Disturbed Areas (Special Courts) Act, 1976, once an area is declared as disturbed, the AFSP Act, 1958 is enforced in that area, giving the army special powers. This Act is enforced in 7 North- East states and Jammu and Kashmir. The Act was withdrawn from Punjab in the year 1997 and from Chandigarh in the year 2012. It gives immunity to the armed forces from legal proceedings. In order to bring stability in an insurgent area, the armed forces have to operate in uncongenial surroundings. These forces operate in unfavorable situations like for instance the population is not co-operative or setting up training and base camps in the forests, hills or any other place where there is a risk of insurgency or deterioting law and order situation at any moment. They have to carry out their duties day in and day out in such areas to combat anti- national operations avoiding collateral damages and life of the civilians.It goes without saying that an army personnel has to be prepared to deal with perceived adversary which does not give time to take orders from authorities otherwise they would be long dead. This necessitates of granting certain special powers to them. The Act is in existence for the above enumerated reasons and many more. The powers given to them can be summarized as-Let’s have a look over few case laws followed by instances putting a clear picture of the scenario that the controversial law has created-Kinjinbou Liangmei vs. Union of India and ors [1]In this case, Mr. Kinjinbou Liangmei, the petitioner prayed for compensation to be paid for the death of his son Mr. S. Philip. Philip was a class 7th student who was arrested by the three Assam riffles on 7th May, 1992 They slapped, blind folded, undressed, hands were twisted and tied behind, several boot kicks, beaten with lathi, burnt his chest with cigarette butts, made him stand the whole night with scanty food till 11th May, 1992 before they handed him over to Kangpokpi the Police Station. They violated Section 4 and 5 of the AFSP Act, 1958 and failed to protect the personal liberty of the citizen as they are the custodian of law and order.Smt. Khumanthem Ongbi Pangabam Ningol Ibemhal Devi vs. State of Manipur and ors. [2]The petitioner is the mother of Jayendra Singh who was arrested by the personnel’s of 16th Sikh regiment along with his friend Sapam Boby on 27th January, 1998. The next day they were handed over to the Singjam Police Station along with the report alleging they are member of the banned UNLF. On 1st February, 1998 the Jayendra Singh died in hospital due to rental, lung and heart failure. The post mortem revealed it was due to blunt multiple force on the body. He was given electric shock to his private parts and beaten with a stick on his buttock by the army personnel.Smt. Kangujam Ongbi Thoibi Devi vs. State of Manipur and ors. [3]In the instant case a 15 year old boy named Ojit Singh was succumbed to custodial death. He was arrested on 16th February, 1997 and handed over to the police on 19th February, 1997. He confessed to be an active member of PREPAK. He tried to escape and hit against a laterite wall and when he picked himself up he again fell in a ditch. He was given medical treatment and admitted to JN Hospital on 20th February, 1997 where he died. The post mortem report reveals that there were 16 external injuries and serious internal injuries like congested heart and small hemorrhagic spots on different surface of pericardium and heart. Due to carelessness and not affording proper treatment resulted in the custodial death of Ojit Singh.This Act has been criticized by several sections of society for being a draconian law. The army personnel’s are using excessive force than what they are granted, thereby mocking at our democratic process. The purpose of AFSPA is to restore normalcy in the disturbed areas but has failed miserably. More and more resentment and complaints for its withdrawal coming forward by the people and various committee. Numerous protests and mass campaigns are a result of grave human rights violations, rape, torture, murder, raids, sexual harassments, extortion, and wrongful confinement of the citizens in those areas. Irom Sharmila, also known as Iron Lady of Manipur began her fasting on 5th November, 2000. This was a sign of protest for killing 10 people who were waiting at the bus stop of Malom by the Assam Riffles soldiers. This cold blooded incident made her fast for 16 years where she demanded speedy inquiry into the tragic incident and removal of the Act in the state. Out of several atrocities by the army one of the sensational issue was of the Thangjam Manorama case. She was picked from her home at night by the Assam Rifles. After torturing and raping, later they shot 6 bullets into her body. Her mutilated body was discovered 3kms from her home. There was widespread protest in which 33 naked women shouted before the headquarters of the Assam Riffles- “Indian Army rape us too”. This short piece of legislation legalizes any perpetration by the armed forces functioning in the states. Explicit immunity is thus assured leading to gross violation of human rights and the likes. [4] In 2012, a PIL was filed by the Extra Judicial Executions Victims Family Association to inquire into nearly 1700 extra judicial killings in the name of encounter. After getting involved in these crimes the army takes shelter under the umbrella of the controversial act.The Supreme Court on April 18th, 2017 while hearing three rape cases against the armed forces said, “Do you have people in the army who rape? It is an alleged gang rape in uniform – an aggravated form of crime.” In one of the cases two soldiers raped a 13 year old girl on 2003 where the army men gave a clean chit to their men and state government denied to order a probe to which the Court said to Manipur government, “Is there a tacit understanding between you (the state) and them (the army) that you won’t enter their area to conduct any sort of probe? Here is a 13-year-old girl who worked in a rubber farm. There was no allegation that she was an insurgent. Two people come and rape her. She narrates her ordeal to her mother and a sister and then commits suicide. Have you decided that let army come and rape anyone, what can we do?” and the other case was of Thangjam Manorama. [5]It is to be brought into notice that to tackle the insurgency or terrorists the government has several acts in existence such as the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967, TADA, 1985. The provision to kill, shoot, search, arrest violates Article 21 of Constitution (Right to life). The arbitrary use of power instead of bringing down the insurgency rates, it has promoted brutal crimes. The protection from legal proceeding is not in conformity with the principles of criminal justice system. It is due to non-application of the law, the armed forces are their own judge and jury. It should be left on the judiciary to determine an act as frivolous or not which will further act as a check on the misuse of the powers given to the army. There is no definition of “disturbed area” and once declared it is not subject to judicial review. This definitely need to be repealed. People have accused the army for not adopting safeguards while implementing the act. Proper guidelines regarding the safeguards has to be laid down. The state has the right and duty to protect its citizens and the country from the insurgents but at the same time it doesn’t have the right to take away the life or violate a human right unlawfully. Rethinking and restructuring of the act is necessary for achieving its goal.References By:Snigdha Panigrahi4th year, B.A.LL.B (Hons.)University Law College.Section 4 of the Act provides to shoot or fire any person who acts against the law only after “such due warning as he may consider necessary”.They are empowered to destroy the armed gang’s hideout or any such shelter and arrest anyone without warrant who has committed or suspected of committing a cognizable offence.They can enter or search any premises to arrest or recover a wrongfully restrained person or stolen property or arms, ammunitions or explosive property which has been kept unlawfully in such premises.Section 5 provides that after immediate arrest under this Act, he has to be handed over to the Officer in charge at the nearest police station.Section 6 offers protection by forbidding any prosecution or legal proceedings to be instituted against them with the previous sanction of the Central Government.Once the government declares an areas as “disturbed”, it is not subject to judicial review.https://www.legalcrystal.com/case/127248/kinjinbou-liangmei-vs-union-indiahttps://www.legalcrystal.com/case/133099/smt-khumanthem-ongbi-pangabam-ningol-ibemhal-devi-vs-state-manipurhttps://www.legalcrystal.com/case/135772/smt-kangujam-ongbi-thoibi-devi-vs-state-manipurhttps://feminisminindia.com/2015/04/22/afspa-the-armys-right-to-rape-from-manorama-to-karbi/https://thewire.in/126186/rape-security-forces-afspa/"

    "data": "INTRODUCTION:-India and Pakistan two neighbouring countries with countless history. Which was once one and undivided but today divided not only by border but also from heart. From cricket to Kashmir these two countries don’t see eye to eye. Scholars, foreign policy analysts, and journalists focusing on Indo-Pak relations have long described these relations as “intractable”[2]. Both the countries have alleged each other of doing many illegal things from history to the present time. In this article the critical relationship between these two countries will be analysed thoroughly.A TIMELINE OF THE CONFLICT:-It all started in 1947. A great nation India was divided into two countries namely republic of India and Islamic Republic of Pakistan. The relationship of both the country is such that the talk of peace, trade takes place with parallel threat of war. They have fought four wars; still the relationship between both the countries is hostile. Since the early 1990s the insurgency in Kashmir and various terrorist activities in India have affected the relationship between both the countries. This conflict with regular violent terrorist attacks has resulted in a vicious cycle of mistrust, bellicosity and conflict.2001-02At the point when five terrorists having a place with Lashkar-e-Toiba and Jaish-e-Mohammed assaulted the Indian Parliament expanding on 13 December 2001, the Home Minister of India LK Advani obviously pointed a finger at the ‘neighbouring nation and the psychological militant association dynamic there’. When the Kaluchak assaults occurred on 14 May 2002, in which 31 fighters and their families were slaughtered by psychological militants having a place with Lashkar-e-Toiba, the Indian armed force had as of now been prepared and the armed force units were sitting in fight developments anticipating last requests to go to war[3].2008On 26th November 2008 Mumbai terrorist attack took place. India’s then External Affairs Minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed that India may enjoy military strikes against the preparation camps of fear based oppressor equips in Pakistan. India did not prepare its troops[4].2015On 27 July 2015 three fear mongers assaulted a transport and a police headquarters in Gurdaspur area of Punjab, slaughtering seven individuals. The main data that the exploring organizations could accumulate was that the fear based oppressors were “Muslim” and they appeared to have originated from Pakistan, extricating information from the GPS recuperated from them, which did not demonstrate any waypoints past the fringe. The case, other than lacking adequate confirmation to consider a specific association or state mindful, got an uncommon media dull in India. 2016Most as of late on 02 January 2016, fear based oppressors assaulted the Air Force Station in Pathankot with a point of focusing on India’s ‘high-esteem resources, for example, helicopters and air ships stopped in the station. An operation that endured almost three days brought about each of the six fear based oppressors’ dead alongside seven security work force and a regular citizen. The Indian knowledge offices connected the psychological militants to Jaish-e-Mohammed[5]. These are the major five attacks that took place and where Pakistan was allegedly involved.Currently the situation between these countries is also not good. The cold war between these two countries continues with continuing peace talks just to appease the domestic audience at both the countries.The tensions between these two countries worsen over the arrest and death sentence of former Indian naval officer Kulbhushan jadav[6]. India continuously requested for the consular access of Kulbhusan Jadav bu Pakistan denied 13 times. Currently the case is in ICJ Hague[7]. The continuos firing on the LOC also is a reason for this ongoing rivalry between these two countries. However the main who suffer because of this rivalry are the casualties.CONCLUSION:-This cold war not only stands as a threat to these countries but also it’s a threat to the whole world at large because both these countries have nuclear weapons. The behavioural pattern of both the countries show that the day is not far when one of these country won’t use the weapon for mass destruction against the other. Pendulum like back and forth antagonism continues between these two countries. This continuous animosity between these two countries show that this kind of hypocrisy has became a political practice. When this will end no one knows and how many more innocent lives will be sacrificed that also depends on the fate of these two countries.

GNCTD: UNFAIR TO EXPECT CHILDREN ORPHANED DUE TO COVID TO PROCURE DOCUMENTS FOR AVAILING BENEFITS UNDER WELFARE SCHEMES: DELHI HC",
    "data": "Abortion is the last resort in extreme cases of danger and distress- this is the general notion of most of the people but the apex court is still in dilemma on this issue when it comes to give permission to abort a 20+ week foetus case. Supreme Court has given conflicting decisions on abortion cases which have crossed the 20 week cap, in some of the cases the court has permitted to abort while in others it had not.SC is again up with such a case where a 33 year old Kolkata woman Sarmishtha Chakraborty, through a writ petition claims to seek permission to abort her 23 week old foetus because it has been lately discovered that the child is suffering with a congenital disorder called Tetrology of Fallot which is a combination of four impairments in the heart. This cardiac ailment it near to untreatable and the multiple open heart surgeries may not yield any result as this has been confirmed by various doctors at Apollo Gleneagles Hospital in Kolkata.Advocate Sneha Mukherjee who appeared from the petitioner contends that it was during a foetal echocardiography conducted on 25th May that it was detected that the foetus suffered from this cardiac ailment and that it would be difficult to cure and improve the condition of the child even after multiple open heart surgeries. Also it would be extremely disquieting and painful for the parents to see their child’s poor quality of life.The case has once again engender the debate around the Medical Termination of Pregnancy (MTP) Act, 1971 that legalises abortion only under the 20-week ceiling with an exception being section 5 of the Act, which allows abortion after 20 weeks in case it “is immediately necessary to save the life of the pregnant woman.” Mrs. Chakraborty mentions the fact that certain tests and subsequent foetal echocardiography confirmed the disorder but because she had crossed the 20 week cap, she was denied abortion and was forced to continue with her pregnancy. Sneha Mukherjee, the advocate for the petitioner also contends that the provisions of the MTP Act, 1971 have ceased to be reasonable now in view of long march in technology and that it is perfectly safe for a woman to abort even up to 26th week and thereafter.Taking note of the condition of the petitioner the Supreme Court’s Vacation Bench consisting of Justices D.Y.Chandrachud and Sanjay Kishan Kaul decided to refer the matter to a Medical Board on Friday of the following week and based on their findings through medical reports and some fresh tests the board will prepare a report early by next week the decision would be pronounced as soon as possible for the relief of the mother and her family. The court has also asked the state government to suggest a panel of doctors from Kolkata government hospitals, who could examine the woman and her foetus at short notice and give a report to the court suggesting possibility and advisability of termination of pregnancy.So a very big question mark still persists on the efficiency of the top notched officials and law makers who have kept the bill of 2014 that proposes to extend the legally permissible period for termination of pregnancy to 24 weeks still pending in the Parliament. There has recently been certain issues related to abortion of foetus which have crossed the 20 week cap since it is only after 20 weeks that certain diseases are detected and the court has arbitrarily given its decisions which differ from case to case and it thus leads to a lot of mental dismay and anguish to the person so concerned. The need of the hour is that since law is dynamic it needs to mould itself according to changing time and trends and make it fruitful for the people. “The time has come for us to review the law which restricts termination of pregnancy after 20 weeks. If the mother feels that she is not mentally ready to take care of a child with incurable cardiac problems or Down syndrome, she should have the right to terminate the pregnancy at a later stage” as said by Dr Devi Shetty renowned cardiac surgeon and Padma Bhushan awardee.

    "data": " The Taj Mahal Palace in Mumbai has become the first Indian building to be trademarked, under the Trademarks Act 1999, for its architectural design.Part of the Taj Hotels Resorts and Palaces, this hotel is considered the flagship property of the group and contains 560 rooms and 44 suites. There is some 1,500 staff including 35 butlers. From a historical and architectural point of view, the two buildings that make up the hotel, the Taj Mahal Palace, and the Tower are two distinct buildings, built at different times and in different architectural designs.This makes the 114-year-old building the first in the country to get such a registration. The hotel, which has been a defining structure of Mumbai’s skyline, has joined the elite and small club of trademarked properties in the world which includes the Empire State Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and Sydney Opera House.The Trade Marks Act provides, inter alia, for registration of service marks, filing of multiclass applications, increasing the term of registration of a trademark to ten years as well as recognition of the concept of well-known marks, etc. The Indian judiciary has been proactive in the protection of trademarks, and it has extended the protection under the trademarks law to Domain Names as demonstrated in landmark cases of Tata Sons Ltd. v. Manu Kosuri & Ors, [90 (2001) DLT 659] and Yahoo Inc. v. Akash Arora [1999 PTC 201].India, being a common law country, follows not only the codified law, but also common law principles, and as such provides for infringement as well as passing off actions against violation of trademarks. Section 135 of the Trade Marks Act recognizes both infringement as well as passing off actions.India recognizes the concept of the “Well-known Trademark” and the “Principle of Trans Border Reputation”. A well-known Trademark in relation to any goods or services means a mark that has become so to the substantial segment of the public, which uses such goods or receives such services such that the use of such a mark in relation to other goods and services is likely to be taken as indicating a connection between the two marks.We have done this to protect the distinctiveness of the building,” said Rajendra Misra, general counsel of Indian Hotels Company (IHCL), which runs the Taj Mahal Palace. This property is the flagship of the company contributing a significant portion to its Rs 2,391 crore revenues.“Now-a-days, most of the hotels are cookie-cutters. There are not many which are designed differently,” said Misra, adding that it took the company seven months to get the structure registered. With IHCL trademarking the building, nobody can now use Taj Mahal Palace’s images for commercial purposes without paying the company a licensing fee. Currently a couple of stores sell merchandise like photo frames and cufflinks with the hotel’s pictures on them. In the recent past, the trademarked Empire State Building dragged a New York resident to court for using its image as a beer logo.Taj Mahal Palace Hotel was specifically chosen by Lashkar-e-Taiba for an attack so that it will be “striking a blow against a symbol of Indian wealth and progress”. The hotel was attacked on 26 November 2008, during which material damage occurred, including the destruction of the hotel’s roof in the hours following. Hostages were taken during the attacks, and at least 167 people were killed, including many foreigners.Below is the procedure for the registration of trademark in India. By:Ritu Jagwani"

    "data": "On 20th June, 2017, After Sahara failed to pay the requisite Rs 5,000 crore, on April 17, the court had also decided to auction Sahara’s crown jewel — Aamby valley that is valued at Rs 34,000 crore. Roy’s pleas to prevent the auctioning of this jewel fell on deaf ears as a three judge bench had fixed the fair market price and instructed the Bombay High Court — the official liquidator — ‘to proceed with the formalities of auction by preparing the draft terms and conditions and other formalities’ of more than 8,000 acre property.On Monday, Sibal revealed that Sahara had managed to sell off one of its three international hotels — London’s Grosvenor Hotel. GH Equity UK Limited, UK based firm, bought the property for GBP 575 million.He was later given bail in 2016 after he told judges that he would furnish two cheques totaling about 2000 crores-one by June and other by July. Mr Roy was first granted a four-week parole on May 6, 2016, to attend his mother’s funeral. Thereafter, his parole has been extended repeatedly by the top court.A bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and Ranjan Gogoi considered the submissions of senior advocate Kapil Sibal, appearing for Roy, that Rs. 790.18 have been already been deposited with the SEBI-Sahara account and 10 more working days be granted for submission of the remainder, reported the Press Trust of India. Last month, annoyed over non-payment of dues, the Supreme Court said “enough is enough” and decided to auction Sahara’s Aamby Valley Hill City Estate near Pune, which is reportedly worth Rs. 34,000 crores and spread over 10,000 acres land.Subrata Roy who is the founder and chairman of the Sahara India, an Indian conglomerate with diversified businesses and ownership interests that include London’s Grosvenor House, New york’s Plaza Hotel, Amby Valley City and Force India.

He was eventually arrested on 28 February 2014 by Uttar Pradesh police on Supreme Court’s warrant, in a dispute with Market Regulator – SEBI; hence he failed to appear at the court. In a statement after the arrest, his lawyer said Mr. Roy’s 92-year-old mother was in poor health and needed “her eldest son” by her side, andAs he has failed to appear in the court during the ongoing legal battle, Mr. Roy has been in custody in the Tihar Jail, Delhi, since 4 March 2014 and his bail plea has been rejected by the Supreme Court of India.Sahara was allowed to sell a part of its assets in India to raise part of the money in question. He was granted interim bail by Supreme Court of India for the same on 26 March 2014 on condition of depositing Rs 10,000 crore with the market regulator SEBI.His deposit of 10,000 crore has not been made and Roy is still in jail. As of August 2014, Roy was trying to sell some of his hotel properties to raise enough money. Roy was granted his first bail for four weeks to perform the last rites for his passed mother, which was later extended to the 24th of October. By:Shalu SharmaSharda University, Greater Noida"

    "data": "Amit Shah, president of the Bharatiya Janata Party announced Bihar Governor Ram Nath Kovind as the NDA’s candidate for the upcoming presidential elections July 2017. 71 year old a lawyer- turned- politician Ram Nath Kovind, whose choice as the BJP-led NDA’s presidential candidate is being seen as a political masterstroke.The reason many parties would not like to oppose a dalit being elected to the country’s highest office because:- As an advocate, Kovind took the lead in providing free legal aid to weaker sections, especially the SC/ST women, and poor and needy girls under the supervision of free legal aid society. MR. Kovind is also known for his work in the field of education. He has served as member on the board of the Dr. BR Ambedkar Uniersity, Lucknow. He was also a member of the board of governors of the Institute Of Management, Kolkata.Kovind has always been a low-profile leader. He was not even among the names doing the rounds for the presidency. Interestingly, in the 2014 Lok Sabha polls, he wanted to contest from Orai (SC) but he did not get a ticket. He was a little annoyed and the party then appointed him governor of Bihar, and with the announcement of his candidature, the BJP’s worries ahead of the next Lok Sabha polls are quite clear: with Mulayam-Akhilesh Yadav’s Samajwadi Party (SP), the Mayawati-led Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) and Sonia Gandhi’s Congress clearly showing an inclination to fight the elections jointly, the BJP knows such a coalition may weaken its prospects in UP. With BJP leaders, including Chief Minister Adityanath already wooing Dalits, Kovind’s elevation is expected to give the party’s fortunes a further boost.Led by Amit Shah, BJP is undoubtedly witnessing its most glorious time, as the party currently has over 280 MPs in the Lok Sabha, 56 MPs in Rajya Sabha and a whopping 1382 MLAs in total in Legislative Assemblies. With the formidable presence, the total of party’s electoral votes, along with allies, sums up to around 5,24,920 (Data: Hindustan Times) – only 24, 522 short of what is required.For the marginal electoral gap, the party may turn up to a number of options available. While BSP and Odisha-based BJD have already announced their support, JD(U) might also extend its support. The party may also seek help from AIADMK or DMK – parties dominating Tamil Nadu. BJP is not aligned with any of them yet. A champion of the scheduled caste, scheduled tribe, OBC, minority and women’s rights from his student days, Kovind is the present Governor of Bihar. A former president of the BJP Dalit Morcha (1998-2002), Kovind has also served as a national spokesperson of the party. He was also the president of the All-India Koli Samaj. Kovind became an Advocate-on-Record of the Supreme Court of India in 1978. He practised in the Delhi High Court and the Supreme Court for about 16 years until 1993. In Parliament, Kovind was a member of many important committees, especially the parliamentary committee on the welfare of scheduled castes/tribes, the parliamentary panel on social justice and empowerment and the committee on law and justice.

    "data": "In the present society we see many people committing suicide for reasons unknown to their family even and if these cases come in the light of the public, the reasons remain unidentified or not reported. Here is one such story where the cause of the suicide was assumed to have been a murder. After so many judgments being laid down related to the cases of suicide and honor killing here is another unique judgment laid down by the Supreme Court which set aside the conviction and life sentence of a man who had unfortunately survived while committing suicide in order to preserve their love. A landmark case of Satish Nirankari v State of Rajasthan proved that if the circumstances go wrong, your sacrife for love can turn into a blame to kill your lover.Two lovers, Satish Nirankari and Pooja, belonging to different castes, decide to end their lives by consuming poison. Both of them tried to do so by consuming copper sulphate, though the quantity taken by Satish was lesser as compared to Pooja. They did so because the society and their blood relations refused to accept this pious feeling and they felt ending this god gifted life easier than surviving in this cruel world. Unluckily Satish survived in the suicide attempt, whereas Pooja died. After thisSatish Nirankari was found guilty, both by the Trial Court as well as the High Court of Rajasthan for the offence of murder, under section 302 of Indian Penal Code and attempt to commit suicide under section 309 as he has agreed regarding the consumption of copper sulphate at a house in an under-construction building in Jaipur. The act of Pooja hanging her, after consuming poison, led the courts to find Satish guilty of murder.However Satish convinced the trial court that they did so as the girls family was not agreeing to their marriage. He also added that after consuming copper sulphate Pooja’s health deteriorated and he tried his best to seek help from neighbours, but found her hanging when he returned. He rushed her to the hospital but destiny has already decided something else and she died on the way. The Supreme Court, however, found him non guilty as the threat by their families could be seen and they have been left with no option rather than suicide. “If, in the process, the victims survived, and tried to seek medical help for himself and the deceased, as in the instant case, he could not to be held guilty of murder”, the SC held.The top court noted that the woman might have first “unwillingly” agreed to go by her parents’ wish but later she apparently changed her mind which appeared from the scene of the incident where garlands, bangles and vermilion were found. It was further observed that the woman might have told her lover that due to resistance from her family, she would not marry him.The court noted that the victim and the accused were in love with each other and the woman’s father had testified in the court that due to caste differences, his family had refused to give their nod to the couple for marriage. The criminal appeal filed in 2007 by Satish Nirankari against his conviction and sentence was finally allowed by the Supreme Court bench of Justice A.K Sikiri and Ashok Bhushan.The judgment, authored by justice Sikri, conceded that the phenomenon of a girl sacrificing her love and accepting decisions of her parents, even though unwillingly, is common in this country. “It also happens in love that when a man is not able to get a girl whom he wants to marry, he may go to the extent of killing her as he does not want to see her alliance with any other person. This might be the motive in the mind of appellant. However, whether events turned in this way is anybody guesses as no evidence of this nature has surfaced. It is not even possible for the prosecution to state any such things as whatever actually happened was only known to two persons, one of whom is dead and other is in dock”.The bench observed that criminal cases cannot be decided on the basis of hypothesis and acquitted the man holding that the prosecution has not been able to prove his guilt beyond reasonable doubt.Sarcastically our law allows inter-caste marriage but has no provision to protect people who dare to marry outside their caste. Are the laws confined to books only with no practical approach?? The lovers get turned into warriors fighting for the existence of their love in the family and the society. Is loving someone deeply such a big sin that it even amounts to ‘Honor Killings’. This story is not only of a girl but thousands of girls who have heard of their inner conscience, done a mistake of loving someone out of caste or out of religion. Either they have compromised with their life or have embraced death with open arms. Stories don’t end with it and everyday this beautiful feeling turns fierce with thousands of love birds who get lost in this ever ending sky. It really needs a change otherwise it’ll peter out either of the two: love or lovers.-RUTH DIYA CHATTOPADHYAY"

    "headline": "SURROGACY LAWS IN INDIAKnow Who are the New Judges of Supreme Court…DISCUSSION HOUR: DEMONETIZATIONEx-CJI’s nomination as a member of the Rajya Sabha by the President",
    "data": "In simple language surrogacy can be defined as – when a couple wants a baby and they are not able to conceive a baby due to medical issue then other women carries the artificial sperm of the father. Then that lady carries the child in her womb and then gives birth to the child to that couple. Then that woman is a biological mother of that child. The couple who are not able to conceive a baby and do not want to adopt a baby so they they go for the baby with the help of surrogacy. Surrogacy is when a lady other then the wife gives birth to a baby for a couple who want to have a child. There are two kinds of surrogacy –straight or traditional and host (or gestational surrogacy).Straight surrogacy is the simplest form of surrogacy .it is least expensive form of surrogacy and is also known as artificial insemination. In this form of surrogacy the surrogate uses the insemination kit to become pregnant using intended father’s semen. The baby who will be conceived will be by using the surrogate’s egg. Host is the type of surrogacy in which ivf is used, either with eggs of the intended mother or with the donor eggs. Then the surrogate does not use her own eggs and is genetically unrelated to the baby. This type of surrogacy is very expensive and is very complicated as compared to the straight (traditional) surrogacy. Host surrogacy always takes place in the fertility clinic. There are main three stages in host surrogacy i.e., egg donation, fertilisation, and transfer.Surrogacy is now a day’s very trendy in our bollywood. Celebrity who is single parent. For example –recently Karan johar has become a proud single parent of a set of twin i.e. A boy and a girl .the last Indian celebrity who went through surrogacy was tusshar kapoor , who also had son last year in June . There were many other celebrity who had their babies through surrogacy such as shah rukh khan and gauri khan, aamir khan and kiran rao khan, sohail khan and sachdeva khan, tusshar kapoor have all turned to surrogacy to expand their families .Surrogacy is an agreement between a surrogate mother and intended parents to carry a baby in her womb and to five births a child to another woman. The agreement which is made can be unasked volitional .it can also be paid or unpaid according to the people between whom the agreement is made .India has legalised all type of surrogacy since 2002 .India is also considered as the hub of surrogacy .India as an international surrogacy hub as the surrogacy contracts between the parties and assisted reproductive techniques clinics are the guiding force in India .international surrogacy law in India has come in India through the case bay manji yamada surrogacy case . As a result surrogacy business is well established in India .many doctors are earning a lot in surrogacy with the estimation of annual turnover of billion dollars .recently ,there was a surrogacy (regulation) bill 2016 , was popularised by health and family welfare in lok sabha and which adduce to ban commercial surrogacy in India which was legalised in 2003.The bill which is proposed in 2016 focuses mainly on the prevention of commercial surrogacy and also to get mileage of surrogate mothers and a child born through surrogacy. The bill focuses on the main points are as follows.– She also told that only the couple who are infertile and who are married for at least 5 years can only seek a surrogate and must also be a close relative.– According to sushma swaraj, close relative included a sister or sister in law or daughter in law. Single women would also not be allowed to become a surrogate mother. She also taunted to our bollywood celebrity such as Shah Rukh Khan, Karan johar etc. She told that it has become a culture among the celebrities for getting children through surrogacy.– There are many plans of the government to bring the bills that the government wants to bring that woman to act as a surrogate mother only once in her lifetime, that is in winter session of parliament. The law is also planning to fix the age limit of the male as well as the female i.e. Male between 26-55 years and female between 23-50 years.– There are many people who gave their views on their bill of 2016 , advocate anurag chawla of Delhi based surrogacy laws described the law as “too tough “, it will become very tough for those women who are trying to improve their financial condition through surrogacy or renting a womb. Commercial surrogacy is banned in many countries such as UK, Canada, and France it has detonated in India over the past 10 years with many couples, especially foreigners, flocking to the country, partly because its doctors and clinics bring the service at the relatively low cost.– The bill which is drafted makes it imperious for all the surrogacy clinics to register with the government. The clinics which will be registered will face jail term of 5 years and a fine of Rs. 10, 00,000.– They have full right to choose the surrogate mother whichever they want,– They also have the right to impose certain restrictions on that surrogate mother for the development of the child , – They also have the right to have the information about the surrogate mother and also meeting that lady at the time of surrogacy. – The couple also have the right to take the custody of the child within 72hrs. Of the birth.CONCLUSION- The bill i.e. the surrogacy (regulation) bill 2016 which is passed to establish the regulatory framework of good surrogacy practice in India. The bill also wants to impose restrictions on the foreign people who come here i.e. In India to give a birth to a child through surrogacy. So the main aim of the bill which is passed in 2016 is to ban commercial surrogacy. There are many advantages as well as the disadvantages of this bill. The main disadvantage is that there are many women whose financial condition will also get affected.Compiled by:SHIRALEE KINARIWALA B.A.LL.B INDORE INSTITUTE OF LAWEmbargo on commercial surrogacy – the bill which was passed also told that government has told Supreme Court to ban commercial surrogacy. The bill tells that in India Supreme Court has decided to block foreigners, people of Indian origin, homosexual and single parent from having children through surrogacy. Foreign minister sushma swaraj , also made an announcement at a press conference “we do not recognise live –in relationship and homosexual relationship ….this is against our ethos”Close relative – the bill mainly talks about the close relative of the couple to act as the surrogate mother. There are many couples whose close relative do not want to become the surrogate so it does not mean that they can’t have a baby. And if the close relative act as the surrogate then it is very obvious that both the surrogate mother and a child will also know about the fact of surrogacy. It may also cause many family problems in the later stage between the surrogate child and the surrogate mother.Restrictions for international surrogacy – procreative tourism are developed due to globalization and liberalisation. Procreative surrogacy is a process in which people go abroad for reproductive technology services and can also have a child with the process which they want. It is also less expensive, more efficient and wide range of services are also available , so these all region because of which procreative tourism is developed so the government is trying to restrict the international surrogacyWaiting period of 5 years – surrogacy was mainly opted by the couple when they are not able to conceive a child as they have tried many times so it is not necessary to wait for 5 years for availing the surrogacy service.Maternity relief – it is one of the issue on which the government should talk about. And this issue of maternity relief for intended couples as well as the surrogate mother has already been discussed in different high courts in India. But, the bill is silent about this issue.Designer baby – this is also one of the issue on which the Supreme Court should talk. This type of baby means that it is one of the criticism against the surrogacy is that surrogacy may also be used to produce children of desired sex and with desired characteristics i.e. It may also be used for the creation of designer baby. However the bill is silent on this issue also.Rights of the intended couples – there are certain rights which the intended couple have. They are as follows-"

    "data": "The Madras High Court Bench has refused to ban the sale of a book on history of the Mangalanathar Mangaleswari Temple at Uthirakosamangai in Ramanathapuram district in its judgement dated 2nd June 2017. The sale of the book outside the premises of the Temple was challenged on the ground that the author had not taken permission from Hindu Religious and Charitable Endowments Department to write the book. The author of the book Easan Easwari Pirantha Oor Thiru Uthirakosamangai Thiruthala Varalaru, P. Thangavelu filed a writ of mandamus earlier this year to forbear the police from preventing him and his representatives from selling his book outside the temple complex.

But the court held that while granting relief to the writ petitioner, the court only directed the respondent police and that too after recording their undertaking. Therefore, the temple could not have any grievance. However the court was entitled to work out their remedies in accordance with law, if aggrieved."

    "data": "As it is said that law should be dynamic and not static, in the same way the working of the courts and legal professionals should be dynamic and the same thing was seen during the past days when, In an unusual move, Rohini Civil Court in Delhi has noted that the blue double-tick sign of a WhatsApp message can serve as valid proof that a legal notice has been viewed by the recipients of the said message. Entangled in a family dispute, a man has served notice to his daughter-in-law, her parents and her friend on WhatsApp. And once he saw ‘blue double tick’ on the chat — indicating that his message had been read — the man took a colour printout of the screenshot, and submitted it to court as proof of the notice being served. Senior Civil Judge cum Rent Controller (North) Sidharth Mathur in Rohini Court recently accepted Whatsapp blue double-tick as receipt proof of notice on the Respondents. The case concerned an Appeal filed by a Model Town resident, seeking an injunction against his son and daughter-in-law, her parents and her friend from “trespassing into the suit property”. During the hearing, the Court had asked the Appellant to send a notice to all five Respondents, and had clarified that the notices can be served via Whatsapp, considering the urgency of the situation. Upon receiving the printouts, Senior Civil judge Sidharth Mathur stated that he had accepted it as proof that the five defendants were aware of the scheduled hearing. “I have gone through the record. The conveyance deed… of the suit property is in the name of the plaintiff, which makes him the exclusive owner… The defendants are restrained from trespassing into the suit property without due process of law till the next date of hearing. Though defendants number one to four have been served via WhatsApp, but still I deem it appropriate that they be served once again. Accordingly, issue fresh summons to defendants number one to four on filing PF/RC returnable for 24.05.2017,” the court order said. The Delhi High Court had recently joined ranks several Courts around the country that are experimenting with the usage of technology in judicial proceedings. In a first, the Court had ordered service of summons on one of the defendants through Whatsapp, text message and email. Last month, the High Court of Bombay had also served summons via Whatsapp, after one of the defendants in a copyright infringement case was being particularly evasive. The case concerned allegations of copyright infringement case were being particularly evasive. The case concerned allegations of copyright infringement against Producers of the Kannada movie ‘Pushpaka Vimana’ that was released earlier this year. And through this way the court paved new and easy way to carry out legal formalities in the Indian Legal System and not only tried to reform the system but also tried to ease the system from various complex procedures and this step can be seen as a step to build a new and easy procedure that will benefit the society and as a result will lead to the upgradation of the country."

Here are a 5 important facts that India informed the top UN court about. May 18, 2017 13:40 (IST) India has not approached the international court on any case related to Pakistan since 1971, but the government has said it had no choice as the life of an Indian citizen is at stake. India has appealed to the International Court of Justice to annul Mr Jadhav’s death sentence and ensure that Pakistan does not act against the rights of India or of Mr Jadhav. May 18, 2017 13:37 (IST) Last week, after India challenged the death sentence given to Kulbhushan Jadhav, Pakistan was asked by the International Court to put it on hold. Pakistan on Monday alleged that calling it a “stay order” was India’s “manoeuvre”. Pakistan also said that Mr Jadhav’s passport bears a Muslim name. They further claimed that India had been unable to explain it. May 18, 2017 13:33 (IST) Describing Kulbhushan Jadhav’s trial by a Pakistani military court as “farcical” and without a shred of evidence, Mr Salve said he was not given a lawyer until the trial was nearly over. “The basic rights of Kulbhushan Jadhav were thrown to the winds,” he said. India further informed the top UN court that Pakistan had violated the Vienna Convention by denying India consular access to Mr Jadhav 16 times and denying him the right to defend himself. May 18, 2017 13:24 (IST) Representing India at the ICJ, senior lawyer Harish Salve told the top UN court that, “The situation is grave, it is urgent, and hence we approached this court at such short notice.” He urged the court to suspend Mr Jadhav’s death sentence immediately. Mr Salve brought to the court’s notice that Pakistan had repeatedly denied consular access to India and no document of Kulbhushan Jadhav’s trial process was given by Islamabad. This, he said, was in violation of the Vienna Convention on Consular Access. May 18, 2017 13:19 (IST) On Monday, India informed the ICJ that there was an “immediate threat” that Indian national Kulbhushan Jadhav may be executed by Pakistan even before a decision of the top UN court. Pakistan then assured that there would be no immediate execution, saying that it won’t happen at least for the next six months.May 18, 2017 13:14 (IST)On May 8, India moved the ICJ (International Court of Justice) against the death penalty handed down to Kulbhushan Jadhav by a Pakistan military court, slamming Pakistan for violating the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations. On May 9, the highest court in the United Nations gave Mr Jadhav a lease of life. India, in its appeal to the ICJ asserted that Mr Jadhav was kidnapped from Iran where he was involved in business activities after taking early retirement from the Indian Navy.

    "headline": "Justice Karnan Issue: Former HC Judge CS Karnan get arrested in CoimbatoreCENTRE ISSUES GUIDELINES FOR DELIVERY OF ESSENTIAL GOODS THROUGH E-COMMERCEAbduction: Breach of FreedomLIABILITY ON ELECTION COMMISSION FOR ITS FAILURE TO STOP THE ABUSE OF COVID PROTOCOL",
    "data": "INTRODUCTION:-Former Calcutta High Court Judge CS Karnan was on Tuesday arrested from Tamil Nadu’s Coimbatore and was taken to Chennai. “Karnan had been found staying in an apartment at Madukarai, near Coimbatore. We provided technical assistance to the West Bengal police, and they arrested him from the apartment,” A Amalraj, City Comissioner of Police (Coimbatore), told TOI. Sixty-two-year-old Justice Karnan had been evading arrest since May 9 after being sentenced to six months imprisonment for contempt of court by the Supreme Court. He won the dubious distinction of being the first sitting high court judge to be awarded a jail term by the apex court. Karnan is facing six months imprisonment for contempt of the Supreme Court, retired on June 12, probably escaping the odium of a sitting judge being arrested while in office.There are series of events which raises questions and one of them is a very important one i.e. is there any law to discipline judges. The judiciary is one of the important mechanism of our society whose job is to give correct interpretation of laws and to fill the vacuum between the society and the law. But what happens when the judiciary instead of filling the vacuum starts taking advantage of this vacuum. The Judges (inquiry) Act, 1968 has time and again failed to discipline judges. The said Act talks about impeachment of judges but does not address infractions that are not serious enough for impeachment.MAIN ISSUE:-Justice C.S Karnan of the Calcutta High Court has been on headlines lately because of his indecisive behaviour. But this is not the first time that the honourable Judge is in trouble. His behaviour with fellow judges in Madras High Court was found to be so offensive that 21 of them signed a complaint against him[1]. On 23rd January Justice Karnan wrote a letter to the Prime Minister[2]. He urged Prime Minister Modi to go through the initial list of corrupt Judges of Madras High Court and also requested the Prime Minister that these officials shall be interrogated by the officers of central agencies[3].On 8th February, 2017 the Supreme Court took judicial note of several letters with serious allegations of corruption and bias against members of the judiciary over the last three years [4].As Karnan failed to appear, the apex court on 10 March, in another unprecedented move, issued a bailable warrant against him[5]. The Court issued contempt notice against Justice Karnan for alleged judicial indiscipline[6]. In response to this the honourable Justice accused them of harbouring a caste bias against him[7]. He accused the CJI J S Khehar led seven judge bench of upper caste bias in initiating the proceedings as he belonged to the dalit community[8]. The judge challenged the order as being an offence under the law to punish atrocities against Dalits and tribalsand challenged the court to refer his case to parliament[9]. He also asked the CJI and six judges of the Supreme Court to appear before him at his “residential court” on April 28[10]. Later in an order, Karnan directed the Air Control Authority in New Delhi not to allow the CJI and other six judges to travel abroad[11].Currently the Supreme Court ordered medical examination of Justice CS Karnan[12]. To which the Judge replied by passing an order for psychiatric examination of the seven judges of the apex Court who heard case against him[13]. The Supreme Court directed the Kolkata government hospital to carry out the medical examination of the judge[14].Justice Karnan had on 4 May declined to undergo a mental health checkup as ordered by the supreme court, telling a team of doctors he is “absolutely normal” and has a “stable mind”.Justice Karnan also added another supreme court judge Justice R Banumathi in the list against whom the order was passed for having restrained his judicial and administrative work along with CJI Khehar.The bench had initiated suo motu(on its own) contempt proceedings against Justice Karnan and restrained him from performing judicial and administrative work.He named members of the apex court’s seven-judge bench, comprising the Chief Justice of India, Justices Dipak Misra, J Chelameswar, Ranjan Gogoi, Madan B Lokur, Pinaki Chandra Ghose and Kurian Joseph.On Monday, in an escalation of his confrontation with the Supreme Court, Justice Karnan while awarding the ‘sentence’ said the eight judges have “jointly committed the offences punishable under the SC/ST Atrocities Act of 1989 and amended Act of 2015.On Tuesday, Supreme Court created two firsts in judicial history- it jailed sitting high court judge C S Karnan for six months, convicting him for contempt of court, and it gagged the media from reporting his reaction or his future statements.CONCLUSION:-This kind of behaviour coming from a judge is a wake up call for the whole nation. It also emphasises on the importance of having strict regulatory behaviour for the judges. A judge who has several times tried to malign people from his fraternity is not only a threat to his fraternity. It is also the responsibility of the state to stop being a silent spectator and take strict actions against this kind of behaviour.The lesson here is that while the collegium system had been unable to stop someone of his nature entering judicial office, maintaining internal discipline in the judiciary is an equally vexing issue.

    "data": "THREE JUDGES BENCH DELIVERED THE JUDGEMENTDELHI HIGH COURT HAVE UPHELD DEATH SENTENCE FOR THE CONVICTS BY TRIAL COURTREVIEW PETITION, PRESIDENTIAL PARDON- LAST OPTION AVAILABLE A bench comprising Justices Diapk Misra, R Banumathi and Ashok Bhushan delivered the judgement Today in the case that had shaken the entire nation’s conscience.Nearly five years after a 23-year-old medical student on her way home from a movie was fatally gang-raped and tortured on a moving bus in Delhi, the Supreme Court decided that four convicts should be sentenced to death and they don’t deserve mercy. A trial court had ruled in 2013 that they should be hanged and the High Court confirmed the sentence. But the four – Akshay Thakur, Vinay Sharma, Pawan Gupta and Mukesh – challenged it in the Supreme Court. The Delhi gang-rape case convicts had appealed before the Supreme Court against their death sentence. On December 16 2012, the young woman and her friend boarded a bus in south Delhi, assured by the driver that they would be dropped off at their destination. The two were then attacked and the woman was gang-raped by six men, brutalized with an iron rod and her intestines were pulled out. She died in a Singapore hospital 13 days later. “These men should be hanged. There is no crime more barbaric than this….I’m certain about that,” said the father of the woman, who came to be known as “Nirbhaya”. Ram Singh, the bus driver, was found hanging in his cell in Tihar jail in March 2013, months before they were convicted. Last August, Vinay Sharma had also allegedly tried to commit suicide. The sixth convict was just months short of 18 when he participated in the horrific crime.He walked out of a correction home in December 2015 after spending three years – the maximum punishment for minors – sparking public outrage and an overhaul of the juvenile law. Now, a juvenile between 16 and 18 years can be treated as an adult if they commit a heinous crime.The apex court had, on March 27, reserved its verdict on the appeal of four convicts — Mukesh, Pawan, Vinay Sharma and Akshay Kumar Singh — against the conviction and death penalty awarded to them by the high court on March 13, 2014. The 23-year-old paramedic was brutally assaulted and raped by six persons in a moving bus in south Delhi and thrown out of the vehicle with her male friend on the night of December 16, 2012. She had died in a Singapore hospital on December 29 the same year.Besides dealing with the conviction, the apex court was also deliberating on the issue of quantum of sentence to the convicts as it has been alleged that the trial court did not separately consider “mitigating” circumstances of each convict while sending them to the gallows. While the Delhi Police had sought capital punishment for the convicts, the defence counsel had said they deserved leniency considering their poor family background and young age. The police had told the bench that the horrific crime committed by these men warranted death penalty and the test of being a “rarest of rare” case was satisfied in this matter and the court should also consider the effect of crime committed by them on the victim and the society at large.Senior advocate Sanjay Hegde, who has assisted the court as an amicus curiae, had told the bench that there was no doubt that the crime committed was of “immense proportion” but as the evidence was not concrete, it does not warrant death penalty.Senior counsel Raju Ramachandran, also an amicus curiae, had said that option of awarding jail term for the whole life to these convicts may also be considered. The convicts have approached the Supreme Court against the high court’s order which had confirmed the death penalty awarded to them by the trial court. During the hearing, advocates A P Singh and M L Sharma, representing the four convicts, had said they should be given a chance to reform and considering the mitigating factors, the court should not award them death penalty. They also raised questions about the evidence collected by the police in the matter.On February 3, the apex court bench had prima facie agreed with the contention of Ramachandran that the provision of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), relating to sentencing of convicts, has not been followed in letter and spirit by the trial court. It was submitted that section 235 of the CrPC provides that an accused, in the event of conviction, would be heard on the question of sentencing individually, before the trial judge passes the order awarding punishment. The bench had then mulled ways to rectify the apparent error and said there are two modes — either the case be remanded back to the trial court to pass a fresh order on the sentence or the apex court itself hears this aspect of the matter afresh. The trial court had awarded death penalty to the four convicts. Prime accused Ram Singh had allegedly committed suicide in his cell in Tihar jail in March 2013 and proceedings against him were abated. The high court, in its verdict, had observed that their offence fell in the rarest of the rare category and had upheld the death sentence awarded to them by the trial court.

The verdict will be delivered today at 2pm as per the cause list. The fate of the four accused who shook the nation’s conscience will be decided today. However, in the same matter Justice Dipak Mishra and Justice R Banumathi will deliver separate judgements.It was on December 16th 2012, when a 23 year old girl, physiotherapy intern was gang raped and brutally assaulted on her private part in a moving bus. Her friend was beaten black and blue with an iron rod. After the horrible act they threw both them out of the bus. They lay bleeding on the roads for the next 40 minutes before police arrived, the information was received by them through a passerby. The bus was cleaned after the incidence to destroy the evidence. The police discovered the iron rod using which she was assaulted. Due to extremely critical condition she was shifted to Singapore for better treatment. She struggled for her life and died. On December 19th, 2012 her friend testified in the Court. His statement was recorded by the sub-divisional magistrate in presence of Deputy Commissioner of Police.On 11th March one of the accused Ram Singh was found hanging from the ventilator shaft. On August 31st, 2013 one of the accused was a juvenile who was tried by the Juvenile Justice Board, where he was awarded 3 years imprisonment to special home. Rest of them were charged with rape, murder, destroying evidence, kidnapping and attempt of murder. They were tried in a fast track court which sentenced them to death.On March 13th, 2014 the Delhi High Court confirmed the death sentence. On March 1st, 2014 Supreme Court stayed the execution of two of the four convicts on their allegation that a fair trial was not observed. On April 3rd, 2016 Supreme Court hears the case followed by the appointment of Senior Advocate Raju Ramachandran and Sanjay Hegde Amicus Curae. There were allegation that the evidence was tapered. Senior Advocate Raju Ramachandran and Amicus Curae requests to set aside the order because the provisions of the Cr.P.C was not followed as well as the tests prescribed the Supreme Court while awarding death sentence which was not considered by the Trial Court and the Delhi High Court. Senior Advocate Sanjay Hedge and Amicus Curae argues against reliability of evidence in the case. He argued that there is no evidence to prove conspiracy. It was submitted to the Court, “In the present case, insofar as the lack of planning or premeditation regarding the crime is concerned, it can be said that the accused did not plan the offence in detail or carry out the plan in a calculated manner which signifies the absence of social predisposition or hardened criminality. While there is no doubt that the manner of the commission of the crime was brutal, it is premeditation and planning which determines the disposition of the accused, and the lack of pre-mediation or reflection on the actions of the accused should be considered in determining the possibility of reform of the accused.” On February 3rd, 2017 Supreme Court decides to rehear the case on sentencing aspect due to contention by the petitioners that there has been violations in the procedure. The Supreme Court reserved the verdict on March 27th, 2017.Compiled by – Snigdha Panigrahi"

    "data": " T P Senkumar filed a contempt plea against Chief Secretary, Nalini Netto on account of delay for reinstatement of Senkumar as the State DGP. In his petition he has alleged that Nalini Netto was the one who attempted to remove him from post and can do anything to ensure he is not reinstated back in his post. The petition stated “The intention of the Respondent Contemnor, who is the authority to issue orders of reinstatement, seems to delay the implementation willfully so that the Petitioner will not get the fruits of the decree which he has got. The Contemnor is also conscious of the fact that once this Hon’ble Court closes for summer recess on 9th may 2017, it reopens only on 3rd July, 2017 which will make the Petitioner remediless and thus frustrate the judgment of this Hon’ble Court”. He marked out an instance where Nalini Netto was awarded imprisonment for one month on failure to comply with the order of Supreme Court. He also requested the Court to take action against Nalini Netto for willful disobedience in carrying out Supreme Court’s order. He pleaded for extension of his term which was taken away illegally from him. The Karnataka government which was a party to this case sought for the advice of Advocate Harish Salve who advised to implement the order of Apex Court instead of filing a review petition.The new government after coming into power removed Senkumar citing reasons as ineffective performance of Senkumar accusing of investigation and mishandling of Jisha case and that he had protected “erring” police officials in the Puttingal temple fire tragedy in which 100 people died and 300 people injured. .” He was transferred and did not take the charge but challenged the decision in the Court after being transferred as head of the Police Housing Construction Corporation. Loknath Behra replaced him in the position. Advocate Haris Beeran appearing for Senkumar argued that the removal of Senkumar by the CM was due to Senkumar’s independent and thorough investigation into the political violence in the state in which several CPI(M) leaders had come under the probe” and had “nothing to do with his handling of Jisha murder case or Puttingal fire tragedy” as alleged by the state government. Senkumar said he was punished for carrying out an impartial probe into the 2012 murder of Marixist renegade TP Chandrasekharan in which police booked many CPI (M) leaders. Several CPI (M) leaders are in jail in the case.The Supreme Court ruled, “On an overall consideration of the material on record and considering the case in its proper perspective, that is the events post the Puttingal Temple tragedy and the Jisha murder and not the two tragedies themselves, we have no hesitation in concluding that the appellant has been unfairly and arbitrarily dealt with. Under the circumstances, we are compelled to set aside the judgment and order of the Central Administrative Tribunal, the impugned judgment and order of the High Court as well as the order dated 1 st June, 2016 and direct the State of Kerala to reinstate the appellant Dr. T.P. Senkumar as the State Police Chief.” BySnigdha"

    "data": "The judgment in Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala,, was crucial in upholding the supremacy of the Constitution and preventing authoritarian rule by a single partyForty Four years ago, on April 24, 1973, Chief Justice Sikri and 12 judges of the Supreme Court assembled to deliver the most important judgment in its history. The case of Kesavananda Bharati v State of Kerala had been heard for 68 days, the arguments commencing on October 31, 1972, and ending on March 23, 1973. The hard work and scholarship that had gone into the preparation of this case was breathtaking. Literally hundreds of cases had been cited and the then Attorney-General had made a comparative chart analysing the provisions of the Constitutions of 71 different countries! CORE QUESTION All this effort was to answer just one main question: was the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution unlimited? In other words, could Parliament alter, amend, abrogate any part of the Constitution even to the extent of taking away all fundamental rights?Article 368, on a plain reading, did not contain any limitation on the power of Parliament to amend any part of the Constitution. There was nothing that prevented Parliament from taking away a citizen’s right to freedom of speech or his religious freedom. But the repeated amendments made to the Constitution raised a doubt: was there any inherent or implied limitation on the amending power of Parliament?The 703-page judgment revealed a sharply divided court and, by a wafer-thin majority of 7:6, it was held that Parliament could amend any part of the Constitution so long as it did not alter or amend “the basic structure or essential features of the Constitution.” This was the inherent and implied limitation on the amending power of Parliament. This basic structure doctrine, as future events showed, saved Indian democracy and Kesavananda Bharati will always occupy a hallowed place in our constitutional history.SUPREME COURT V INDIRA GANDHI It is supremely ironical that the basic structure theory was first introduced by Justice Mudholkar eight years earlier by referring to a 1963 decision of the Supreme Court of Pakistan. Chief Justice Cornelius — yes, Pakistan had a Christian Chief Justice and, later, a Hindu justice as well — had held that the President of Pakistan could not alter the “fundamental features” of their Constitution.The Kesavananda Bharati case was the culmination of a serious conflict between the judiciary and the government then headed by Mrs Indira Gandhi. In 1967, the Supreme Court took an extreme view, in the Golak Nath case, that Parliament could not amend or alter any fundamental right. Two years later, Indira Gandhi nationalised 14 major banks and the paltry compensation was made payable in bonds that matured after 10 years! This was struck down by the Supreme Court, although it upheld the right of Parliament to nationalise banks and other industries. A year later, in 1970, Mrs Gandhi abolished the Privy Purses. This was a constitutional betrayal of the solemn assurance given by Sardar Patel to all the erstwhile rulers. This was also struck down by the Supreme Court. Ironically, the abolition of the Privy Purses was challenged by the late Madhavrao Scindia, who later joined the Congress Party.Smarting under three successive adverse rulings, which had all been argued by N.A. Palkhivala, Indira Gandhi was determined to cut the Supreme Court and the High Courts to size and she introduced a series of constitutional amendments that nullified the Golak Nath, Bank Nationalisation and Privy Purses judgments. In a nutshell, these amendments gave Parliament uncontrolled power to alter or even abolishes any fundamental right.These drastic amendments were challenged by Kesavananda Bharati, the head of a math in Kerala, and several coal, sugar and running companies. On the other side, was not only the Union of India but almost all the States which had also intervened? This case had serious political overtones with several heated exchanges between N.A. Palkhivala for the petitioners and H.M. Seervai and Niren De, who appeared for the State of Kerala and the Union of India respectively.The infamous Emergency was declared in 1975 and, by then, eight new judges had been appointed to the Supreme Court. A shocking attempt was made by Chief Justice Ray to review the Kesavananda Bharati decision by constituting another Bench of 13 judges. In what is regarded as the finest advocacy that was heard in the Supreme Court, Palkhivala made an impassioned plea for not disturbing the earlier view. In a major embarrassment to Ray, it was revealed that no one had filed a review petition. How this Bench was then constituted? The other judges strongly opposed this impropriety and the 13-judge Bench was dissolved after two days of arguments. The tragic review was over but it did irreversible damage to the reputation of Chief Justice A.N. Ray. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS SAVED If the majority of the Supreme Court had held (as six judges indeed did) that Parliament could alter any part of the Constitution, India would most certainly have degenerated into a totalitarian State or had one-party rule. At any rate, the Constitution would have lost its supremacy. Even Seervai later admitted that the basic structure theory preserved Indian democracy. One has to only examine the amendments that were made during the Emergency. The 39th Amendment prohibited any challenge to the election of the President, Vice-President, Speaker and Prime Minister, irrespective of the electoral malpractice. This was a clear attempt to nullify the adverse Allahabad High Court ruling against Indira Gandhi. The 41st Amendment prohibited any case, civil or criminal, being filed against the President, Vice-President, Prime Minister or the Governors, not only during their term of office but forever. Thus, if a person was a governor for just one day, he acquired immunity from any legal proceedings for life. If Parliament were indeed supreme, these shocking amendments would have become part of the Constitution.Thanks to Kesavananda Bharati, Palkhivala and the seven judges who were in the majority, India continues to be the world’s largest democracy. The souls of Nehru, Patel, Ambedkar and all the founding fathers of our Constitution can really rest in peace"

    "data": "Megha KumariIndore Institute of LawThere is no justification to keep the enforcement of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act under suspension till certain amendments are carried out, SC tells government. In a major verdict, the Supreme Court on 27th April, 2017 held that there is no explanation in delaying the appointments of Lokpals and Lokayuktas. The SC held that the Lokpal Act is a workable piece of legislation and there is no justification in putting its enforcement on hold.A bench comprising justices Ranjan Gogoi and Navin Sinha rejected the government’s contention that a Lokpal cannot be appointed because certain amendments to the law are pending before Parliament. “There is no justification to keep the enforcement of the Act under suspension till the proposed amendments are carried out,” the court said. The apex court said the Act was an eminently workable piece of legislation and it “does not create any bar to the enforcement of the provisions”. The bench quoted provisions of the legislation to hold that the appointment of chairperson or member of the Lokpal will not become invalid “merely because of the reason of any vacancy in the selection committee”.The court opined that if the leader of the opposition is not available at present, the chairperson and the other two members of the selection committee — the Lok Sabha Speaker and the Chief Justice of India (CJI) or his nominee — may proceed to appoint an eminent jurist as a panel member to make recommendations to the President. The court’s order came in response to a public interest litigation (PIL) filed in 2014 by advocate Prashant Bhushan-led Common Cause, which challenged the constitutionality of the search committee rules for appointment of Lokpal.The bench also dismissed a petition by NGO Just Society to declare as ultra vires some of the provisions of the Lokpal Act, saying there was no merit in it. Dismissing the challenge against constitutionality of certain provisions of the Lokpal and Lokayuktas Act, the Supreme Court has held that the Constitution does not mandate that in all matters concerning the appointment to various offices in different bodies, primacy must be accorded to the opinion of the Chief Justice or his nominee. The petition challenged the provisions on the ground that the Chief Justice of India or his nominee Judge of the Supreme Court, under Section 4(1)(d) of the Act, is a mere member of the selection committee and the opinion rendered by either of them has no primacy in the matter of selection of Chairperson and members of the Lokpal. The court said if the legislature in its wisdom had thought it proper not to accord primacy to the opinion of the Chief Justice or his nominee and accord equal status to the opinion rendered by the Chief Justice or his nominee and treat such opinion at par with the opinion rendered by other members of the selection committee, “we do not see how such legislative wisdom can be questioned on the ground of constitutional infirmity”.The court also rejected the contention that that there are no norms laid down for appointment of an ’eminent jurist’ under Section 4(1) (e) of the Act, thereby, rendering the aforesaid provision of the Act legally and constitutionally fragile. “As a policy of zero tolerance against corruption, the bill seeks to establish in the country, a more effective mechanism to receive complaints relating to allegations of corruption against public servants,” the court said, underlining the necessity to have the watchdog.

    "data": "The article talks about the reasons why representation of women in the legal profession was not huge and the present status of Supreme Court judges.The legal profession in India is of high importance. Previously there were very few women opting for this profession but now there seems to be a change.Cornelia Sorabji was the first female advocate of Allahabad in 1921.The legal profession had thrown open its doors to the female population of India. Formally, after the passing of the Legal Practitioners’ (Women) Act, XXIII of 1923 abolishing the bar on women from practising Law, Indian women were granted the right to take up the legal profession and practice as Advocates in the Courts of Law. Cornelia Sorabji had pioneered the fight for justice for the ‘’pardanashin’’ women of her times, who on account of their ignorance and lack of formal education could be easily deceived by the legal men or their touts. They could not seek assistance from male Advocates in the event of disputes simply because they were men .Initially only a few women joined the profession as Advocates. This reformative measure ignited the spirit of pleading for the cause of another before the Courts. Perhaps the realisation had set in; in the pre-independent era that freedom from “slavery” if it was possible could be obtained through educating women The British rule had established schools, colleges and Universities for women by the 1860s in India, but they did not have access of it until the 1920s and hence it stopped them from possessing such skills which would make them decision makers in society.[1]The Constitution of India has given all its citizens the right to equality and the right against discrimination on the basis of their gender from acquiring any education or practising any profession of their choice. In spite of this right, the Legal profession did not become a popular choice for women, simply because they weren’t given education. Education wasn’t received by them due to many reasons such as poverty, stringent caste restrictions, restrictive social customs, and cultural practices condemning the working of women outside their homes.the Indian Judiciary was active in its encouragement of women who took up the legal profession and went on to appoint the first woman Judge Hon’ble Justice Anna Chandy to Kerala High Court. Justice Anna Chandy had started her career as an Advocate in 1929 and had been appointed a Munsiff in 1937 thus becoming the first Woman Judge in pre-independent India. These two decades also saw the entry into the legal profession of two eminent lawyers who went on to become Hon’ble Justice Leila Seth and Hon’ble Justice Fathima Beevi Chief Justices of Himachal Pradesh and Kerala High Courts respectively. The former had been an actively practising advocate in the Delhi, Kolkata and Patna High Courts for more than 15 years and the latter had risen from the position of a Munsiff and had retired as a Supreme Court Judge eventually. Curiously, over the years the representation of women has not increased in the Judiciary corresponding to the initial number of women Judges. The situation is such that there has been a demand of 33% reservation for women in the Judiciary to bring about parity between the numbers of male and female judges. [2]Since 1970s women have chosen legal profession and have become successful Advocates, Academicians, legal aid workers or volunteers and draftsperson, judiciary etc , and from the past 10 years, a phenomenal growth , in number of women joining law and legal practice can be seen. They have become a part of the legal profession whether it is advocacy or judiciary or draftsperson or etc. Meera Sahib Fatima Bibi inspired thousands of life by being the first woman judge in Supreme Court in India.The Growth of women in the legal profession can be seen from the under mentioned table From the above table, it can easily be propounded that the % of women from 3.12 has increased to 5.08 in 40 years which does not denote very good growth but it implies a increasing growth.[3]The profession of law has been a male dominated field since 19th century in India. Women were denied the right to practice law until High Court of Allahabad took lead and allowed Miss Cornelia Sorabji in 1921 to practice law. Since then, though the number has increased yet, not many women joined the bandwagon. It was only after 1970s that number of female legal practioners increased. The profession in recent times has attracted a large number of women in India to study law. The number of female legal practioners is less. Further, women faced a lot of problems in practicing in court and thus, the profession itself drives less number of women. There does not seem to be gender discrimination as both female and male candidates are given equal opportunity to appear in competitive examination. As far as higher judiciary is concerned, there has been sort of discrimination because collegiums have recommended only few female names. There are a few safeguards that can be adopted by the females of our society. Article 14 and Article 15(3) of the Indian Constitution empowers the State to make special provisions for women and children. India is a signatory to Conventions on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), 1979, which envisaged removal of obstacles of women’s public participation in all spheres of public and private lives.” [4]Since independence, only 6 women judges have been elevated to Supreme Court out of total 229 judges. Out of 29 Supreme Court judges, only one judgment has been given by a female judge –justice R Banumathi. There are only 63 woman judges whereas 611 male judges. When the Supreme Court Women Lawyers Association brought these facts to the attention of the constitution bench it initiated the process of improving the collegiums alleging a gender bias and discrimination against women in appointment. The issue also figured in the suggestions given to the court by legal luminaries and was compiled by senior counsel Arvind Datar and ASG Pinky Anand. “There is an urgent need to increase the number of women judges. The percentage is very low in most High Courts”, it said.

The producers are facing a copyright infringement case. In this case, the plaintiff’s have tried to serve the summon on defendants address by courier and hand delivery havingobtained their addresses from the secretariat of Central Board of Film Certification. The first defendant i.e. AK Vikhyat changed his address in order to evade service. On contacting him over his mobile phone the true caller app displayed his contact and the Whatsapp status revealed his status as Pushpaka Vimana. Vikhayat and Deepak Krishna received the copies of plaint, notice of motion and order of 17th March, 2017. This was acknowledged by Vikhyat’s reply, “‘I dint understand anything. Will check with my legal team and I’ll text you back. I am out of station.” the email and that the matter will be heard in court was delivered to the defendants.Justice Gautam Patel noted in his order-“I do not see what more can be done for the purposes of this Motion. It cannot be that our rules and procedure are either so ancient or so rigid (or both) that without some antiquated formal service mode through a bailiff or even by beat of drum or pattaki, a party cannot be said to have been ‘properly’ served.The purpose of service is put the other party to notice and to give him a copy of the papers. The mode is surely irrelevant. We have not formally approved of email and other modes as acceptable simply because there are inherent limitations to proving service. Where an alternative mode is used, however, and service is shown to be effected, and is acknowledged, then surely it cannot be suggested that the Defendants had ‘no notice’……Defendants who avoid and evade service by regular modes cannot be permitted to take advantage of that evasion.”Despite several attempts on the part of the plaintiff, the defendants neither replied to the notice of motion nor appeared before the Court. Vikhyat and Krishna were only trying to evade the service. The purpose of service notice to the defendants was to make them aware, which was fulfilled by exchange of emails and messages. Dr. Saraf appearing for the plaintiff prayer for prevention of distribution or exhibition of the movie in any form and pass an ad-interim order. Justice Patel prima facie agreed with the argument made by the petitioners that the Pushpaka Vimana was a “colourable imitation of the Korean movie. Consequently, the ordered to grant temporary injunction restraining from showing, exhibiting,communicating or making it available for the public and also restrained from entering into any agreement with the third parties for grant of satellite rights. An injunction order was passes against the defendants refraining any person to create any rights in the Kannada film. "

    "data": "Highlights:SC sets Alimony BenchmarkEx- Hubby to pay 20000 every monthOver rules Calcutta HC to pay 23000 pm The Supreme Court has set a benchmark for alimony to be paid by a husband to his separated wife, stating that 25 per cent of his net salary might constitute a “just and proper” amount of alimony, says a Times of India report.The apex court’s order came on the man’s plea challenging a Calcutta High Court order directing him to pay his estranged wife Rs 23,000 per month.Though the Supreme Court said that there was nothing wrong with the high court order, it reduced the alimony amount by Rs 3,000 on the ground that the man had remarried and hence needed to provide for his new family.The observation, made by a bench of Justices R Banumathi and MM Santanagoudar, came while directing a West Bengal man, with a salary of Rs 95,527, to set aside Rs 20,000 as maintenance for his estranged wife and their son.The couple has been fighting a legal battle over maintenance since 2003 when the district judge fixed the amount at Rs 4,500. The high court, however, awarded Rs 16,000 per month in 2015 and increased it to Rs 23,000 in 2016 as the husband’s salary went up from Rs 63,842 to Rs 95,527. The bench said:“Twenty-five per cent of the husband’s net salary would be just and proper to be awarded as maintenance to the (former) wife. The amount of permanent alimony awarded to her must be befitting the status of the parties and the capacity of the spouse to pay maintenance, which is always dependant on the factual situation of the case… and the court would be justified in moulding the claim for maintenance passed on various factors,” The apex court’s ruling follows its inclination to protect claims of women in matrimonial disputes affecting their financial status.The apex court had said in a judgment it had delivered in 2016:“A Hindu woman’s right to maintenance is a personal obligation so far as the husband is concerned, and it is his duty to maintain her even if he has no property… . It is well settled that under the Hindu Law, the husband has got a personal obligation to maintain his wife and if he is possessed of properties then his wife is entitled to a right to be maintained out of such properties,” Sources:http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/supreme-court-sets-alimony-benchmark-25-of-ex-husbands-net-salary/articleshow/58288399.cmshttp://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-sc-sets-25-per-cent-of-husband-s-salary-as-benchmark-for-alimony-to-ex-wife-378008 "

It imposes a duty on every citizen ‘to protect and improve the natural environment including forests, lakes, rivers, and wildlife’.

The Department of Environment was established in India in 1980 to ensure a healthy environment for the country. This later became the Ministry of Environment and Forests in 1985.The constitutional provisions are backed by a number of laws – acts, rules, and notifications. The EPA (Environment Protection Act), 1986 came into force soon after the Bhopal Gas Tragedy and is considered an umbrella legislation as it fills many gaps in the existing laws. Thereafter a large number of laws came into existence as the problems began arising, for example, Handling and Management of Hazardous Waste Rules in 1989. "

    "data": "Kulbhusan Jadhav was arrested in Chaman area of Balochistan, while coming from Iran on March 3, 2016. On April 10th, he was sentenced to death on grounds of indulgence in subversive activities, espionage and working for India’s RAW against Pakistan. He was tried by the Pakistan Military Court under Pakistan Army Act. His sentence was confirmed by the army Chief Gen. Qamar Javed Bajwa after the Field General Court Martial found him to be guilty.His confession was released at Press Information Department, whereby confessing that he ws serving the Indian Navy under the cover name of Hussein Mubarik Patel. He joined National Defense Academy in 1987 and the Indian Navy in 1991. He served the Indian Navy till 2001 and now continues until his retirement due for 2022. He even confessed that he was picked for RAW in 2013 to degenerate the law and order situation in Karachi and Balochistan. His activities were criminal in nature, leading to killing and maiming of Pakistani citizens.Pakistan produced a passport which displayed the name as “Hussein Mubarik Patel” born in Sangli, Maharashtra along with a valid Iranian visa. India accepted that he was Navy officer but denied the allegation of having any links with the Government. The intelligence sources pointed out as to why in Jadhav’s case normal procedure of being tried by any Court in Pakistan was not followed instead he was tried by the Martial Court where he was sentenced under controversial amendments of the Army Act. On April 11, Pakistan’s Defense Minister Khwaja Asif said Jadhav can appeal to Army Chief and within 60 days to President. He case taking a turn, linked the missing of a Pakistan Army Officer named Lt. Col. (Retd.) Muhammad Habib Zahir from Nepal and sentencing of Jadhav. Habib’s family members allege that he has been kidnapped by Indian agencies. It is considered to be a move to know whether he is in the custody of India or not. Pakistan continues to refuse consular access to Jadhav, earlier rejecting 13 consular access requests from India. Pakistan has prepared a new dossier to share with UN and other foreign envoy. This issue has severely strained the India-Pakistan ties. After warning Pakistan that refusal to consular access is in contravention of International Law, External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj warned in Parliament, “Under these circumstances, we have no choice but to regard the sentence, if carried out, as an act of pre-meditated murder,”On April 19th, a PIL was dismissed by the Delhi High Court seeking direction to the Government for approaching the International Court of Justice for release of Jadhav. It contended that denial to consular access was in contravention of the Vienna Convention on Consular Relations, 1963, which renders state parties entitled to invoke the jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice under Optional Protocol to which both India and Pakistan acceded. Mr. Sanjay Jain, Additional Solicitor General of India, submitted that India has reacted with promptitude at the highest level. The bench said, “We have no doubt at all that the respondents are best placed to take the decisions as also all appropriate steps to safeguard the life and liberty of the citizens of this country. As informed by Mr. Jain, ld. ASG, all steps are being taken in the present case and with urgency”.BySnigdha Panigrahi"

    "data": "The Supreme Court restored criminal conspiracy charges against senior BJP leaders, including L K Advani, M M Joshi and Uma Bharti in the Babri Masjid demolition case today.A bench comprising Justices P C Ghose and R F Nariman pronounced the judgement, ordering the separate trials being conducted in trial courts at Rae Bareli and Lucknow to be clubbed and conducted in the capital of Uttar Pradesh only, and directed it to be completed in two years.Supreme Court Bench in its ruling said the case should be tried in a time-bound, day-to-day basis, without any adjournments or transfer of trial judge. Union Minister Uma Bharti is also among the accused who will be tried for criminal conspiracy. Rajasthan Governor Kalyan Singh has been exempted from trial due to constitutional immunity under Article 361. No case would be registered against him when he is the Governor; trial will begin once he steps down.It also directed probe agency CBI to ensure that prosecution witnesses appear on each and every date for recording of evidence in the case and the trial court should start the proceedings within four weeks from this date.A Special Court had in May 2001 dropped the criminal conspiracy charges against Mr. Advani and top BJP and Sangh Parivar leaders, including Ashok Singhal, Giriraj Kishore, Murli Manohar Joshi, and Uma Bharti among others. The Allahabad HC had dismissed the CBI plea to revive the conspiracy charges in May 2010, following which the agency moved the Supreme Court in appeal in February 2011.There were two sets of cases relating to the demolition of the disputed structure on December 6, 1992. The first involved unnamed ‘karsevaks’, the trial of which is taking place in a Lucknow court, while the second set of cases relate to the VVIPs in a Rae Bareli court.On April 6, the bench had indicated that they may order holding of joint trial of the two sets of cases by transferring the trial from Rae Bareli to the Lucknow court. Senior Advocate K K Venugopal, appearing for Advani and Joshi, had vociferously opposed the proposal for holding joint trial and transferring their case from Rae Bareli to Lucknow.The CBI had clarified that it was not making any submission on the issue of the trial of the VVIPs accused but restricting itself to restoration of the charge of conspiracy against them.The apex court had earlier decided to examine the appeal against dropping of conspiracy charge against Advani, Joshi, Uma Bharti and 10 others.CBI had charged Advani and 20 others under sections 153A (promoting enmity between classes), 153B (imputations, assertions prejudicial to national integration) and 505 (false statements, rumours etc circulated with the intent to cause mutiny or disturb public peace) of the IPC.

    "data": "IMMIGRATION AND CITIZENSHIP IN INDIA-“Except one other article in the draft constitution, I do not think that any other article has given the drafting committee such a headache as this particular article. I do not know how many drafts were prepared and how many were destroyed as being inadequate to cover all the cases which it was thought necessary and desirable to cover.”-Dr. B.R Ambedkar Although human migration has existed for hundreds of thousands of years, immigration in the modern sense refers to movement of people from one nation-state to another, where they are not citizens. Immigration implies long-term permanent residence by the immigrants.[1] In India, during the partition, there were movement of many non-citizens and citizens of India; it was very difficult to demarcate the citizens of the country. The need of Immigration and citizenship laws was emerged. The objective of the Immigration is to gain nationality and citizenship of other country. Laws related to immigration and citizenship is governed by The Constitution of India under Part II, certain rights of the citizenship and migrants are also given under the same part. Article 5 states that at the commencement of this Constitution, every person who was born in the territory of India or either of whose parents are born within the territory of India or who has been ordinarily resident in the territory of India for not less than five years immediately preceding such commencement and who has his domicile in the territory of India, shall be a citizen of India.[2]THE CITIZENSHIP ACT, 1955-The Act provides for acquisition of Indian Citizenship after the commencement of the Constitution. It has necessary provisions for the termination or deprivation of citizenship in certain circumstances. Only a natural person can be a citizen. The act provides the ways to acquire Indian citizenship i.e by birth or by registration or by descent or by naturalization. Section 3 of the said act provides for citizenship by birth. Section 5 deals with citizens by registration. The following can register under the said section i.e. persons of Indian origin who are ordinarily resident outside undivided India or women married to Indian citizens or minor children of Indian Citizens, provided that the registration certificate given under section 5 of the said act cannot be cancelled[3]. Section 7 provides for citizenship by naturalization.In case of Ghural Hasan v. State of Rajasthan[4], it was held that the citizenship obtained by means of fraud, false representation or concealment of any material fact can be result in the cancellation of the citizenship under section 10 of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955. In relation to the foreigners, the government is vested with unlimited powers to expel any foreigner from the country without assigning any reason[5]. Right to reside and settle in India conferred under Article 19(1)(d) is only available to the citizens of India.[6]THE CITIZENSHIP (AMENDMENT) BILL, 2016-The Citizenship Amendment Bill, 2016 seeks to allow illegal migrants belonging to the Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian religious communities coming from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan to not be imprisoned or deported. Also, the aggregate period of residence or service of a Government in India as required under this clause shall be read as “not less than six years” in place of “not less than eleven years. Furthermore the provision is to be added to cancel the registration of the Overseas Citizen of India cardholders in case of violation of the provisions of the Act or any other law for the time being in force. Since the act makes provisions only for six communities from three countries and excludes Muslims, Jews, Atheists and others; and thus raises a question if it would violate the Article 14 (right to equality and discrimination on the basis of religion). Civil society groups held a protest rally in New Delhi on Thursday opposing the Citizenship (Amendment) Bill, 2016, terming it “communally motivated humanitarianism.”[7] There were also protests in Assam because of the proposed amendment act which is contradictory to the Assam Accord which was also added under the Citizenship Act by the amendment of 1985 under section 6A of the Indian Citizenship Act, 1955.[8]Earlier, there have been a number of amendments in the Citizenship Act, 1955; if the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2016 comes into force then it will be the 6th Amendment. With such enactment, it can result in communal violence as Muslims who migrated to Assam from East Bengal a century ago would continue to be harassed as illegal migrants from Bangladesh and the Hindu who migrated to Assam will become citizens, this will result in inequality which may motivate violence amongst communities.India is a secular state which doesn’t discriminate between religious denominations. A rational and sophisticated citizenship programme for refugees needs to be egalitarian and operate on a case-by-case basis. A policy that favors specific religious denominations reeks of the discredited two-nation theory.

    "headline": "Moot Court Preparation Course4 New Supreme Court Judges Appointed by President of IndiaRESIDUAL DOUBT THEORY: AN ADDITION TO INDIAN CAPITAL SENTENCE JURISPRUDENCETANZANIA CASE: A REFUGE OR PERIL",
    "data": "Moot court is a simulated oral argument, similar to an argument made before an appellate court. The argument lasts around fifteen minutes, during which time the attorney presents an argument and answers questions posed by the panel of judges. It is not a trial: there are no witnesses and no evidence. The arguments are evaluated on the application of the law to the facts of the case.An oral argument is a part of the appeals process which consists of one party asking the court to uphold or overturn a lower court’s decision. An appeal occurs after there has been a full trial and a final judgment on the case in the lower courts. In these instances, the losing party finds a reason why the trial court and/or the intermediate appeals court’s decision was wrong and is seeking to have the lower courts’ decision overturned by the higher court, Supreme Court. The winning party, then has the opportunity to defend the lower court’s decision on that issue.At the appellate level, an oral argument is the only opportunity for a lawyer to argue his/her client’s case in person before the court. This argument is limited to the issues raised in their brief and the facts of the case determined in the lower trial court. The argument is made solely by lawyers before a panel of judges.The purpose of an oral argument is for the attorney to answer questions of the judges about their argument submitted in their brief. And, to make sure the judges understand and focus on the claims made. A good oral argument will point out the essential elements of the case, highlight the brief and explain why the judge should rule in the favor of their client. Moot Court involves an oral argument appealing a case that has already been heard by a district court. It is not a mock trial; there are no witnesses and no objections. Although the Petitioner will have the opportunity to make a brief rebuttal, it is not a debate.Oral argument is when attorneys actually argue in front of an appellate court. Moot court is the same thing, except that it is when students are simulating what an oral argument would be like in an actual court. Mock Trial is the actual trial that takes place before the possibility of an appellate argument can even be considered, complete with witnesses, exhibits to be entered into evidence, and a jury who will decide the final verdict. In Mock Trial, the attorneys on both sides are attempting to convince a jury, comprised of citizens, not judges, most of the time there are 12 jurors, as to who is responsible or not responsible, guilty or not guilty. In an oral argument, the attorneys are arguing a legal issue to a panel of 3 -9 judges about whether or not the lower court made the right decision according to what the law states.When a case is first filed, it will first go to trial court where all the facts will be determined, by a jury, through the presentation of evidence and through the testimony of witnesses. The record from that trial is preserved for appeal. Moot Court oral arguments are what happens at the next level of the judicial process, after a trial is finished, and a jury has set a verdict, the appellate court. The appellate court relies on the facts that came out at the trial level, on appeal, the attorneys get to present their legal arguments for their sides and the judges will interrupt them to ask questions, to get a better understanding of the issue and the arguments being made.

    "data": "Divisional Bench Justices Sanjay Harkauli and Amreshwar Pratap Sahi Uttar Pradesh government led by Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath continuing crackdown/ ban on illegal slaughterhouses in the state. The Lucknow bench of Allahabad High Court said that no one can impose the complete prohibition on beef as it affects the traders and consumers, “Choice of food is part of right to life”. Article 21 of the Indian Constitution was also raised by the court right to life to every citizen. As food habits in the state is connected with the right to life and livelihood. On April 3rd Statement from the Allahabad High court “To provide an immediate check on unlawful activity should be simultaneous with facilitating the carrying of lawful activity, particularly that relating to food, food habits and vending thereof that is undisputedly connected with the right to life and livelihood. Food that is conducive to health cannot be treated as a wrong choice.”The court has also considered of what the Bombay HC had said on the Maharashtra beef ban about a year ago, that “As far as the choice of eating food of the citizens is concerned, the citizens are required to be let alone especially when the food of their choice is not injurious to health. The state cannot make an intrusion into his home and prevent a citizen from possessing and eating food of his choice.”Those people who consume non- veg as their daily food the ban has taken away their daily food and as UP is the biggest meat exporter, thousands of people had lost their job and the revenue loss will be continued to thousands of crores if the ban will not be cancelled. The Lucknow bench of Allahabad HC had given the time till 13th April 2017 to make sure that its crackdown does not deprive the people from their livelihood on unlicensed slaughterhouses.On Monday a petition filed by the meat seller owner of Lakhimpur Kheri that the government is not renewing the license on beef selling. The judges directed and request for “grant of renewal of his existing licence and pass an appropriate order within one week” and “inform the court about the same by filing an appropriate affidavit” the court has also directed the government to solve the issue of granting and renewing the licenses of slaughterhouses.There was also the criticism that the government is not against the slaughterhouses but to those who are illegally managing it and continuing the meat processing. They were not closing all the slaughterhouses and meat shops but just wanted them to be regulated properly and in the authorized manner.At last the meat sellers went on a strike to call of the Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath’s assurance to renew the licenses within the framework of the law.This week, Nagaland BJP chief Visasolie Lhoungu told the Hindustan Times, “Ban on cow slaughter like the one in UP won’t take effect in Nagaland if our party comes to power next year. The reality here is very different and our central leaders are aware of that.” Reacting to this and the Yogi Adityanath government’s drive to strictly enforce Uttar Pradesh’s ban on cow slaughter, Owaisi said the BJP’s hypocrisy is that in Uttar Pradesh cow is revered as a mother but in the Northeast it is the animal’s meat is part of the normal diet.

    "data": "A person of 26 years had aspirations of making a career in medical line but the dreams were crashed because the entrance examination had age limits. No more dreams would be crashing now as the Supreme Court has extended the age limit to above 25 years to appear or the NEET examination and given a blow to CBSE’s cap on upper age.The court has extended the form filling dates to 5th April.The bench has ordered for the publicity of extension of age limit but A bench of Justice Dipak Mishra and Justice A M Khanwilkar has clarified that the order passed won’t be applicable the students appearing for the exam this year.MCI (Medical Council of India) Executive Committee Vice President Dr. C V Bhirmanandam said that MCI is not against the larger interest of medical aspirants and would like to give more such opportunities to students who would like to appear for the examination.Dr. Anand Rai who was spearheading the petition against the forceful imposition of upper age limit in the NEET application, seemed happy with the u-turn of events when the MCI argued in the favor of age limit before the court.“Our good intent has forced the government and MCI to stand down once again. An aspirant who wants to get into the noble profession of a doctor should not be limited by an age barrier” Said Dr. RaiHowever Senior Advocate Amerendra Sharan has told the bench that the CBSE notifications were very unreasonable.In January 2017, the Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) announced that the aspirants have to be at least 17 and not over 25 years old to give the NEET paper. It was also announced that the students would be given only 3 attempts to crack the NEET exam. Apparently, the reason for this decision was taken to ensure that older candidates do not compete with younger candidates. The decision has also been taken to ensure that the fraudulent practices can be curbed and the cases of cheating can be prevented.Counsel for CBSE, Advocate C K Singh has countered the argument saying the formalities for the exam had already been finalized and “it would take a huge amount of effort to redo the entire exercise.”The court, rejected CBSE’s submission and has directed that online notifications regarding the no upper age limit and extension of date should be floated by the evening of 1st April 2017.The exams are to be conducted on 7th May 2017 and the time line of extension of application is on 5th April 2017.

    "data": "The Ayodhya dispute is a political, historical and socio-religious debate in India, centred on a plot of land in the city of Ayodhya, located in Faizabad district, Uttar Pradesh. The main issues revolve around access to a site traditionally regarded among Hindus to be the birthplace of the Hindu deity Rama, the history and location of the Babri Mosque at the site, and whether a previous Hindu temple was demolished or modified to create the mosque.The Babri Mosque was destroyed during a political rally which turned into a riot on 6 December 1992. A subsequent land title case was lodged in the Allahabad High Court, the verdict of which was pronounced on 30 September 2010. In the landmark hearing, the three judges of The Allahabad High Court ruled that the 2.77 acres (1.12 ha) of Ayodhya land be divided into 3 parts, with 1/3 going to the Ram Lalla or Infant Rama represented by the Hindu Maha Sabha for the construction of the Ram temple, 1/3 going to the Islamic Sunni Waqf Board and the remaining 1/3 going to a Hindu religious denomination Nirmohi Akhara. While the three-judge bench was not unanimous that the disputed structure was constructed after demolition of a temple, it did agree that a temple or a temple structure predated the mosque at the same site. The excavations by the Archaeological Survey of India were heavily used as evidence by the court that the predating structure was a massive Hindu religious building.So, the debate is on what could be the probable solution to the issue. Should Ram Mandir be built? Can Babri Masjid be relocated? Will Ram Mandir be made? Will the Supreme Court allow construction of Ram Mandir? What should be the decision of Supreme Court? Join us in the debate from 31st March 8.00 am to 1st April 8.00 am on this topic. Comment your views in the comment box. "

    "data": "Advocates would go on a nationwide strike on 31 March, 2017 against the Law Commission on the call of Bar Council of India for the sake of some immediate changes in the Advocate Act 1961. Lawyers all over India will abstain from work on March 31 to protest against a proposed bill that bars advocates from going on strike, as announced on March 27, 2017. The 266th report titled “The Advocate’s Act 1961” as submitted by the Law Commission called attention to the need of reviewing Regulatory Mechanism and Regulatory bodies etc., and proposed wide ranging amendments in the Advocates Act and continued with the submission of a draft of Advocate (Amendment) Bill, 2017. Bar Council of India (BCI) Chairman Manan Kumar Mishra said the proposed amendments by the Law Commission in the Advocates Act were “draconian, anti-lawyer, unconstitutional, undemocratic and anti-people”.The recommendations of the Law Commission are against the legal profession and legal education of the country is in danger because of this proposed bill,” Mishra said. The regulation and control of legal profession and legal education is proposed to be handed over to non-lawyers and the advocates will have to face the disciplinary proceedings before people not connected with the legal profession. In Mahipal Singh Rana vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (July, 2016), as mentioned in the report prepared by the law commission, the court had observed that there is an urgent need to review the provisions of the Advocates Act dealing with regulatory mechanism for the legal profession. The commission also threw light on differentiating between genuine and fake lawyers and suggested that the lawyers practicing either with fake or no degree can only be recognized by scrutiny. Law Commission recommends a specific rule making power for Bar Council of India to make rules for verification of certificates of Advocates and for periodical verification of antecedents, conduct, place of practice of Advocates; and to make a data based web-portal of all the advocates.To avoid the inconvenience faced by fresh graduates in superior courts, the Commission recommended a specific clause in section 7(1) of the Advocates Act to provide for the rule making power of the Bar Council of India for pre-enrolment training and apprenticeship before the induction of a person as an advocate. The Commission has also observed that the law colleges require transformation in infrastructure and resources along with good library facilities.The Bar Council said there were chances that charted accountants, architects, politicians, doctors and others would dominate the Bar Council due to the proposed legislation. It said the Commission appeared to have acted hurriedly without considering the recommendations of the BCI and instead considered the suggestions of only non-lawyers. In a nutshell, the Council is of the unanimous opinion that the autonomy, democracy and the mandate of the Constitution of the country are proposed to be throttled by the said bill.We are looking forward for the coming situations and could not marginalize the amount of loss suffered due to this call for strike. Judicial work in Delhi was paralysed on March 23 when some 6,000 lawyers went on strike to protest against suggestions that lawyers should be banned from going on strike and slapped with penalties if they do. And sarcastically this time it is even on a large scale. Fingers crossed for the upcoming situations and let’s see who will be in the real loss: the system or the people!!!

    "data": "A number of companies and individuals have adopted fraudulent ways to gain unnatural advantages, since time immemorial. In the broadest sense, a fraud is an intentional deception made for personal gain or to cause damage to another person or entity. It includes any wrongful or criminal deception to obtain similar results. Frauds in the corporate sector consists of activities engaged into by an individual or a company, that are done in an illegal or dishonest manner, with the object to give an undue advantage to the perpetrating company or individual.Frauds in corporate worlds can be of a number of types. The classification goes as below:Fraudulent Financial Statements: – financial statement fraud is deliberate misrepresentation, misstatement or omission of financial statement data for the purpose of misleading the reader and creating a false impression of an organization’s financial strength. Public and private businesses commit financial frauds to secure investor interests or obtain bank approvals for financing, as justifications for bonuses or increased salaries or to meet expectations of shareholders. Upper management is usually at the centre of Financial Statement frauds, because financial statements are created at the management level.Employee Fraud: – internal or employee frauds are when frauds are committed against a company or organisation by a person who is working for such company or organisation. Employee frauds include:Vendor Fraud: – vendor frauds involve fraud schemes in which the company’s accounts payable and payment systems are manipulated for the fraudster for his illegal personal gain. Vendor frauds cover a broad spectrum of schemes, which can be classified into two groups- firstly, fraud committed by vendor acting alone. And secondly, fraud committed by vendor and defrauded organization’s employees jointly. Common vendor fraud schemes include:Customer Fraud: – these are deceptive practises that results in financial or other loses for the consumers in the seemingly legitimate business transactions.Investment Scams: – investment Scams or frauds are of the following types-Bankruptcy Fraud: – Bankruptcy fraud is a white-collar crime that takes four general forms- first, debtors conceal assets to avoid having to conceal them. Second, individuals intentionally files false or incomplete forms. Third, individuals sometimes file multiple times using either false information or real information in several states. The fourth kind of bankruptcy fraud involves bribing a court-appointed trustee. MAJOR CORPORATE FRAUDSOut of the numerous instances of frauds in corporate world, some major cases of corporate frauds in India can be laid down as below:Mundhra Scam: – In the year of 1957, took place independent India’s first big financial scam. It was called the Mundhra Scandal. Haridas Mundhra, a Calcutta based industrialist and stick speculator got the Life Insurance Corporation of India to invest a sum of Rupees 1,26,86,100 in the shares of six of his troubled companies. This investment was done under government pressure and without consulting LIC’s investment company.Mr. Jawaharlal Nehru set up a one-man commission headed by Justice Chagla to investigate into the matter. Justice Chagla submitted his report within twenty- four days, on the basis of which Mundhra was found guilty and was sentenced to imprisonment for 22 years.Satyam Fraud: – The Satyam Scam is the biggest corporate scam in India, that has come from one of the respected business families. Satyam Computer Services is the fourth largest I.T. Company listed in India and U.S. It was established in mid 1980s, and grown to 53,000 employees. It had operations in 66 countries throughout the globe.The scandal broke in 2009 when the founder-chairman of Satyam Computers, Ramalinga Raju confessed that the company’s accounts have been tampered with. He disclosed a 7000 rupees’ accounts fraud in the balance sheets. The 10-people found guilty in the case are- B. Ramalinga Raju; his brother and former Managing Director B. Rama Raju; former chief financial officer Valdamani Srinivas; former PwC auditors Subramani Gopalkrishnan and T. Srinivas; Raju’s another brother, B. Suryanarayana Raju; former employees G. Ramakrishna, D. Venkatapati Raju and Ch. Srisailam; and Satyam’s former internal chief auditor V.S. Prabhakar Gupta. Harshad Mehta Scam: – Harshad Mehta was an Indian stockbroker, well known for his wealth and for having been charged with numerous financial crimes that took place in 1992. Of the 27 criminal charges brought against him, he was only convicted of four before his death at the age of 47 in the year 2001. It was alleged that Mehta engaged in a massive stock manipulation scheme financed by worthless Bank Receipts, which his firm brokered in “ready forward” transactions between banks. Mehta obtained small Bank Receipts from small banks. The said Bank Receipts were passed on to other banks as security to obtain cash. This money was used to drive up the money in stock market. when this bubble of stock market manipulation and fake Bank Receipts were busted, it drastically impacted the Stock Market, Economy and progress og the Country. Banking system was swindled of a whooping Rupees 4000 crores. Conclusion:A survey on fraud on 2010 shows that, as per the World bank estimates, bribes paid globally aggregates to over USD 1 trillion per annum. In India, the reasons for bribes are for obtaining routine administrative approvals and attempts to win/retain business.In India, there are a number if legislations that provide rules against frauds- However, it entirely depends on the people and the business to check the frauds in corporate world. In a company, it is the management level who is to be blamed for all the wrongful acts. The management encourages fraud in a number of ways. The responsibility, accountability and authority is not established or documented. In many cases there are no written policies or procedures. The inconsistent application policies and procedures may result in unfair dealings.Fraud must be stopped at the very root level. Apart from stringent rules and regulations by the Government, the companies need to work in a more ethical and strict ways to prevent fraud. There must be string ethical value in organizations, flowing from the top. The recruitment process must be proper and thorough, leading o selection of right people on appointment. Reference check and verification should be carried on. There must be transparency in the dealings and proper Internal Control System.

The scheme collapses when money owed to previous investors is greater than the money that can be raised from the new ones.

    "data": "There is hardly any other malady of greater magnitude, which the society is facing today than the curse of dowry demand and dowry death. It is commonly talked of in the society that the newly married wife is expected to be a gold mine, failing which they treat her as combustible material, and because of this cruel behavior, the girl, who comes to the matrimonial home with great expectations and dreams, has to resort to suicide or be burnt alive by the in-laws.It is ironic that in India dowry was originally designed to safeguard the woman and it was the provision of ” Streedhan” (“Stree” meaning woman and “dhan” meaning wealth) in the form of money, property or gifts given solely to the woman by her parents at the time of her marriage. “Streedhan”, an inheritance was meant to exclusively belong to the woman at the time of her marriage. The abuse of this custom eroded and aborted the original meaningful function of dowry as a safety net for the woman and was corrupted to become the price tag for the groom and consequently the noose for the bride.The Indian Criminal laws were comprehensively amended to include dowry as a punishable offence under section 304-B was added to the Indian Penal Code, 1860 which made dowry death a specific offence punishable with a minimum sentence of imprisonment for 7 years and a maximum imprisonment for life. The IPC also punishes bride burning, cruelty and torture to brides. Section 498-A is a strong prohibition in this code. Section 198-A of Criminal Procedure Code fixes the procedure for such provisions. The Indian evidence Act also provides that the accused has to take the burden of proof.In addition to this the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was passed. Even though now days many dowry harassment cases has been reported. This is the reason why dowry death, dowry torture and dowry harassment has not been eradicated. The provision of the Act says that any person who gives or take or abets the giving or taking dowry shall be punished with imprisonment or fine or both.Besides the central Dowry Act, the state govt. has enacted their own provisions for direct and indirect effort to prohibit dowry.When a case involves a suicide by a woman within 7 years of marriage the court will presume that the accused is guilty of abatement of suicide and magistrate can hold an enquiry on his own apart from the police enquiry.The flaw in the lawAs per the Dowry Prohibition Act, dowry is forbidden but ‘gifts’ are allowed. The anti-dowry law cannot be invoked against the giving of presents at the time of marriage to the bride without any demand having been made ‘provided that such presents are entered in a list maintained in accordance with the rules’ as defined under the Act. “But who decides what is a ‘voluntary gift’ and what is given under pressure of a demand?” asks Madhu Kishwar, the founder president of Manushi Sangathan, a forum for research-based advocacy for promotion of social justice and human rights. “And how do you decide what is ‘excessive’ in relation to income by way of gifts when in India no more than two to three per cent people declare their incomes and those too are grossly under-reported? When giving dowry is a crime, why would a groom or bride’s family put their signature on the list of gifts being given?”Making dowry ‘legal’ After declaring that giving or taking of dowry is illegal, the Act adds an ambiguous clause, that ‘where any dowry is received by any person other than the woman in connection with whose marriage it is given, that person will transfer the dowry to the woman within three months after the date of marriage or within three months after the date of receipt’. Failure to transfer a woman’s dowry invites imprisonment for not less than six months and a fine of Rs.10,000. In Sanju’s case, this would have meant financial security and even a kind of insurance against dowry harassment from her in-laws.“The only effect of the anti-dowry law and campaign has been that the giving and taking has become more surreptitious,” says Madhu. Earlier, families ensured that proper lists and accounts were prepared and the groom’s family was made to sign the list of things they received while the dowry itself was put on display for all the relatives to take note of so there were numerous witnesses to the transaction. Today, no lists are signed and most of the giving and receiving is shrouded in secrecy.MALIMATH COMMITTEE REPORTThis committee has suggested to make certain changes to the already existing anti dowry law. Firstly they have put forward the idea of making this offence as a non compoundable offence which allows the out of the court settlement in such cases which lead to hugely comedown of the misuse of this offence as there would be scope of initiating a settlement by the wife and in such cases a marriage could be saved. It has been also suggested to make it a bailable offence. The amendment has also increased the fine to 15000 from 1000 if the complaint lodged turn outs to be false.CONCLUSIONEvery coin has 2 sides so is the case in law. Law that are made at some point of time has its own importance and brings with its some pros and cons, and generally when a law is made to safeguard a particular section of the society its mostly misused also by the same set of people taking un due advantages of the benefits provided to them. The misuse of law doesn’t makes the law wrong as a whole but yes with time some amendments should made so that the law is enforced more efficiently and its serves benefit to the maximum number of people. But what must be taken into consideration by the women is that these laws were originally framed for the protection of those women who suffer domestic violence and torture and were demanded for dowry, therefore others should restrain from misusing it for the sake of the ones who really need it.It’s time to see the other side of the coin were men are the victims and due to misuse of such laws at times they have to pay heavy price. Suicide of a wife due to harassments is an issue of concern so is the suicide of the husband as even they are tortured and “husband beating” as term should be a matter of concern. Many males are traumatized and put through mental torture and harassment which leads them to end their lives.Amendments in the law of anti-dowry thus should be made that protect men and women both from any trauma and any sort of violence. Awareness should be spread amongst men and women both who tell them the provision and remedies and safeguards their rights, in doing so NGOs, law students play a very important role. Offence under the section 498a of IPC should be made compoundable and non-bailable and section 41 and 41A OF Crpc should also be taken into consideration while looking into such kind of matters.

    "data": "First of all, Team Legge Rhythms wishes you a Very Happy Consumer Right’s Day.15 March is World Consumer Rights Day (WCRD), an annual occasion for celebration and solidarity within the international consumer movement. It marks the date in 1962 President John F Kennedy first outlined the definition of Consumer Rights.Consumer rights are protected under consumer protection act,India.Consumer rights are protected under consumer protection act, India. Although almost everyone is aware of his social responsibilities even then we come across many cases of consumer exploitation. Then people ask government what they are doing to prevent their citizens from consumer frauds, exploitation, etc. To all who blame government should know that they all have their consumer rights equally to protect them from exploitation.Now, what are the rights the GOI is providing to all of us are as follows : 1. Right to safetyAccording to this right the consumers have the right to be protected against the marketing of goods and services which are hazardous to life and property, this right is important for safe and secure life. This right includes concern for consumer’s long term interest as well as for their present requirement.Sometimes the manufacturing defects in pressure cookers, gas cylinders and other electrical appliances may cause loss to life, health and property of customers. This right to safety protects the consumer from sale of such hazardous goods or services. 2. Right to Information: According to this right the consumer has the right to get information about the quality, quantity, purity, standard and price of goods or service so as to protect himself against the abusive and unfair practices. The producer must supply all the relevant information at a suitable place.3. Right to Choice:According to this right every consumer has the right to choose the goods or services of his or her likings. The right to choose means an assurance of availability, ability and access to a variety of products and services at competitive price and competitive price means just or fair price.4. Right to be Heard or Right to Representation: According to this right the consumer has the right to represent him or to be heard or right to advocate his interest. In case a consumer has been exploited or has any complaint against the product or service then he has the right to be heard and be assured that his/her interest would receive due consideration.This right includes the right to representation in the government and in other policy making bodies. Under this right the companies must have complaint cells to attend the complaints of customers. 5.

This right assures justice to consumer against exploitation. The right to redressal includes compensation in the form of money or replacement of goods or repair of defect in the goods as per the satisfaction of consumer. Various redressal forums are set up by the government at national level and state level.6. Right to Consumer Education:According to this right it is the right of consumer to acquire the knowledge and skills to be informed to customers. It is easier for literate consumers to know their rights and take actions but this right assures that illiterate consumer can seek information about the existing acts and agencies are set up for their protection. The government of India has included consumer education in the school curriculum and in various university courses. Government is also making use of media to make the consumers aware of their rights and make wise use of their money. So, we wish that this consumer day, you get to know all your rights and become alert. Let both the consumer and seller beware. Think before buy Fırst think, then buy! Open your mind; open your eyes before opening your wallet. Think more than buy. Think twice before shopping.Don’t buy what you don’t need. That steals from you! To resist the temptation to buy more when you need less.Your value, your product Product, Consumer, Bargain- They are all common Your product, your rights. By:Harshdeep Grover "

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday ordered floor test on March 16 and refused to stay BJP leader Manohar Parrikar’s oath-taking ceremony as Goa chief ministerA bench headed by Chief Justice JS Khehar also comprising Justices Ranjan Gogoi and RK Agrawal directed that the Assembly session be called at 11 AM on March 16 and made it clear that the only business of the House would be the holding of floor test after swearing in of the members also all pre-requisites for holding the floor test be completed by tomorrow including the Election Commission related formalities.The court told Congress that instead of putting forth their arguments before the court, the party should have done so before the Governor.Over two years after he quit as Chief Minister of Goa to become the nation’s Defence Minister, Manohar Parrikar is set to take over the coastal state’s mantle again on Tuesday as the head of a BJP-led government. The decks were cleared for Parrikar to take oath as Goa Chief Minister with President Pranab Mukherjee on Monday accepting his resignation as Defence Minister and assigning additional charge of the ministry to Finance Minister Arun Jaitley.Under the leadership of Manohar Parrikar the BJP placed the number of 21 elected members to form the government. It also took on record a letter showing support of three members of MGP, three of GFP and two independents to BJP taking the party’s strength to 21 in the House of 40.Goa Congress unit had moved the SC against the Governor’s invite to appoint Parikkar as the CM. Congress’ Abhishek Manu Singhvi tells reporters after the Supreme Court hearing: “Manohar Parrikar is CM of Goa for two days, if BJP can’t show majority they won’t be allowed to form a government.”The former defence minister is expected to be sworn in as the CM in a ceremony later in the day. Supreme Court indicates holding an immediate floor test and not within 15 days as ordered by the governor.BJP’s Nitin Gadkari denies any horse-trading in Goa, says BJP discussed with non-BJP MLAs who had some conditions and that support was unanimous. “Congress was not able to choose a leader due to their internal tussle and they are blaming us for it,” he says.At 11.50 am today, Finance minister Arun Jaitley takes additional charge as defence minister.During the hearing, the bench said, “You (Congress) don’t have the numbers and that is why you did not claim to form government. You have not demonstrated before the Governor that the number is in your favour.” The court told the Congress that instead of putting forth their arguments before the court, the party should have done so before the governor.The bench also said that the pleadings of the Congress leader were not proper as they have not impleaded Manohar Parrikar, who has been invited to form the government, as a necessary party.“You (Congress) know his name (Parrikar). He has been the defence minister of the country”, the bench said and added “you don’t even implead the CM. You don’t have the affidavit of the members who are supporting you. So sensitive the matter is and you don’t do anything.”Supreme Court orders floor test on March 16 and refuses to stay today’s swearing-in ceremony of Manohar Parrikar.The bench refused the plea of Goa Congress Legislative Party (CLP) leader Chandrakant Kavlekar whose counsel and senior advocate Abhishek Mani Singhvi wanted a composite floor test before the oath taking of Parrikar as chief minister.The petition was filed on Monday evening by the CLP leader and it was mentioned at the residence of the CJI who had agreed to give an urgent hearing. A special bench was constituted as the apex court is on Holi break for a week. Besides staying Parrikar’s swearing-in, the petition has also sought quashing of the decision of the governor to appoint the BJP leader as the chief minister.The petition, filed by advocate Devdutt Kamath, has made the Centre and Goa as the parties.The Goa CLP leader has argued that the Congress emerged as the single largest party in the polls and under the constitutional convention, the Governor was bound to invite the single largest party to form the government and give it the opportunity to prove majority in the floor test.

As counting progressed, a bitter battle with the Congress became a roaring landslide. The contest was expected to be close, but the BJP scored 57 seats in the 70-member Assembly to the Congress’s 11. 2. PunjabHighlightsThe Congress has made a resounding comeback in Punjab, winning a solid 77 seats in the 117-seat Assembly. Anti-incumbency may have helped the party notch up its big score. The AAP won less than it was expected to. Still, its 20 seats on debut do make it the second largest party in the Punjab Assembly. The SAD-BJP alliance – expected to be reduced to single digits – fared the worst, with 18 seats. 3. GoaHighlightsIt’s a hung assembly in Goa. Congress and BJP need the support of MGP and Goa Forward Party to form government in the state. BJP has 13 seats and Congress is just one short of winning majority with 17 seats. 4. Manipur HighlightsThe tightest of all the Assembly state election battles, Manipur went down to the wire, with the Congress winning 28 seats to the BJP’s 21. The result however is bound to remain sweet for the BJP which has created a toehold for itself in the state, where it has not been a big force till now. 5. Uttar PradeshThere were elections happening in 5 different regions around the country, but the most awaited results which many of the citizens eagerly waiting for was the results of Uttar Pradesh, the results and key highlights are as follows:HighlightsBJP emerged victorious in Uttar Pradesh by a resounding margin – call it the ‘Modi wave’ or the ‘saffron wave’ .

    "data": "ADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICEIntroduction:Administration of justice implies the maintenance of peace and order within a political community by means of physical force of the state. It is the modern and civilized substitute for the primitive practice of private vengeance and violent self help. Physical force of the state is the prime requirement for sound administration of justice. However, there are other factors which help administration of justice and command obedience of law. It includes social sanction, public opinion, custom, convenience, etc.Notion or concept of justice:The concept of justice is as old as origin of human society itself. The social nature of man demands that he must live peacefully in society. While living so, he experienced a conflict of interest and expects rightful conduct on the part of others. This is the reason why Salmond and Roscoe Pound have emphasized the importance of justice in their definitions of law. As Salmond rightly observed, “it is through the instrumentality of law that justice is administered by the state.” Likewise, Roscoe Pound held that, “Law is a body of principles recognised and enforced by state for administration of justice.” According to Blackstone, “Justice is reservoir from where the concept of right, duty and equity evolves.” From the above thoughts of jurists, we get to know the concept of justice.Origin of administration of justice:The administration of justice in modern civilized societies has evolved through stages. In the early stage when society was primitive and private vengeance and self help were the only remedies available to wronged person against the wrongdoer. He could get is wrongs redressed with the help of his friends or relatives. The second stage of development of society was characterised by the state coming into existence in its rudimentary form when its functions were only persuasive in nature. It did not have enforcing power by which it could punish the wrongdoer to the victim who was affected by the wrongful act. Thus up to this time the justice remained private in nature without compulsive force of the state . Importance of administration of justice:The necessity of force of the state for administration of justice has been emphasized by Jeremy Taylor who observed, “a herd of wolves is quieter and more at once than so many men unless they all had one reason in them or have one power over them.” Hobbes also believed that a common power was necessary to keep people within control in the community. Force is necessary to prevent the recalcitrant minority from gaining unfair advantage over law abiding people in general. Therefore, state force is inevitable for protection of rights of individuals in society.Classification of Administration of justice:Administration of Justice Civil Criminal[Enforcement of rights] [Punishment of wrongs]I] Specific enforcement II] Sanctioned enforcement Both in civil and criminal proceedings there is a wrong. The law will enforce a right only against a person who has already violated it or who has shown an intention to do so. Justice is administered only against wrongdoers. A wrong regarded as a subject matter of civil proceedings is called a civil wrong and a wrong regarded as the subject matter of criminal proceedings is termed as a criminal wrong or a crime.Civil Justice:The administration of civil justice consists in the enforcement of rights as opposed to the punishment for wrongs. The right to enforced may either be primary or a sanctioning right.Primary rights are those rights which do not have the violation of another right. On the other hand, a sectioning right is one which arises out of the violation of another right. It is also called a remedial right because it comes into existence consequent to violation of private right. Thus one’s right not be libelled or assaulted is a primary right but right to obtain pecuniary compensation on being libelled or assaulted by some other person is a sanctioning right. Again, a right to fulfilment of a contract is primary right but right to recover damages for its breach is a sanctioning right.Purpose of civil justice:The purpose of civil justice is enforcement in civil proceedings, either a primary or a sanctioning right. A sanctioning right is one which arises out of the violation of another right.e.g., When A publishes a defamatory statement about B, there is a violation of B’s right to reputation. B’s right to damages arises out of this violation. The right to damages comes into existence as a result of or by way of sanction for a wrong done by another. It is therefore called a sanctioning right. Any other right is a primary right. In our example, the right to reputation is primary right.Criminal Justice:The administration of criminal justice is to punish the offender. Punishment may be described as the infliction by the state authority, of a consequence normally regarded as a evil. [e.g. Imprisonment or death on an individual found to be legally guilty of a crime]Purpose of criminal justice:The main purpose of administration of criminal justice is to punish the offender. It is the state who punishes the criminals. Punishment necessarily implies some kinds of pain inflicted upon the offender or loss caused to him for his criminal act which may either be intended to deter him from repeating the crime or may be an expression of society’s misappropriation for his antisocial conduct or it may also be directed to form and regenerate him and at the time ported the society from criminals.Conclusion:In determining a nation’s rank in a political organisation, no test is considered more decisive than its administration of justice, for it has been conceived as one of the firmest pillars of any government. A state may not be called a state, if it has failed to discharge its functions concerning the administration of justice. Life may not be lived in society in which there is no preservation of the rights of men and no prevention of injustice. Be that as it may, it must be stated that the advantages of administration of justice far outweigh its disadvantages and it is an effective media for establishment of rule of law in modern democracies .

Gurmehar Kaur’s trolling by politicians and celebrities, is this the way we instill fear? The twenty- year- old Gulmehar was only expressing herself and can someone see sense in what she was saying? The girl is scared and she has requested everyone to leave her alone after she received threats from all over. It is only in India that brave assertions become national liability. Freedom of speech is the bulwark of democratic government. This freedom is an essential for the proper functioning of democratic process. The freedom of speech is regarded as the first condition of liberty. It occupies a preferred position in the hierarchy of liberties giving succour and protection to all the liberties. It has been truly said that it is the mother of all other liberties.What is this Democracy like? That Gurmehar Kaur was trolled by anonymous trolls, isn’t worrying? What is worrying is that so how some of the most powerful and influential men in the country, a parliamentarian, a Union minister and even a cricketer and actor, have expressed their disapproval of what she has said, called her a terrorist, ridiculed her views and refused her agency. No one even mentioned one word defending what’s her Constitutional right or condemned the threat that she faces. Doesn’t it show that a culture of goondas is being promoted by the system?Free speech which is guaranteed by the Article 19(1)(a) and made subject to certain limitation in Article 19(2) is eesentilal to the democracy, for democracy is fundamentally based on free debate and open discussion, and a citizen has a right to exercise his right to free speech in a democracy by discerning the information and eventually making a choice and if it is curtailed by taking recourse to colonial laws and has cherished the value under the constitution of India. Article 19(1)(a) confers freedom of speech to the citizens of this country and thus this provision ensures that the petitioner s could raise slogan, albeit in a peaceful ad orderly manner, without using offensive language.Gurmehar Kaur has broken no laws. Nor has she slandered any individual on a public platform. Kaur started a social media campaign after the violence in Ramjas College on February 22. The campaign began with Kaur changing her Facebook profile picture to her holding a placard that read: “I am a student of Delhi University and I am not afraid of ABVP.” For her post, she has received graphic threats on social media.The Delhi University is usually a microcosm of the political narrative playing out in the country. It reflects as to what is the culture at the national level. It has become increasingly clear that politics of intolerance and bullying is taking over liberalism and citizen’s right to speech. The question is are we evolving as a country or going back to the medieval times where dissent was not allowed. More so a dissent from a women?In the light of the constitutional Law and several Judgements of the Hon’ble Supreme Court of India a natural conflict of opinions comes to the fore that Freedom of expression has four broad special purposes to serve:It helps an individual to attain self-fulfillment. It assists in the discovery of truth. It strengthens the capacity of an individual in participating in decision-making.It provides a mechanism by which it would be possible to establish a reasonable balance between stability and social change. All members of society would be able to form their own beliefs and communicate them freely to othersRight to ProtestProtest is a statement or action expressing disapproval of or objection to something. Hundreds of students and teachers took out a protest march at the Delhi University today against the violence which took place inside the Ramjas College premises last week. After students and teachers of Delhi University, Jawaharlal Nehru University and Jamia Millia Islamia hit the streets protesting against Akhil Bhartiya Vidyarthi Parishad (ABVP), which is blamed for the February 22 clashes, the Congress’ student wing National Students Union of India (NSUI) took out a torch march, calling it a peaceful march for their university. In Karam Singh v. Hardayal Singh, 1979 Crl. L.J. 1211; stated while on the one hand, citizens are guaranteed fundamental right of speech, right to assemble for the purpose of carrying peaceful protest processions and right of free movement, on the other hand, reasonable restrictions on such right can be put by law. Provisions of Indian Penal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, discussed above, are in the form of statutory provisions giving powers to the State to ensure that such public assemblies, protests, dharnas or marches are peaceful and they do not become ‘unlawful’. At the same time, while exercising such powers, the authorities are supposed to act within the limits of law and cannot indulge into excesses. How legal powers should be used to disperse an unruly crowd has been succinctly put by the Punjab and Haryana High Court wherein the High Court held that the prerequisites must be satisfied before a Magistrate can order use of force to disperse a crowd.Supreme Court has held that the right to peaceful protest is fundamental right under Article 19(1) \\(b). The aforesaid right is subject to reasonable restriction which is in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India as well as public order as mentions in 19(2), 19(3), (4) & (5). Holding peaceful demonstration in order to air their grievances and to see their voice is heard in the relevant quarters is the right of the people. Such right can be traced from to the fundamental freedom that is guaranteed under articles 19(1)(a), 19(1)(b) and 19(1)(c) of the constitution of India.Repute of the Constitution Article 19(1)(a) confers freedom of speech to the citizens of this country and thus this provision ensures that the petitioner s could raise slogan, albeit in a peaceful ad orderly manner, without using offensive language.Freedom of speech is the bulwark of democratic government. This freedom is an essential for the proper functioning of democratic process. The freedom of speech is regarded as the first condition of liberty. It occupies a preferred position in the hierarchy of liberties giving succour and protection to all the liberties. It has been truly said that it is the mother of all other liberties.In a democracy, freedom of speech and expression opens up channel of free discussion of issues. Freedom of speech plays a crucial role in the formation of public opinion on social, political and economic matters. Freedom of speech and expression, just as equality clause and the guarantee of life and liberty has been broadly construed by the Supreme Court from the 1950s. It has been variously described as a “basic human right” and the like. It embraces within its scope the freedom of propagation and interchange of ideas, dissemination of information which would help formation of one’s opinion and view point and debates on matter of public concernIn Mankea Gandhi vs Union Of India AIR 1978 SC 597: (1978) 1 SCC 248, Bhagwati J. has emphasized on the significance of the freedom of speech of and expression in these words;“Democracy is based essentially on free debate and open discussion, for that is the only based on corrective of government action in democratic set up. If democracy means government of the people, for the people it is obviously that every citizen must be entitled to participate in the democratic process action in order to enable him to intelligently exercise his right of making a choice free and general discussion of public matters is absolutely essential.”In Sherya Singhal vs Union Of India, SC (2015), Jasti Chelameswar and Rohinton Fali Nariman JJ. Observed that;The Preamble of the Constitution of India inter alia speaks of liberty of thought, expression, belief, faith and worship. It also says that India is a sovereign democratic republic. It cannot be over emphasized that when it comes to democracy, liberty of thought and expression is a cardinal value that is of paramount significance under our constitutional scheme.Justice Holmes in his famous dissent in Abrams v. United States, 250 US 616 (1919) said:“But when men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas-that the best test of truth is the power of thought to get itself accepted in the competition of the market, and that truth is the only ground upon which their wishes safely can be carried out. That at any rate is the theory of our Constitution.”I can assure the citizens of India through my words that so long as expression is confined to nationalism, patriotism and love for motherland one’s right to freedom of speech and expression cannot be violated or restricted.

    "headline": "HOW FAR ARE THE LAWS OF ADULTERY JUSTIFIED?COVID -19: Quarantine and your Legal RightsALL INDIA KASHMIRI SAMAJ AND OTHERS V. UNION OF INDIA & ANOTHERDISCUSSION HOUR: DEMONETIZATION",
    "data": "Normally, the sanctity of a matrimonial home is considered paramount in justification of an offence. This usually results in the court overlooking certain aspects which may seem as irrational at the first glance. Sometimes, these matrimonial homes are too ashamed of infidelity in their own houses so much so that they do not report them at all, and sometimes these crimes remain unreported due to fear of injustice. One of these crimes is “adultery”.Section 497 of Indian Penal Code reads, “whoever has sexual intercourse with a person who is and whom he knows or has reason to believe to be the wife of another man, without the consent or connivance of that man, such sexual intercourse not amounting to the offence of rape, is guilty of the offence of adultery and shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years, or with fine, or with both. In such a case the wife shall not be punishable as an abettor”. It basically defines adultery as consensual sexual intercourse of a woman with a person other than her husband. The major debate surrounding this section has been that it is violative of Article 14 of the Constitution of India because it discriminates the adulterers on the basis of sex.Over the years courts have given justifications regarding this matter and different aspects regarding the discrimination have risen from the dust. This contention was first addressed in the case of Yusuf Abdul Aziz v State of Bombay in which the plaintiff, Yusuf Abdul Aziz said that Section 497 of the Indian Penal Code was unconstitutional as it violated Article 14 and 15 of the Constitution holding only men responsible for the offence of adultery. The High Court had upheld the constitutionality of the section by reasoning that the condition of women in this country was such that special legislation was required to alleviate their position. And if women were indulging in adultery it was because they were weak-willed and could easily by lured by men.However meaningful and righteous (or supposedly chauvinist) this judgement might have been, we have to admit to the fact that it was still the mid-20th century and India was still recovering from the erstwhile siege of the British rule. The scenario now has changed completely and for the better. Now, women can claim their rights in ancestral property, enjoy reservation in certain areas, occupy high positions in companies and in some cases, although less proportionately, are the breadwinners of the family. Apart from these, the society is filled with ideals of women education, women empowerment, equal opportunities in employment, equal pay for equal work, feminism, et al. The position of women has changed drastically but the Indian society is still tainted by some evils which do not let them reach their full potential. Notwithstanding these evils, sometimes women enjoy unnecessary benefits due to these rustic laws.Section 497 specifically mentions that women would be exempted from charges relating to adultery. Today, women are usually of their own free will and suggesting that a third person could entice her into having sexual intercourse with him is certainly unconceivable. Also, suggesting that women are properties of their husbands is ridiculous in the sense of its equation to slavery. Besides, the fact that the third person can only be sued by the husband of the woman he had sexual intercourse with is discriminatory in itself. However, if looked into, some of these lacunae are not loopholes in themselves and can be justified to a certain extent.The Supreme Court has justified section 497 by citing several reasons. The main objective as stated earlier is preservation of a matrimonial home. The Apex court held that assuming that the right to be heard is concomitant with the principles of natural justice and believing that a trial court allows the married woman to depose her say before it records adverse findings against her, the absence of a provision mandating hearing the adulteress wife in Section 497 does not make the section unconstitutional. The Justice Malimath Committee, relegated the assignment of recommending changes in the criminal justice system of the nation, in 2003 proposed the appropriate correction of Section 497 of the IPC such that “whosoever has sexual intercourse with the spouse of any other person is guilty of adultery.” The Committee explicitly expressed: “The object of this Section (Section 497 of the IPC) is to preserve the sanctity of marriage. Society abhors marital infidelity. Therefore, there is no reason for not meting out similar treatment to the wife who has sexual intercourse with a man (other than her husband).”Upon being asked for suggestions regarding Section 497, the National Commission for Women stated that “adultery should be converted from a criminal offence, as it currently stands, to a civil offence” and that “Section 198 of the Criminal Procedure Code should be amended in order to allow women to file complaints against unfaithful husbands and prosecute them for their promiscuous behaviour.”It is conclusive from the aforementioned suggestions and decisions that laws regarding adultery are justifiable to the extent that they do not promote the breakdown of a marriage. The law is still open to question regarding the right of the wife of the adulterer to sue the adulteress, or to sue the adulterer itself. Also, its language implies that a married man could have sexual intercourse with an unmarried woman or a widow and would not be liable for adultery. Besides, the punishment of five years seems a lot for a law that seeks to save a matrimonial home. The law regarding adultery although justified to a certain extent still needs a lot of improvement. In conclusion, the law should seek to save a marriage while taking into consideration the rights of the other affected parties to sue (apart from the primary couple).Anushree Malviya,Dr. Ram Manohar Lohiya National Law University.

    "data": "The Chief Information Commission yesterday directed the government and marriage registration authorities to widely publicise with the help of media that Aadhaar is not mandatory for the purpose of marriage registration scheme. Along with this the Chief Information Commissioner Prof. M. Sridhar Acharyulu also directed the marriage registration authority to make necessary required changes for online application for solemnisation of marriage under the Special Marriage Act.The reason why this issue of Aadhar card in relation to marriage registration came to light was because an applicant submitted that the procedure for registering solemnisation of marriage under the Special Marriage Act makes Aadhaar card a mandatory document for generating receipt for 30 days’ notice, as options for other identity card is not available while applying online. This made it difficult for the newlyweds under the Special Marriage act as they were not able to legally register their marriage due to no Aadhaar card. The case of Justice K S Puttaswamy v Union of India, the Supreme Court was brought forward as it had been observed in this case that no person should suffer for the lack of an Aadhaar card. The commission said that the ruling in Writ Petition No. 494/2012: in the case of Justice K. S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India. In the said writ petition, a bench comprising Justice J. Chelameswar and J. Bobde had held in the ad-interim order of September 23, 2013 that no person should suffer for the lack of an Aadhaar card in spite of the fact that a government authority had issued a circular making it obligatory to submit the Aadhaar card to avail of certain facilities. The applicant also placed on record letter dated 24.3.2015 addressed by SDM-HQ-II to all Deputy Commissioners of Revenue Department of government of NCT of Delhi specifying that stern conformity of orders of Supreme Court in this regard was to be observed and any administrative instruction in violation of the order of Supreme Court will have no validity and will be considered as null and void.According to the commission marriage registration should be compulsory as the registration of marriages would help tackle various women’s rights infringements such as child marriage, ensuring a minimum age, marriage without the assent, bigamous unions, besides a woman’s right to live in her marital home and receive maintenance , etc.“As there is compulsion for registration of marriage; it is necessary that the government should make a convenient and well-manned infrastructure to facilitate the registration of all the marriages by appointing additional marriage officers,” the commission saidThe appeal was disposed of with these recommendations: “In pursuance to the landmark judgment, of the Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court which ruled that Aadhaar card is not necessary for availing government scheme; the public authority and government should give widespread publicity through various media that Aadhaar is not mandatory for the purpose of marriage registration scheme and also make necessary changes for online application for solemnization of marriage under the Special Marriage act.By:RADHIKA KUMAR"

    "data": "IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA,CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDDICTION CIVIL APPEAL NO. 7358 OF 2016(Arising out of SLP(C) No. 17466 OF 2016) Vijay Kumar Mishra and Another ……AppellantsVersusHigh Court of Judicature at Patna and others ……Respondents. Facts of the case:The task of the court was to explore and understand the true purpose of Article 233(2) of the Constitution of India in this appeal.The petitioners were rejected by the respondent to appear in the interview for the post of District Judge Entry Level (Direct from Bar) Examination 2015. The petitioners were members of Subordinate Judicial Service of the State of Bihar and the respondents imposed the condition upon them that they have to tender their resignation to the Subordinate Judicial Service before appearing in the aforementioned interview. The advertisement inviting applications from eligible advocates for the examination was issued on 31st March, 2015. The cut-off date for the eligibility was 5th February, 2015. In pursuant to such advertisement, the petitioners appeared in the preliminary as well as the mains examinations.In the meantime, they qualified for the Subordinate Judicial Service of the State of Bihar and accordingly joined such service in August, 2015. In January 2016, it was found out from the results of the Mains Examination of the District Judge Entry Level (Direct from Bar) examination that the petitioners qualified in it. The last step of the selection process was an interview and one of the conditions in the interview was ‘a no-objection certificate of the employer’. Thereafter, the petitioners filed their representation before the Registrar General, Patna High Court, to appear in the interview but the same was rejected on the grounds that they were already in the State Subordinate Judicial Service and in view of Article 233(2) they cannot be permitted to appear for the interview. Article 233(2)(3) declares that only a person not already in the service of either the Union or of the State shall be eligible to be appointed as District Judges.However, the respondents mentioned that the petitioners may resign their post before appearing in the interview with the warning that such resignation was not liable to be withdrawn later.This letter became the subject matter of challenge in the present writ application wherein the petitioners claim that since they were eligible on the date of inviting applications, the action of the High Court in not permitting them to appear in the interview is illegal.The respondents dismissed the challenge on the ground that to permit the appellants to participate in the interview would be a violation of Article 233(2) of the Constitution. Therefore, they are not eligible to seek appointment as District Judge.Thereafter, the petitioners filed for appeal in the Supreme Court. Issues:The Supreme Court expressly stated in the case that the appeal was for the consideration of the true object, purpose and scope of Article 233(2) of the Constitution of India and in particular, the words “eligible to be appointed as District Judge’ occurring in the Article. Therefore, the real question which arises in the case is whether the bar under Article 233(2) is only for the appointment or even for the participation in the selection process. Decision:The two-judge bench comprising of Chelameswar J. and A.M Sapre J. in a concurring judgment decided in favour of the appellants and granted leave to appeal. Consequently, the writ petition filed by the appellants was also allowed directing the respondents to permit the appellants to participate in the selection process without insisting upon their resignation from current employment. If the appellants succeed in the interview, it will be left to their choice whether they want to opt for the post of District Judge or remain in the current employment. Reasoning: Abhay Manohar Sapre J. in his concurring judgment added the following points: – Analysis:It is imperative to interpret the true meaning and purpose of every statute so as to remove all traces of injustice liable to be caused to the citizens. In this case the honourable Supreme Court aptly did that job to give the petitioner a fair chance of securing a better employment without having to let go of the current one. The learned Judges were right to point out the simple fact that even if the petitioner were under the employment of the State Government, still they were liable to participate in the selection process for becoming a District Judge. It would have been a gross miscarriage of justice if their candidature was cancelled or if they were forced to resign from their current employment in order to participate in the selection process. By:Pallavi RayChelameswar J. expressly stated that the entire inquiry before the High Court was misdirected as the High Court failed to examine and interpret the true meaning of the aforementioned provision of the Constitution. The insistence of the High Court to resign from their current post is unjust and cruel for the petitioners in the view of the fact that if they accepted the advice and subsequently failed to secure the position as District Judge, it will be a matter of life-long regret for them.It is well settled in law that there is a distinction between selection and appointment. Textually Article 233(2) only prohibits the appointment of a person who is already in the service of the Union or the State, but not the selection of such a person. The right of such a person to participate in the selection process undertaken by the state for the post of any public service can be considered as a fundamental right guaranteed under Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution.The eligibility of a person applying for the post of district judge has to be seen in the context of his appointment. Whether the candidate is in the service of the Union or State is required to be seen at the time of his appointment for the post and not prior to it.Though the respondents contended that the word ‘appointed’ used in Article 233(2) should include the entire selection process till the date of his appointment, the learned Judge refused to accept this contention and stated that when the framers of the Constitution has used the term “appointed” for determining the eligibility of a person, it cannot be read to include the words “selection”, “recruitment”, or “recruitment process”."

    "data": "The Supreme Court today clarified that one need not or no one can be compelled to stand up in attention position if the national anthem is played in a movie or a documentary. Modifying its earlier order ordering that everybody must stand while the national anthem is played in theatres, the Supreme Court today said the audience need not stand if the anthem is part of a film. “It is clarified that when the national anthem is played as part of the storyline of a film, newsreel or a documentary the audience need not stand,” the court said. According to the apex court it is not compulsory to sing the national anthem in cinema halls. There is also no need to stand up if it is a part of film.On November 30 last year, the Supreme Court had ordered cinema halls across the nation to mandatorily play the national anthem before screening of a movie and the audience must stand and show respect. A bench of Justices Dipak Misra and Amitava Roy had observed that “The time has come when citizens must realize they live in a nation and are duty-bound to show respect to National Anthem which is a symbol of constitutional patriotism and inherent national quality.” The ruling was based on a petition by Shyam Narayan Chouksey, who runs an NGO in Bhopal.“Citizens are duty-bound to show respect to the national anthem which is the symbol of the constitutional patriotism,” the top court had said in the order. “The love and respect for the motherland is reflected when one shows respect to the National Anthem as well as to the National Flag,” the judges commented. Attorney General Mukul Rohatgi submitted before the court that the home ministry on the directions of the court has issued guidelines on how people with disabilities can show respect when the national anthem is being played in movie halls or public functions, saying they should not move and position themselves “maintaining the maximum possible alertness physically”.Days after the November order, there were instances of people at movie theatres being assaulted and arrested for not standing during the anthem. There have been instances of people beaten up for not standing up for the anthem and complaints have been lodged in several states across the country. Last October, award-winning writer Salil Chaturvedi – who suffers from spinal injury – was allegedly beaten up at a Panaji multiplex for not standing up while the national anthem was being played. The aftermath of this ugly, absurd incident is that Chaturvedi has not gone back to the movies. “I can’t go,” he says, “I’m afraid someone will hit me even harder, and worsen my spinal injury. I just don’t understand why it seems impossible for so many people to express patriotism in a non-aggressive manner.” On 16 Dec 2016, a case has been registered against seven people, including a woman, being beaten harshly fornot standing up for the national anthem in a cinema hall in Chennai. A group of students were allegedly manhandled after they refused to stand up when the national anthem was being played inside a movie theatre in Chennai’s Vadapalani on 11 Jan 2017. A 59-year-old man was allegedly assaulted in a movie theatre here for not standing up when the National Anthem tune was played on screen in a scene of the film ‘Dangal’, on 23rd Jan 2017.Section 3 of the Prevention of Insults to National Honour Act, 1971 states: “Whoever intentionally prevents the singing of the Indian National Anthem or causes disturbances to any assembly engaged in such singing shall be punished with imprisonment for a term, which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.” In the National Anthem Order, the Division Bench refers to Fundamental Duties as prescribed under Article 51A(a) of the Constitution. As per the said article, it is the constitutional duty of every Indian citizen “to abide by the Constitution and respect its ideals and institutions, the National Flag and the National Anthem”. It has been argued that: “Standing during the national anthem does not necessarily mean respect for the national anthem. Nor does sitting during the anthem mean disrespect or qualify as a crime. What qualifies as crime is a “willful act” committed to insult the National Anthem.”The National Anthem Order was a topic of debate as it has tried to introduce a new doctrine in Indian jurisprudence, i.e. Constitutional Patriotism. As per the order, the concept of protocol associated with the National Anthem has ‘its inherent roots in National identity, National integrity and Constitutional Patriotism’. By invoking a vague concept as “Constitutional Patriotism”, the Supreme Court was leading towards following the path of judicial inconsistency. The National Anthem order failed on the parameters on judicial ethics, judicial process and constitutional principles.We can also take the reference to what Dr. Ambedkar had said, while moving the Draft Constitution in the Assembly (Constitutional Assembly Debates: Official Reports Vol.VII: November 4, 1948, page 38):“While everybody recognized the necessity of diffusion of constitutional morality for the peaceful working of the democratic constitution…it is perfectly possible to pervert the Constitution, without changing its form by merely changing its form of administration and to make it inconsistent and opposed to the spirit of the Constitution.” It is therefore concluded that the National Anthem order by deviating from Constitutional Morality had gone against the spirit of the Constitution and in a way tends to pervert the Constitution, against which Dr. Ambedkar had warned.

VK Sasikala cannot contest elections for the next 6 years Even after Sasikala comes out after serving her four-year sentence, she would be disqualified to contest elections for the next six years as per the Supreme Court judgment in Lily Thomas versus Union of India of July 2013.The Court was delivering their verdict on appeals filed by Karnataka Government against the May 11, 2015 acquittal of then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa her then aide N Sasikala and two others in a 21-year-old disproportionate assets case by the Karnataka High Court.Conviction and Fine to the Accused The trial court had sentenced Sasikala, Ilavarasi and Sudhakaran under Section 109 IPC read with Section 13 (2) of the Prevention of Corruption Act — abetment of criminal misconduct of a public servant — to simple imprisonment for a period of four years each and pay a fine of Rs. 10 crore each. In case of default, they would have to further suffer imprisonment for another year. For the offence of criminal conspiracy leading to criminal misconduct of a public servant (Section 120 (B) IPC read with Section 13 (2)) of the Prevention of Corruption Act, all three were sentenced to simple imprisonment for six months and a fine of Rs. 10,000 each. Special Judge John Michael Cunha had ordered the attachment properties held by Indo-Doha Chemicals and Pharmaceuticals Pvt Ltd., Signora Enterprises Pvt. Ltd., Ramraj Agro Mills Ltd., Meadow Agro Farms, Riverway Agro Products.The prosecution had alleged that these companies were operating “for and on behalf of Ms. Jayalalithaa”. “In essence, these companies were used as receptacles of ill-gotten cash for which no explanation was given during investigation nor during the trial. Such cash becomes the basis for large scale property being purchased where all negotiations were done at the house of A-1 (Ms. Jayalalithaa),” senior advocate Sidharth Luthra, appearing for Karnataka had submitted.Grounds on which Karnataka government had challenged the Justice C.R. Kumaraswamy Judgment before the Supreme Court-Karnataka High Court judgment holds DVAC ignored 10 items of loans borrowed from nationalised banks valued at Rs. 24,17,31,274. Karnataka government exposes “mathematical error” in the HC judgment. Says totalling of all 10 loans comes to only Rs. 10.67 crore and not Rs. 24.17 crore.How Karnataka government calculates the percentage of disproportionate assets: The value of 16,32,36,812 (disproportionate assets) multiplied by 100, the value of which is divided by Rs.21,26,65,654 (total income) is equal to 76.7 percent.The petition filed by the Karnataka government argues that a CBI case on this issue is pending before the Supreme Court and the accused failed to bring this fact to the HC judge’s notice. Further, this petition contends that any gift received as a lawful source of income should be intimated to the authorities as per law Prevention of Corruption Act.The Karnataka high court on 11 May 2015 overruled the conviction, allowing Jayalalithaa to return as chief minister. The high court cited an error in computing the disproportionate assets and said they did not exceed the 10% of the stated income limit which warrants conviction.The bitter argument in the Court RoomThe SC bench had also asked Karnataka to prove that the source of money was Jayalalithaa and asked the prosecution to show evidence to the extent that the source of money was illegal. Karnataka had also requested confiscation of the immovable properties allegedly held by the four accused. In this regard, the trial court verdict had dealt with the assets of six companies allegedly attributed to the four accused.Luthra submitted that unexplained/unaccounted cash inflows started when the co-accused of Jayalalithaa took over as additional additional directors of the companies without buying any shares. In his reply, senior advocate Harin Raval for Jayalalithaa questioned Karnataka’s locus standi to file an appeal against the High Court judgment setting aside the attachment of the companies’ assets.Senior Advocate B.V. Acharya, who served as Special Public Prosecutor and Special Counsel in the disproportionate assets case involving former Chief Minister Jayalalithaa and AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala, said that this Supreme Court verdict is a message to those persons involved in corruption. Brief Timeline of the Disproportionate Assets Case By:Pareesh VirmaniValuation of buildings spread across 1,66,839.68 sq. feet: After PWD valuation and 20% deduction, Trial Court fixes total cost at Rs. 22,53,92,344. Karnataka High Court re-evaluates the cost of construction of the buildings and arrives at total cost of Rs. 5,10,54,060. Compares cost of construction of “posh and palatial multi-storied buildings” to construction of a PWD “shanty shed”. The total cost of Rs. 5.10 crore arrived at by the HC is even less than what the accused persons themselves admitted is the cost, Rs. 8,60,59,261.Marriage expenditure of co-accused and “foster son” V.N. Sudhakaran: Prosecution calculated expenses at Rs. 6,45,04,222; Trial Court arrives at sum of Rs. 3,00,00,000. Karnataka High Court reduces to “paltry sum” of Rs. 28.68 lakh solely on the basis of Ms. Jayalalithaa’s IT statement.Loans as income: Karnataka government says the ‘most serious and glaring infirmity’ in the judgment delivered by Justice C.R. Kumaraswamy is in the matter of considering loans as income. DVAC found value of loans borrowed by the accused is Rs. 5,99,85,274.DA is 76.7 pc of income and not 8.12 pc: Karnataka government’s calculations in the petition is Rs. 37,59,02,466 (total assets) subtracted by Rs. 21,26,65,654 (total income) is equal to Rs. 16,32,36,812.Income from grape garden: Prosecution computes total agricultural income from grape garden at Hyderabad as Rs. 5,78,340. Ms. Jayalalithaa computes income from the property as Rs. 52,50,000, The Trial Court computes the income as Rs. 10,00,000 and Karnataka HC judgment computes the income as Rs. 46,71,600Gifts as income: Karnataka HC treats gifts worth Rs. 1.5 crore received by Ms. Jayalalithaa on her 44th birthday as her “lawful income”.Income of SASI Enterprises: Trial Court rejected plea by accused that SASI Enterprises (a partnership firm between Ms. Jayalalithaa and A-2 N. Sasikala Natarjan) had a rental income of Rs. 12,60,800 and only Rs. 6,15,900 was taken into consideration by the prosecution. The Karnataka HC judgment arrives at an “abstract figure” of Rs. 25,00,000 on “guess work”, Karnataka petition contends.Income of Jaya Publications and “theory of Namadhu MGR”: When accused said total business income from Jaya Publications is Rs. 1.15 crore, the HC judgment raises it inexplicably to Rs. 4 crore by “erroneously treating the total amount of turnover as net profit”. HC judgment further rejects Trial Court conclusion that the evidence regarding Namadhu MGR scheme is “false” and “fabricated”.Income of Super Duper TV Pvt Ltd: A-3 and company proprietor, V.N. Sudhakaran, claimed the company made a “legitimate income” of Rs. 1.10 crore during the check period. Trial Court rejects the claim and the Karnataka HC sets aside the trial court finding, “unilaterally assesses” income as Rs. 1,00,00,000.Assets: Trial Court records 146 sales of immovable properties, making net worth from real estate sales to nearly Rs. 20 crore. Karnataka HC for no reason, ignores 49 of the 146 sales and reduces total value of sale proceeds to Rs. 6,24,09,120."

Here are some tips to keep you safe while you surf the internet. Here are 6 tips for the same: These are the basics to help you stay safe online. Stay safe stay happy. By:Harshdeep Grover Find and use a trusted piece or suite of antivirus software. Most viruses and malicious programs that can’t be dodged with the rest of the precautions below are relatively minor ones that can be dealt with by antivirus software. This is a program or set of programs that you can install on your computer to detect and outright block many viruses and other malicious programs that try to enter your computer from the Internet. Many of these programs also have measures for isolating viruses that do happen to make it onto your computer so that they can’t do damage, and then you can either delete them or find a way to fix the infected file(s) from there. Safely peruse.Beware of phony websites. These sites may have an address that’s very similar to a legitimate site, but the page can have misspellings, bad grammar or low resolution images. However, scammers are getting better at replicating sites so make sure. If a site asks for personal information, that you double check the URL and make sure it’s not asking for your personal information.If a website or email looks fishy, delete it or otherwise get away from it. We explained that certain types of Internet dangers — such as Trojan horses or phishing scams — are designed to trick victims into doing something dangerous that they otherwise wouldn’t. However, many of them aren’t all that clever or convincing, if you look closely at them. There are often dead giveaways that you can look for to know that you’re dealing with a phony website or email, such as advertising that seems too good to be true, numerous spelling and grammar mistakes, weird-looking or misspell email sender addresses or web addresses, or direct requests over email for personal information or money (most legitimate businesses will never do this).Control how much personal information you put on the Internet. Cyber-criminals can’t steal your identity or financial information over the Internet if you don’t put it there for them to find in the first place. Doubtless, though, there will be some websites where you are required to input personal information, such as if you are buying or selling things. Use the guidelines in tip #3 to only give your personal information to websites that can be trusted to keep it secure.Only make payments on trusted websites. If you’re going to use trusted e-commerce websites to buy goods and services, make sure to pay for your stuff through the specific website that you’re using at the time, if you can. This ensures that a trusted website has a record of your transaction, and can help you out if something goes wrong. Some third-party sellers attempt to have customers make payments for items outside of the websites that they sell them on. Not only do many e-commerce websites disallow this (because it cheats them out of commission fees), but even if a site does allow it, you probably shouldn’t go for it. It’s a very easy way to get scammed, since nobody with the proper authority will have a paper trail to help you track down and punish the scammer.Log out of websites and other Internet-based programs when you’re done using them. This is a really important precaution if you use public computers, but it’s not a bad idea in general. If you’re using a website where you have to log into a user account, be sure to log out of your account once you’re finished using the website. Also, disable any features of that website that allow you to stay logged in if you close your web browser or don’t do anything while logged in for a little while. Forgetting that you’re logged into a website or Internet-based program could mean that a stranger could sit down at the computer you were using, and find that they’re able to access your account without even cracking your user name or password. That’s a very easy way to have your confidential information stolen."

    "headline": "MARRIAGE IS A LICENSE TO RAPE IN INDIAA BLEAK REALITY WITH RAY OF HOPE: VICTIM COMPENSATION & REHABILITATION UNDER POSCO CYBER LAWS IN INDIA: EFFECTIVENESSCyber Security in India: All You Need to Know About It",
    "data": "Over the years, the patriarchy has dominated women in various ways not allowing them to exercise many rights, thus almost preventing them from having the most basic of human rights. This act of dominating women has taken a terrifying turn wherein certain rules laid down by the authoritative bodies prevent women from taking action against acts which sabotage their dignity and often leave a scar on their mental health for a prolonged period. Not being able to voice their situations has led to women coming from the weaker sections to submit to the acts against them. Despite several protests to withdraw rules that prevent women from seeking justice for acts that are unsympathetic towards them, no action by any of the authoritative bodies have taken place.One of the most controversial topics surrounding the denial of specific rights to women, rests in the decriminalization of marital rape in India. Marital rape is the act of the husband forcing his wife into having sex without their consent. Several arguments for the decriminalization of marital rape include the description of the Hindu Marriage Act which states that marriage is the union of one body and one soul, hence a husband forcing sex on his wife will not amount to marital rape. The question arises that- Does getting married give full right of the woman’s body to her husband? The answer is ‘NO’, under all circumstances as a woman being forced into sex is not providing consent, thus there arises the absence of free consent. Legislators have stated that if one has intercourse with their own wife, then whether the intercourse is consensual or not shall not be considered. Many attempts and protests have taken place in order to criminalize marital rape, but in vain. Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code states that if a girl who is not under 15 years of age is forced into intercourse with her husband, that shall not be considered as rape.Several stringent legislations are being passed pertaining to rape, especially after the Delhi gang rape issue, offering even death penalty to assaulters in extreme cases. However, no legislations offering a palliative to women, victims to marital rape have been passed yet. Marital rape is a common scenario in rural areas where marriage is considered a sacrament and women become ‘properties’ of their husbands after the marriage. The brides in the rural areas are mostly underage and too young to completely understand the notion of sex, thus getting forced into intercourse whilst fighting extreme discomfort and displeasure. Weddings in the rural areas, as well as in modern society take place between two individuals who have not been acquainted with each other before. In several cases the bride is unwilling to engage in sexual intercourse with her husband due to her personal discomfort, but her uneasiness is ignored and thus violated.After numerous requests for amendments and protests against this legislation, the question regarding the need for criminalization of marital rape still arises. Marital rape, not only violates a woman’s dignity, but mostly her mental and physical health for the rest of her life. A woman is subjected to violence where she is left with bruises all over her body, and in many cases it has been recorded that the sexual health of women is also affected which causes harm to the well-being of the woman for the rest of her life. Victims of marital rape end up suffering from severe depression, anxiety and constant fear regarding her peers around her.Marital rape, not being a crime, enables the assaulter to repeat their act thus violating the mental and physical health of an individual repeatedly. The victims not being able to report against the act are overshadowed by their assaulter, and have to come in terms with the terrifying fact that they have to spend the rest of their lives with an individual who went against their will and discomfort and scarred them for a lifetime. The victims not being able to attain the justice they deserve, are forced to suffer in their own silence.The topic of marital rape has sparked many protests to free the victims from households where they have been trapped for a prolonged period, and have been forced to succumb to their fate.Marital rape, in a layman’s language, is rape. Forcing an individual into intercourse, without their consent by a person, be it their husband to whom they are legally and ‘religiously’ bound to, or anyone else, is a violation of that individual’s basic human rights. Domestic violence is a crime in India and the assaulters are punished when reported against, and in the similar fashion, marital rape also includes the assault of an individual, and the assaulters must be punished. Marriage does not give a man the right to a woman’s body and the sexual abuse of married women by their own husbands cannot be ignored. Without a doubt, passing of strong legislative orders against such abuse is essential and the existing controversy surrounding marital rape can be brought to an immediate halt with the recognizing of marital rape under rape, and not as a license provided to the husbands to hamper the health the well-being of their wives. The authoritative bodies must recognize the pleas of victims and provide them with sufficient justice.By:Ratula DattaAmity Law School, Kolkatta"

    "data": "In decided case Union of India THR. THE SECRETARY, MINISTRY OF LAW AND JUSTICE vs. Subhash Chandra Agrawal, the Delhi High court has decided that Office of AGI does not fall under purview of public authority and thus declining permission to respondent seeking information regarding representation/ petition received from Indirect tax association, Bangalore.Respondent file an application for obtaining some information with regard to office of Attorney General of India (AGI) under section 18 of RTI act; his application had been rejected on the grounds that office of AGI does not fall under public authority as has been stated in Section 2(h) of the RTI act and there is no CPIO in AGI office. Subsequently respondent approached to Central Information Commission and his file was being rejected on same grounds.Then respondent hell bent on wish to approach to higher authorities and then approaches Delhi High Court for resolution. Justice Vibhu Bakhru, a learned justice, bawl out to authorities and set aside the said orders delivered by CIC on evident that AGI is being an authority under Article 76, Constitution of India falls within the definition of public authority under Section2 (h) of RTI act. And remanded them for reconsideration of writ petition.Against an order of learned justice, Central Govt. made an appeal to division bench of same high court. The Bench observed that the main function of AGI are to advise Govt. of India upon legal matters, to remain present before Hon’ble Supreme court or any high court on behalf on Govt. of India. Moreover, Supreme Court may take action against criminal contempt on a motion made by the AGI or AGI is an ex officio member of Bar council represent a small proportions of duties of an AGI. Essentially function of AGI is akin to an Advocate of Govt. of India, he is in a fiduciary relationship with the Govt. of India and cannot be put into public domain his opinion or material forwarded to him by Govt. Of India.Referring to Section 126 of the Evidence act which says that no barrister, attorney, pleader or vakeel shall at any time be permitted, unless with client’s express consent, to disclose any communication made to him.One of the objects of democracy is to bring about transparency of information to contain corruption and bring about accountability. But achieving this object does not mean that other equally important public interests including efficient functioning of the governments and public authorities, optimum use of limited fiscal resources, preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information, etc. are to be ignored or sacrificed. The object of RTI Act is to harmonize the conflicting public interests, that is, ensuring transparency to bring in accountability and containing corruption on the one hand, and at the same time ensure that the revelation of information, in actual practice, does not harm or adversely affect other public interests which include efficient functioning of the governments, optimum use of limited fiscal resources and preservation of confidentiality of sensitive information, on the other hand. While Sections 3 and 4 seek to achieve the first objective, Sections 8, 9, 10 and 11 seek to achieve the second objective referring to case Instituted of Chartered accountant of India vs. Shaunak H Satya & Ors.The bench decided “ looking at the object of the act, it appears to us that it would not have envisaged encompassing an office like that of an AGI to be covered under Section 2(h) of RTI act and held office of AGI not fall under public authority thus not under purview of RTI.

    "data": "The Madras High Court has issued notice to retired Supreme Court judge, Justice KS Radhakrishnan, in a petition of imploring that the former judge be coordinated to return the honor presented on him by People for Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA).The bench of Justice A Selvam and Justice P Kalaiyarasan also issued notice to Secretary- President of India, Ministry of Law and Justice and People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) Indiain a petition filed by one SalaiChakrapani.Justice Radhkrishnan was bestowed the ‘Man of the Year Award’ in 2015 for his contribution towards the protection of animals.Chakrapani’s contention is that Justice Radhakrishnan, who authored the judgment on banning of Jallikattu, should not have received an award from PETA, which is against Jallikattu. PETA was one of the parties to the case before the Supreme Court.Chakrapani has opposed that accommodating a honour from PETA was proof of predisposition with respect to the judge. The writ appeal to asserted that a former judge couldn’t get a honor – ‘Man of the Year’ – from an association, in whose support the judgment was conveyed.Chakrapani has also prayed that Justice Radhakrishnan be disqualified from being considered for sitting in the Supreme Court under Article 128.The petitioner also prayed for a direction declaring that the former judge was perpetually disqualified from enjoying post-retiral benefits and would not be reflected for obtaining the status under Article 128 of the Constitution. Article 128 empowers the Chief justice of India to consider a retired judge of Supreme Court or High Court to sit and act as judge of the Supreme Court.In 2014, PETA India had named Justice KS Radhakrishnan as “Man of the Year”. This was in gratitude of his judgment holding the traditional sport of Jallikattu to be in abuse of the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act. As a result, the use of bulls in the sport, as well as bullock cart races conducted in the states of Tamil Nadu and Maharashtra, were banned.The judgment had created a big public uproar in Tamil Nadu, leading to another round of litigation and an agitation in Chennai, eventually culminating in Tamil Nadu amending the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals Act to permit Jallikattu.It is, however, not clear how the Court can issue notice to the President’s office since Article 361 protects the President and Governors from being answerable to any court for any act done in their official capability. It states,“The President, or the Governor or Rajpramukh of a State, shall not be answerable to any court for the exercise and performance of the powers and duties of his office or for any act done or purporting to be done by him in the exercise and performance of those powers and duties…” By:Pareesh Virmani "

    "data": "The Delhi High Court appointed the former Supreme Court judge Justice Vikramajit Sen as the new administrator of Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA), reinstating the retired Justice Mukul Mudgal who did not wish to prolong the post. This step was intended for regulating the functioning of the state cricket body, which has tilted from one controversy to another in the recent past. Along with that several directions are issued by Justice S Ravindra Bhat and Justice Deepa Sharma, including amendment of Articles of Association of DDCA by incorporating clauses on capping age of members as well as on their tenure.Accounts of the years of 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-15 of Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) are being audited by an external auditor. “Justice Sen will also call for a meeting of DDCA members for reconstituting the cricketing body’s working and sports committees” said the judges. Thereafter, the administrator will meet the Registrar of Companies prior to holding of elections to elect the office bearers of DDCA: the bench added.The bench further concluded by saying that it is going to monitor the matter and the administrator can file periodic reports if required. The court had initially appointed Justice Mukul Mudgal, former Chief Justice of the Punjab and Haryana High Court, to oversee and streamline the holding of matches at the stadium.DDCA had opposed the plea appointment of any person or committee to oversee its affairs, saying it was a company and such administrators were appointed only for “sick” firms. It had contended that there was already a machinery in place under the Companies Act to supervise its functions and no administrator can be appointed.The High Court was forced to take action against the DDCA following several contentious issues relating to the functioning of the body and the problems which were arising with monotonous regularity over hosting cricket matches at the Ferozeshah Kotla stadium.

    "data": "Its really surprising to witness such harsh irrational platform that pronounces harsh punishment based on old aged customs even today in a biggest democratic country.We live in a country with a population of approx 1.21 billion ,but fail to eliminate such irrational institutions.There origin is lost in the mist of time .Many of us aren’t aware about the fact that they are social institution which have no sanctin under the law.These khap panchayat owe their existenece the states such as UP,Rajasthan and it is most active in the districts of Haryana.-The matter of concern here is that why this khap panchayat still continue to exists in our country?One of the biggest reason is that …25% of the population in Haryana are jats,that’s why the politicians support them.But can we overlook the overburdened judiciary system of our country ? Ofcourse not,so in some or the other way these khap panchayat reduce the burden of our judiciary system.Khap panchayat sort out a plethora of social and legal issues in villages starting from petty fisticuffs and minor disagreement to grazing land ,playground,water and fodder distribution in villages,land disputes,marital disputes,division of ancestral property and common resource management in villages and most noticeably social customs.But can these few steps of khap panchayat overlook the illegal dictates implemented in these many years .Here are some of the incidents that compel us to believe that we still live in the Barbaric era:In the same manner there are several more brutal incidents to describe .The government over the years have made reforms in this judicial body to put a control.It‟s been a high time to put a full stop on these prevailing malpractices and time demands, altogether, annihilate harsh and brutal practice of Khap and make the people aware about their rights because working of Khap in the name of honour and tradition is nothing but harm to basic human rights of individual. It is now essential for legislature to legislate on such a burning issue of Khap and also it requires from law enforcement bodies to prevent these derogatory practices. India being a member of the UDHR, the ICCPR and other international conventions, is also having a responsibility to initiate the mechanism which can curve up this problem. But only stringent legal measures will not be sufficient. This problem is the result of a centuries old society, having the feudal and patriarchal set-up, which can do anything for its culture and tradition. Here the need is not only to change the mindset of people today but also to step out of the old and outdated traditions so that these unauthorized actions can be prevented. With lacking of flexibility in approach the leaders of Khap may be found as uneducated senior persons of the Khap society. Through providing education to them and bringing awareness about present and prevailing law among them can make them working accordingly. Women participation is needed to encourage at the central level and a fair hearing of everyone before the final decision of the Khap Panchayat should be essential. This can immensely helpful in bringing social reforms in rural area. BY:SAURABH KUMARIn the Boling oil in a pot a coin is placed and the accused has to get it out of the pot of the boiling oil.

    "data": "Well, as portrayed in the movies or shows, the profession of lawyers seems to be so glamorous. The law is a great profession of people with good name, fame and power. What do you think is it so? However, according to me- The profession of law is a noble profession, which aims to provide justice to the victim and his family or the loving ones. A lawyer works in behalf of victims. So, what do I mean by lawyers? A lawyer is the person who represents his clients on legal matters in the court of law by advising, to seek justice for the unjust done. SOMEONE CONSISTENT IN HIS/HER WORK BUT RECEIVES LESS IN RETURN WHILE WORKING SOCIALLY FOR THE WELFARE OF SOCIETY IS A LAWYER. A lawyer is respected everywhere in the society, it is prestigious job, providing good name and fame as well better financial success. It grounds on providing justice by opposing the unjust and malpractices that are rooted deeply in the society.Have u ever wondered what are the qualities which differs lawyers from any other ordinary man? Which quality makes him so prestigious? ‘ARGUING’ is one of the essential factors for lawyers to win over the opponent. It is all about CONVINCING and PERSUADING your audience or judge, mediator or jury, through a logical, well-researched, well-reasoned discussion, based on the ground of all facts and the law. This profession also provides or guarantees thrilling, high-powered, highly reputated as well as a good life. It is intellectually challenging for this he should have high IQ, good in basic general knowledge and updated daily. Mainly this profession is not about pursuit of justice or right or wrong, at present it is all about reaching to a compromise between two parties. Today law became only a source of income. No one has anything to do to fight for the injustice done to the sufferers. Privately, lawyers aim to get money they have no soft-heartedness for the plight of the sufferers. They demand more money from the clients, who might not be financially strong. Somewhere lawyers at present are not exercising their duties well. All are currently having business mind, making this sacred profession a business with a tuff completion. Don’t u think?Our youths can easily understand that difference between right and wrong. They can pressurize the judicial system to take decisions in the welfare of society as done in case of ‘nirbhaya’ and the various petitions pleading government for online transactions. Law not only creates social awareness but helps to understand by analyzing ones nation in a different way. The perception of lawmen differs from laymen’s because of awareness of law, which outlines an original view and frames in our minds. Law helps to make things better. Hence, to do good and help others I had chosen law as my profession. Let’s start to change the negative pictures of lawyers at current and lets do something for the welfare of our people. Now let the real lawyers begin. BY:AKIKA SHARMAINDORE INSTITUTE OF LAW"

    "data": "According to some polls and studies Indian media topped in the list of most corrupt media in the world. Is the Indian media are corrupt?Morality of Today’s Indian MediaThe senior most journalists from old school of thoughts think present day media scene is corrupt to the core because it is owned by many rich and influential people with political connections and power. They can manipulate and manage any situation with the help of media. Be it political, commercial or social and economic situation, every issue can be managed by sponsored editorials and news. This is an unfolding story about the corrupt media that speaks volumes on the Editorial takes that we keep watching in TV debates and bias news bites. Investigative journalists and corrupt minds working in the media constantly keep claiming high moral positions; however that is simply a myth today. If not all, very few can claim to be clean, with high moral characters and true to their profession. Honesty and professional integrity are rare commodities in journalism today.Corruption in media is not new. But this has now become institutionalized. It started with Page 3 and parties, to private treaties and now at the next level it has gone to the political sphere with candidates paying newspapers and TV channels to put out news.It is a fraud that operates at three levels — the reader doesn’t know that what he is reading is paid for, the person paying is hiding this expense from the Election Commission, and the cash the media company is receiving is not disclosed in its balance sheet. There are documented allegations against Dainik Jagran, Dainik Bhaskar, Amar Ujala, Times of India, Hindustan, Eenadu, Sakshi, Lokmat and others. It also documents the claims and counter-claims made by representatives of the media.But there is no evidence…There is no clinching evidence because there is no transaction on paper. But there is a huge volume of circumstantial evidence. There are people on record saying that representatives of the Dainik Jagran, Dainik Bhaskar, Punjab Kesri, Eenadu asked for money.The only person who admitted that he paid — P Kodanda Rama Rao, a Loksatta party candidate from Andhra Pradesh — says he paid Rs 50,000 to Eenadu for favourable articles. The newspaper denied it. All of it follows a pattern. What are the future aspects?How can we take TV Channels at face value when they have debates which can be politically set, or orchestrated for political and monetary considerations? Today, the credibility of the media, journalists, Human rights Activists and political class has taken a beating and is at its lowest. And at the bottom of it is… Corruption at all levels. The responsible citizens of this country must make an educated choice and demand change in the corrupt system. Only civil society can do it if civil society wants to CHANGE INDIA FOR BETTER. The PCI (Press Council of India) has no power to penalize if more people become aware of this malpractice, if some of the names are shamed, then to some extent this short article would have achieved its purpose.

    "data": "How you would react if you get to know that the person who is fighting your case is not a lawyer but a scam artist, having a business card labelled him as a lawyer with a degree which he officially does not own. Fake degrees are not new in the market but with the help of e-commerce it is now more presumptuous than ever. Before if you want to be a lawyer you have to go to the law college and suffer some serious torture of books and exams (the basic starter kit of any law school), but now the time has been changed, now if you want to be lawyer you just have to find a good website or a scam artist to do your work, and tada, congratulations you’re a lawyer now. How easy is it? right? You just have to pay some cash and you can get your degree on your hands. The picture below is the example what exactly you going to get.“The level of legal profession has really gone down. Something needs to be done about the profession. It needs some oxygen to restore its pristine glory”. These are the words said by the Justice Kurien Joseph and requests bar council of India (BCI) to take actions ASAP.“At least 30% of all lawyers in India are fake”, fake lawyers are not only villein here but the former law minister itself having a fake degree, if the flame keeper itself is fake then what can we expect from others.Are there any steps taken till now? Yes, BCI council has started its first step towards goal, they have started verification process mandatory for all lawyers. The goal is big but can be winnable.My advise to the fake lawyers who are humiliating the profession, please do not fake around if you really want to a lawyer then go to a law school and get yourself an original degree or don’t practice the profession. Practicing without a degree is illegal, and those who does that will end up in jail. BY:HARSHDEEP GROVERINDORE INSTITUTE OF LAW"

An internship can be a really great opportunity to get a taste of the real world and help steer you in the right direction towards your career. As an intern, I’ve learned a lot of lessons that may be valuable for you also. These are some do’s and don’ts while on an intern.Do’s Don’ts Compiled byHarshdeep GroverIndore Institute of LawFirst of all do attempt to complete an internship during your college career, internships are to give you a better idea of what you might want to do as a career.Do ask tons of questions, going into your internship, you probably don’t have a lot of experience and that’s okay, that’s what internships are for. It’s important to ask tons of questions to get familiar with your work. You might make a few mistakes before you get the hang of things, so just remember to ask lots of question and even take some notes.Do be friendly and try to talk to everyone, as an intern it’s important that you’re friendly and try to get to know your co-workers. After all,networkingis one of the best parts of having an internship. Some great ways to get to know people is sitting with different groups at lunch. Take the time to network and make connections because you may find yourself using these contacts after your internship is over!Don’t be a know-it-all, as an intern, people already assume you’re there to learn from them. It’s important you don’t walk in and act like you know everything. Instead, take the time to learn from your co-workers and keep an open mind. The best way to make an impact is to listen to others and figure out what you can do to improve yourself.Don’t ever burn any bridges. Even if your intern experience isn’t what you hoped it to be, the contacts that you make may come in handy in the future.Don’t overstep any boundaries. Keep in mind that you are an intern and your ultimate goal is to learn and provide as much value as possible.Don’t forget to take every chance to shine and stand out.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on January 02, 2016, withdrew the BCCI President Anurag Thakur and Secretary Ajay Shirke for continued defiance regarding implementation of Lodha panel reforms. Anurag Thakur is in deeper trouble as the bench headed by Chief Justice T S Thakur has issued show cause notice which requires an explaination as to why perjury and contempt proceedings shall not be initiated against him for making false statements on oath before the court. According to this recent judgment, “BCCI President Anurag Thakur and Secretary Ajay Shirke shall forthwith cease and desist from any work of the BCCI”.The Bench has further directed that till administrators are appointed the senior most vice president will operate as President and Joint Secretary as Secretary. The court had also said it planned to “proceed to prosecute him” (Anurag Thakur) for perjury for making false statements before the court on oath and warned that “once it pronounces its order, the BCCI chief will have nowhere to go except jail”. Furthermore, the bench said, “This is frustrating. These were well meaning recommendations three judges of this court took pains involved all stake holders and you are trying to obstruct the reforms.CJI told Kapil Sibal, Anurag Thakur’s lawyer that the Lodha panel had told the court: “Supersede the present office-bearers of the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) with immediate effect and appoint in their place a panel of administrators headed by former Home Secretary G K Pillai to ensure the smooth transition from the old to the new system recommended by the committee”. During the hearing, Sibal said “What the Supreme Court is saying is law and is binding but I may still disagree. That liberty I must have, he said. To this, the bench shot back, The issue is that whether the BCCI is absolutely incapable of implementing the recommendations of the Lodha panel which the Supreme Court has accepted. How can a person continue when he is to be prosecuted for contempt or perjury or for obstructing implementation of the order. During the proceedings, Sibal, apologized to the court for marking an impression of misleading the court and has said that he would take instructions and file a list of names for the panel of observers. The bench has asked him to file the list within a week and said it would pass orders on whether to initiate contempt and perjury proceedings against Anurag Thakur.By:Paridhi Shivhare"

    "data": "A division bench of the Bombay High Court has held that the right of succession prevails over the rights of a nominee. The bench of Justices A.S. Oka and A.A. Sayed have held that the rights of the successors overrides that of the nominee of a holder of shares or securities appointed under Section 109A of Companies Act, 1953.The division bench was hearing appeals arising out of an order passed by a single bench. By an order dated March 31, 2015 a single judge of the Bombay High Court held that in the case of Harsha Nitin Kokate v. The Saraswat Cooperative Bank Limited(Kokate case) the view taken by Roshan Dalvi J was per incuriam or bad in law. These appeals were placed before the division bench after the Chief Justice passed an administrative order directing the same.During the citation of the Supreme Court’s decision in the case of Indrani Wahi v. Registrar of Co-op Societies and Others the bench analyzed that-“The conclusion drawn by the Apex Court was that a Cooperative Society is bound by the nomination made by the member. In case of such nomination, the Society has no option except to transfer the shares in the name of the nominee after the death of the member. However, those who are claiming inheritance will be entitled to pursue their remedies and claim title in the shares on the basis of inheritance. Thus, the conclusion drawn by the Apex Court was not that the nomination binds the legal representatives of the deceased shareholder or a member of the Society or that it overrides the law of succession.”In conclusion the bench observed-“The provisions relating to nominations under the various enactments have been consistently interpreted by the Apex Court by holding that the nominee does not get absolute title to the property subject matter of the nomination. The reason is by its very nature, when a share holder or a deposit holder or an insurance policy holder or a member of a Cooperative Society makes a nomination during his life time, he does not transfer his interest in favour of the nominee. It is always held that the nomination does not override the law in relation to testamentary or intestate succession. The provisions regarding nomination are made with a view to ensure that the estate or the rights of the deceased subject matter of the nomination are protected till the legal representatives of the deceased take appropriate steps.” “The provisions of the Companies Act including Sections 109A and 109B, in the light of the object of the said enactment, do not warrant any such departure. The so called vesting under Section 109A does not create a third mode of succession. It is not intended to create a third mode of succession. The Companies Act has nothing to do with the law of succession.”Megha KumariIndore Institute of Law"

    "data": "Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion, the bench remarked.The Supreme Court, in State of Himachal Pradesh v. Sanjay Kumar, has broach for a ‘survivor-centric approach’ towards victims of sexual violence, particularly children, keeping in view the devastating lifelong effects on such victims. This step has been taken to admonish the noteworthy reforms in the criminal justice system. While earmark the Himachal Pradesh High Court judgment a bench embrace Justice AK Sikri and Justice AM Sapre made this scrutiny which had exonerate a man arraign for raping his 9-year-old niece.Restoring the trial court verdict, the court sentenced accused for the rigorous imprisonment for 12 years and imposed a fine of ₹50,000 on him.‘Incestuous abuse is still regarded as a taboo’ While emancipating the accused the high court ,took note of the three-day delay in lodging of FIR after the girl informed the mother about the incident. The apex court bench observed that the accused being the uncle of the prosecutrix, it is not easy to lodge a complaint of this nature exposing prosecutrix to the risk of communal blemish, which unfortunately still overcome in our society.“A decision to lodge FIR becomes more difficult and hard when accused happens to be a family member. In fact, incestuous abuse is still regarded as a taboo to be discussed in public. This reticence hurts the victims or other family members who struggle to report. After all, in such a situation, not only the honour of the family is at stake, it may antagonize other relations as well, as in the first blush, such other members of family would not take charge of this nature very kindly,” the bench said. ‘Danger is more within than outside’In more than 80% of cases of such accuses the wrongdoer have acquaintance with the victims and are not strangers, the court observed that the danger is more within than outside. “Most of the time, acquaintance rapes, when the culprit is a family member, are not even reported for various reasons, not difficult to fathom. The strongest among those is the fear of attracting social stigma,” the bench observed.‘Survivor-centric approach’The court also observed that there is absence of victim protection mechanism with the whole process of criminal justice system extremely torment and therefore it is felicitous time to bring about considerable reforms in the criminal justice system as well. “Equally, there is also a dire need to have a survivor centric approach towards victims of sexual violence, particularly, the children, keeping in view the traumatic long lasting effects on such victims,” the court opined ‘Insisting corroboration insults womanhood’ The court also recapitulate that a rape victim evidence can be acted upon without endorsement as she is not an accomplice , and also as compared to an injured witness she stands on a higher pedestal. If the court finds it difficult to accept her version, it may seek corroboration from some evidence which lends assurance to her version. The court said insisting corroboration, except in the rarest of rare cases, is to equate one who is a victim of the lust of another with an accomplice to a crime and, thereby, insult womanhood.“It would be adding insult to injury to tell a woman that her claim of rape will not be believed unless it is corroborated in material particulars, as in the case of an accomplice to a crime. Why should the evidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or sexual molestation be viewed with the aid of spectacles fitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion? The plea about lack of corroboration has no substance,” the bench remarked observing that there was enough corroborative material in this case.By:Ritika SahiniIndore Institute of Law"

    "data": "The Kerala High Court on Friday observed that State intervention, by way of legislation, has become the first and foremost step to regulate triple is required in India. Justice A Muhammed Mustaq, while disposing a batch a petitions relating to Muslim divorce law, suggested a number of reforms which are required to be introduced in Muslim personal law. “The State is constitutionally bound and committed to respect the promise of dignity and equality before law and it cannot shirk its responsibility by remaining mute spectator of the malady suffered by Muslim women in the name of religion and their inexorable quest for justice broke all the covenants of the divine law they professed to denigrate the believer and faithful,” said the bench. The court opined about introducing Penal law for deliverance to sufferings of Muslim women in India who are victimized by the arbitrary talaq. The court held that entrustment to affect divorce through the court in no way would affect the practice of Sharia law in accordance with Qur’anic injunction. Justice Mustaq concluded that resistance is observed from a small section of Ulemas (scholars within the society) on the ground that Sharia is immutable and any interference would amount to violation of freedom of religion guaranteed under the constitution. “I find this dilemma of Ulema is on a conjecture of repugnancy of divine law and secular law. The State also appears as reluctant on an assumption that reforms of religious practice would offend religious freedom guaranteed under the Constitution of India,” he said. Does Personal Laws come under Article 13 and can state intervene to it?? The High Court said that the obvious reference usage under Article 13 indicates that constitution makers do not want to include personal law within the ambit of Article 13, as it is intimately connected with liberty to practice religion of one’s choice. But the court observed that the State can intervene in personal law to the permissible limit either by bringing legislation in tune with the religious precepts or doctrine or practices, or by making secular law not repugnant to the religious practices or beliefs of a particular group. “The empirical finding establishes that triple talaq as practiced in India in almost all the case is not by following Qur’anic injunctions and such practices are allowed in the name of religion, without its backing. It is not possible for the State to curb such practices by invoking penal law alone for the Muslims in India. The only way out for the State is to find out the meaning of rationale of the personal law and to regulate divorce in accordance with the purpose of law. This leads to the important question within the perspective of Islamic law as to the reforms in compliance with divine law as professed by Muslims.” Uniform civil code: An urgent need of society Drastic times calls for drastic measures. Implementing Uniform Civil Code is one such measure which is demandable in the society. Justice Mustaq observed that while emphasizing the need for national oneness in areas where it is possible and allowing citizen to have their own identity based on religious practices or belief, endeavour shall be made for common code of conduct to regulate behavior of subjects. The court was of the opinion that there are many areas where there can be Common Civil Code without there being conflict between the religious law and secular law and the marriage law is one example for codification of law. Finally, the court said it is for lawmakers to correlate law and social phenomena relating to divorce through the process of legislation to advance justice in institutionalized form.Megha Kumari Indore Institute of Law 1st Semester"

    "data": "Marital Rape is defined a non-consensual sex through force by the victim’s husband. It is aform of physical violence by the male partner of a married woman. It is not illegal within thelegal frameworks of India yet. Marital rape could be by the use of force only, a battering rape or a sadistic/obsessive rapeIn the present day, examines demonstrate that somewhere around 10 and 14% of wedded ladies are assaulted by their spouses: the occurrences of conjugal assault takes off to 1/third to ½ among clinical examples of battered ladies. Rape by one’s companion represents around 25% of assaults conferred. Women who got to be prime focuses for conjugal assault are the individuals who endeavor to escape. Criminal allegations of rape might be activated by different acts, which may incorporate genital contact with the mouth or butt or the inclusion of articles into the vagina or the rear-end, all without the assent of the casualty. It is a cognizant procedure of terrorizing and affirmation of the prevalence of Men over women Article 14 provides that “The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or theequal protection of the laws within the territory of India[1]”. Also, under Article 15, the state isempowered to make special provision for women and children in India[2]. According to these articles, it is clear that the state can take steps for criminalisation of marital rape and punishment to the wrongdoers..Section 375 in dealing with sexual assault, in a very narrow purview lays down that, an offence of rape within marital bonds stands only if the wife be less than 12 years of age, if she be between 12 to 16 years, an offence is committed, however, less serious, attracting milder punishment. Once, the age crosses 16, there is no legal protection accorded to the wife, in direct contravention of human rights regulations..Marital rape is illegal in 18 American States, 3 Australian States, New Zealand, Canada, Israel, France, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Soviet Union, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Rape in any form is an act of utter humiliation, degradation and violation rather than an outdated concept of penile/vaginal penetration. Restricting an understanding of rape reaffirms the view that rapists treat rape as sex and not violence and hence, condone such behaviour.Section 375- Rape – A man is said to commit “rape” who, except in the case hereinafter excepted, has sexual intercourse with a woman under circumstances falling under any of the six following descriptions[3]8:—Marriage does not thrive on sex and the fear of frivolous litigation should not stop protection from being offered to those caught in abusive traps, where they are denigrated to the status of chattel.

    "data": "Directive principles are guidelines or principles that form the basis of the center and state’s governance. They are to be kept in mind while framing laws and policies. The provisions with respect to the DPSPs are mentioned in Part IV of the Constitution (Article 36 – Article 51) and are also known as non-justifiable rights, meaning that they cannot be enforced by a court of law. However, they serve a unique purpose. They are aimed at facilitating and enabling the creation of such social and economic conditions, as will make leading a prosperous life more convenient for citizens. They aim to establish social and economic democracy through a welfare state. While the fundamental rights are a negative obligation on the government (meaning that the state must ensure they are not violated), the directive principles are a positive obligation of the government. The directive principles were adopted from the Irish Constitution.Article 37 of the Constitution of India states that the provisions contained in Part IV shall not be enforceable in any court. The logic behind this is that it would be very harsh on a government to expect it to realize every single one of the DPSPs. Say for example, if the government failed to, within its term, eradicate illiteracy completely, it would be held liable to pay compensation in the court, if the DPSPs were enforceable. Or it would be held liable for any inflation, terrorist attack or any significant issue that affects the general public at large. This would hinder the spirit of goodwill that forms an essential part of a country’s governance. Good intentions would be punished if it resulted in undesirable consequences and this was not what the framers of the Constitution wanted. Moreover, if laws were made to give effect to DPSPs over fundamental rights, it would be a violation of the fundamental rights and would thus be held constitutionally invalid. Nonetheless, in case of a conflict between fundamental rights and directive principles that benefit the interests of the society at large, the court is duty bound to uphold the directive principles over the former. Moreover, the judiciary is also duty bound to bear the directive principles in mind while deciding other cases.What the directive principles do though, is keeping a check on the ruling government. Though unenforceable, the DPSPs form a sort of parameter to analyze the effectiveness of the government. This helps during election to determine the government that would be in the best interests of the country. Due to this, the present government is always kept on its toes delivering what it has promised to the people. While many objectives of the DPSPs such as free legal aid and free education have been achieved to a major extent, other objectives have a long way to go yet due to various factors that are outside the control of the government.As our country climbs newer heights of development and our governments become more stable, self-sufficient and economically sound, there is hope that one day the directive principles will be made enforceable, as nothing is a better yardstick to measure the prosperity of the country and its people.

Utilizing a deterioration condition, we can clarify contrasts in expectations for everyday comforts as far as contrasts in attributes (qualities impact) and contrasts in the (coefficients impact).

It cleared out a profound effect; its lessons are in fact basic and might be taken as a helpful information when we examine the future Indo-Pakistan relations, or peace and security in South Asia:After all, the principle objective that was behind the Kargil Operation appears to be recognized that the best strategy might be that Indians go to the negotiating table to find a feasible solution to the problem, but actually it created more ambiguityIn a national security meeting with Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif at the Joint Headquarters, General Musharraf turned out to be intensely required with genuine contentions with Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Fasih Bokhari who at last required a court-military against General Musharraf. Benazir Bhutto, The Opposition pioneer in the Parliament and previous Prime Minister, called the Kargil War “Pakistan’s most prominent goof”. Numerous ex-authorities of the military and the Inter-Services Intelligence (Pakistan’s chief knowledge organization) also believed that “Kargil was an exercise in futility” and “couldn’t have brought about any preferred standpoint” on the bigger issue of Kashmir. A resigned Pakistan Army’s Lieutenant-General Ali Kuli Khan bludgeoned the war as “a fiasco greater than the East Pakistan disaster”, including that the arrangement was “defective as far as its origination, strategic arranging and execution” that finished in “yielding such a large number of troopers.” The Pakistani media scrutinized the entire arrangement and the inevitable climbdown from the Kargil statures since there were no increases to appear for the loss of lives and it just brought about universal judgment. By:Sewa Bishnoi Indians should not try to trifle with the wellness and proficiency of the Pakistan Army and must remember that they were found laying on the place where there is Kargil. Besides, Siachin as well, the Pakistan Army is giving an awesome record of itself.The best loss of the Kargil War, isolated from 1,200 lives lost on both sides of the LOC, was trust and sureness in Indo-Pak relations, which was at the season of three years on the most noteworthy purpose of inspiration."

    "headline": "Cong caught between Muslim votes and women’s rights over triple talaqIMPORTANCE OF MEDICLAIM POLICY  (In reference to Advocates)BREAKING: NEW ATTORNEY GENERAL OF INDIA APPOINTED: MAJOR SURPRISEThe Social Peril of Honour Killing",
    "data": "In India, there is a separate set of laws governing marriage, divorce and inheritance for each community and demand for their review has increased especially after some Muslim women challenged the practices of polygamy and triple talaq, which allows a man to divorce his wife by pronouncing the word talaq thrice, in the Supreme Court.In 1985, the Supreme Court directed Mohammad Ahmed Khan to pay a monthly maintenance of Rs 500 to 69-year-old Shah Bano whom he had divorced after 43 years of marriage to marry another woman. The verdict outraged a section of the Muslims who termed it “interference” in the Muslim personal law.The ghost of the Shah Bano case continues to haunt the Congress party that has been struggling to spell out its stand on the triple talaq issue. However, the Rajiv Gandhi government invalidated the Supreme Court verdict by passing the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986. It set aside the rights of divorced Muslim women to receive maintenance under Section 125 of the CrPC as per the Supreme Court judgement.The move was widely interpreted as an attempt to pacify the Muslims who had been the traditional voters of the Congress but it backfired as the party lost the 1989 Lok Sabha elections, plunging to 197 seats from 404 in 1984.The divorce practice, the Modi government has told the top court, violates the Constitution and is against gender justice and equality.The general refrain in the main opposition party is that the matter of triple talaq is sub-judice and the Supreme Court should be allowed to decide on the issue and Congress leaders usually avoid a direct reply to any controversial subject.On Friday, Congress spokesperson Shobha Oza maintained that her party was always in favour of empowering women but at the same time said that the apex court should be allowed to decide on the “tricky matter” of triple talaq.On another contentious issue of uniform civil code, the Congress is of the view that it should not be imposed without taking all the stakeholders into confidence. Under the uniform civil code, personal laws based on scriptures and customs of every religious community in India will be replaced with a common set of laws applicable equally to all citizens.

Whatever the outcome of the latest hearing, it could have political implications because it will determine whether seeking votes in the name of Hinduism or Hindutva is illegal.The SC said that “Hindutva/Hinduism is a way of life of the people in the subcontinent” and is a state of mind” – not a religion – and therefore seeking votes was not illegal under the Representation of the People Act, which outlaws poll campaigning on religious grounds.“Idol worship, rituals and ceremonials may not be practiced by a person although he may profess Hindu religion,” the apex court said. Even , “The word Hindu is not defined. A Hindu admittedly may or may not be a person professing Hindu religion or a believer in temple worship. A Hindu has the right to choose his own method of worship. He may or may not visit a temple. He may have a political compulsion for not openly proclaiming that he believes in temple worship,” said Justices H K Sema and S B Sinha, while upholding a Kerala High Court judgment that differentiated between a secular act and an act of religion.The term “Hindu” has been hotly debated for a long time, but a firm definition has proved to elusive. In an order sometime back, the Supreme Court had ruled “Hinduism is a way of life”. But, when Marxist ministers in Kerala were authorised under the law to appoint members to the managing committee of the Devasam temple, the decision was challenged. The petitioners argued since Communists are non-believers they cannot participate in the administration of a temple, even indirectly. It was argued that Communists are not qualified to run a temple, which are run by the statutory governing body under the Guruvayoor Devasam Act. Sakshi Dixit"

    "headline": "JUDICIAL ACTIVISM AND JUDICIAL RESTRAINNDA’s Presidential Candidate: Ram Nath Kovind a Dalit CrusaderDIGITALIZATION OF COURT PROCEEDINGS: – A NEW WAY TO INDIAN JUDICIARYEVOLUTION OF INDIAN LAW IN THE ERA OF DIGITALIZATION",
    "data": "The term “Judicial activism” refers to judicial rulings suspected of being based on personal or political considerations rather than on existing law. The actual connotation of the term ‘judicial activism’ is still a mystery. But it essentially implies an essential role that the judiciary plays in the promotion of justice. The Black’s Law Dictionary defines judicial activism as a “philosophy of judicial decision making whereby judges allow their personal views about public policy, among other factors, to guide their decisions.” It emphasises on the rights entrusted to the jurists to strike down any law or rule that goes against the spirit of the Constitution. In its positive sense it connotes a check on the tyranny of the Executive and as a ‘damage control’ tool when the Executive fails to recognize its duty properly and when intervention is essentially required.The origin and evolution of judicial activism can be studied under two theories i.e. “The theory of vacuum filling” and “The theory of social want”. Also, the concept of judicial activism has its roots in the English concepts of ‘equity’ and ‘natural rights’ and the first landmark case in this regard was the case of Marbury v. Madison[1]wherein for the first time, the judiciary took an active step and took steps above the legislative actions.‘Judicial Activism’ and ‘Judicial Restrain’ are the terms commonly used to describe the assertiveness of judicial power. These terms are often employed non-committally i.e. merely as descriptive short hand to identify some court or judges as more activist or more restrained than others. In this sense, the usage is neither commendatory nor condemnatory. The terms are used from the angle of the personal or professional view of the ‘right role’ of the Court. The framework of judicial activism is much wider in India because of the unique position given to the judiciary especially to the Supreme Court, under the Constitutional scheme. The Supreme Court is at once, the arbiter of federal principle, the guardian of fundamental rights of the citizens, final interpreter of the constitutional and other organic laws and last but not the least the final judge to determine the validity of even a constitutional amendment. Therefore in India, the judiciary, mainly the Supreme Court and the 24 High Court‘s have a greater scope to be active while discharging various judicial functions. Also, it is evidently opined that a responsible government is the hallmark of a successful democracy and constitutionalism, its collapse warrants many a drastic and unconventional steps and when the legislature fails to make the necessary legislation to suit the changing times and when the governmental agencies fail miserably to perform their administrative functions sincerely, it would lead to erosion in confidence in the constitution and democracy among the citizens. In such an extraordinary scenario the judiciary may legitimately step into the areas usually earmarked for the legislature and executive and the result is the judicial legislation and government by judiciary which essentially show the role “judicial activism” has to play. Interestingly, it is emphatically stated that there should exist a judicial enthusiasm to participate in bringing about a social reform and a change at large. The people involved in interpreting and applying a law which is not static but dynamic cannot sit as idle and silent spectators when the times go on changing and with the need of the hour the judiciary has encouraged social reformative changes and at times initiated Public Interest Litigation (PIL), also known as Social Action Litigation (SAL) in India. In such cases, the courts have discarded the traditional constraints on themselves such as the requirements of standing, ripeness of the case and adversarial forms of litigation and have assumed the functions of an investigator, counsellor, and monitor of administration.Additionally, the fundamental law of the land i.e. the Constitution of India, 1950 has designated the higher judiciary in India as the guardian of the fundamental rights of the citizens. A cumulative reading of Articles 13, 32 and 226 makes it very clear that the higher judiciary in India has been endowed with the onerous task of upholding the fundamental rights of the citizens. Under Article 13 of the Constitution any law which abridges fundamental rights shall be declared as void by the Supreme Court and the 18 High Courts. Under Article 32 of the Constitution, the Supreme Court has the power to issue any writ, order or direction to any person or authority violating the fundamental rights of citizens. In fact the right to approach the Supreme Court itself has been made a fundamental right on its own under Articles 32 to 35. Under Article 226 of the Constitution, the High Courts’ enjoy a power which is even more widely, to enforce the fundamental or other rights of the citizens, by invoking the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. All these powers vested in the Constitutional Courts, enable them to exercise vast powers of judicial review in respect of any legislative, quasi-legislative, executive, quasi-judicial or other actions of the State and its agencies. In fact this is the role which has been played by the Supreme Court and the High Courts’ effectively. The result often is the brooding omnipresence of judicial activism.It is thus clear that there has been instances of beneficial judicial activism to a great extent but it cannot be disputed that judicial activism has done a lot to ameliorate the conditions of the masses. It has evidently set right a number of wrongs committed by the States as well as the individuals. The greatest asset and the strongest weapon in the armoury of the judiciary is the confidence it commands and the faith it inspires in the minds of the people in its capacity to do even-handed justice and keep the scales in balance in any dispute.

    "data": "Before understanding the infringement of copyright we have to understand the meaning and scope of the copyright act, what does exactly copyright means and how it affects, according to the section 13 of the copyright act it says that all in ‘original’ literary, dramatic, artistic, musical works as well as cinematographic films and sound recordings. The plaintiff in any copyright infringement suit must first establish that his work is original if it is literary, dramatic, artistic or musical in nature. However, originality is a subjective factor and has not been defined anywhere within the act and cannot be contested easily in the court of law. There are two major concepts which they look into to check the originality of the work are ‘sweat of the brow’ and ‘minimum modicum of creativity’. The different infringement in India is compared basically through the comparison of the texts, in a holistic approach. Therefore they compare the work unlike in U.S.A they go into the in depth analysis into the problem of the infringement. The important international conventions which deal with the infringement is universal copyright convention, the Geneva and Rome Convention, Universal copyright convention.While finding out the infringement test the following things have to be tested, first we have to check that what kind of right is being targeted or infringed as mentioned under section 14 of the act it deals with the type of infringement, Generally speaking, this includes the right to reproduction, publication, translation and adaptation. In order to successfully prove a claim of infringement, the plaintiff has to establish that the defendant(s) has engaged in one of the acts that falls within the scope of exclusivity, now they test if the defendant has copied totally from the plaintiffs work then infringement of copyrights act has happened, when there is misappropriation, copying can therefore be proved by inference. The plaintiff has to prove basically that the defendant has totally copied the work and even the fact that the defendant cannot claim innocence through the fact that he did not know that the work had copyright, any particular form of resemblance would not mean that mean that the work has been infringed, there has to be a proper resemblance and the fact that the resemblance has to be complete and total. The plaintiff has to prove the fact with the evidences and in case evidences are absent he has to prove the substantial portion of the work has been copied and those part were of substantial importance. There are two types of infringement primary infringement and secondary infringement.Primary infringement deals with the real act of copying, while secondary infringement deals with other kinds of dealing like selling the pirated books, importing etc.Now after finding out if any important and substantial part has been under infringement there are the following remedies available which are civil, criminal and administrative, however it is the first two which is mostly put into use.The civil remedies put the interlocutory injunctions, pecuniary remedies involves under Indian law, however, there is a departure made and the plaintiff, under sections 55 and 58, can seek recovery of all three remedies, namely (a) account of profits (b) compensatory damages and (c) conversion damages which are assessed on the basis of value of the article converted.Criminal remedies for copyright violation include:Punishment through imprisonment which, under Indian law, may not be less than six months but which may extend to three years, fines which, under Indian law, shall not be less than Rs.50.000. and which may extend to Rs.200, 000.Search and seizure of the infringing goods including plates which are defined as including blocks, moulds, transfers, negatives, duplicating equipment or any other device used or intended to be used for printing or reproducing copies of the work.Returning of infringing copies or plates to the owner of the copyright.These days with the rise of patents and copyrights the violation of these rights are also on the rise. So the remedies available need to be applied properly so that people deter from doing such activities. By:Ankita Bakshi"

The government of India had introduced the corporate social responsibility in the year 2009. It says every company having a net worth of 500 crores or more or 1000 crores or more, to mandatorily have a corporate social responsibility committee, the company should have three directors out of which one should be an independent director. The CSR committee needs to formulate the policies on which the company is going to work. The committee shall also look into the implementation and monitoring of these policies. It will also be required to look into the amount of money or expenditure to be incurred and monitoring that and any money arising out of the CSR should be redirected to the CSR only and not used for any other purpose of the company.The company has to take into account the consideration the recommendations of the committee and should be used by the company. The committee shall formulate policy including activities specified like the eradicating hunger/ poverty, malnutrition , promoting and preventing health care, it also includes promoting education , promoting gender equality, ensuring environmental sustainability, protection of national heritage, measures for the benefit of the armed forces , training to promote rural sports , nationally recognized sports , rural development projects.

Projects or programs relating to activities specified in the Schedule; or Projects or programs relating to activities undertaken by the Board, in pursuance of recommendations of the CSR Committee as per the declared CSR policy where the policy covers subjects enumerated in the Schedule. The fundamentals of CSR rest on the fact that not only public policy but even corporate should be responsible enough to address social issues. Much has been done in recent years to make Indian Entrepreneurs aware of social responsibility as an important segment of their business activity but CSR in India has yet to receive widespread recognition.SEBI has mandated the inclusion of Business Responsibility Reports as part of the annual reports of the Top 100 listed entities based on market capitalization at BSE and NSE. It is mandatory to make these reports available on the website of the company. CSR will help companies to devise strategies to leverage their core competencies in delivering better economic, environment and social value to their stakeholders. The CSR rules apply to the subsidiary as well as the foreign companies. Generally the areas taken for the functioning of the CSR activities are local areas and areas around which the company operates. Along with the annual report the Board of directors are asked to present the CSR with it and it should be presented in the manner prescribed in the manual. Where the website of the company is available the CSR report is to be published on the website mandatorily. The rules are applicable to both private and public firm."

    "data": "Do you believe in justice? That our common freedoms ought to be secured? That all nationals would it be advisable for all to be dealt with as equivalents? You would most likely reply, “obviously!” But do you additionally understand that in the event that you are an eager supporter of open qualities like “equity,” “freedom” and “balance,” then you ought to likewise be a devoted supporter of government? Government is regularly the main foundation that can make these sorts of center political qualities a reality. Truth be told, without a dynamic and solid open division, these sorts of open qualities would be hard to come by. Take equity, for occasion. It is not as a rule something gave by the commercial center or made by the activities of people. All the more regularly it is something that must be given and maintained in general society circle by the activities of government associations like the courts and the lawmaking bodies. On the off chance that we need a fair society, we should work through government to get it. They are receiving financial support of taxpayer money. Private sector workers are putting money in public sector worker’s pockets. Generally speaking, since their total compensation is relied upon tax revenue then they should not counted as real or true taxpayers. The government employee’s checks do not contribute any net value to the economy.As far as paying taxes, government employees can be seen as identical to any other citizen. They are subject to taxes on their paycheck and are subject to taxes and fines as appropriate to their financial situation they find themselves. Just because they work for the government does not mean they do not pay taxes.Life isn’t reasonable” is a most loved saying among traditionalists. What’s more, the regularly implicit conclusion is, “So get accustomed to it.” But a great many people would prefer not to get accustomed to it. Actually, the craving for reasonableness is as American as crusty fruit-filled treat – it is in our blood. We get aggravated up when individuals are not treated reasonably and we think something ought to be done about it. Also, as a general rule the spot that individuals swing to attempt to right these wrongs – to make life more pleasant for themselves as well as other people – is government. Government is the principle supplier of equity and decency in American culture. Numerous administration strategies and government foundations are unequivocally intended to advance these critical open qualities. It is uncovering that even libertarians and other against government ideologues concede that the criminal and common equity frameworks are parts of government that are totally essential and is impossible away with. They contend that running the police, the courts, and detainment facilities are true blue open attempts that must be kept up even in a negligible rendition of government. Be that as it may, there is not really anything “negligible” about the degree and expenses of this equity framework. It is not really “little” government by any means. The caseloads in our courts are tremendous. More than 338,000 common and criminal case filings were made in government region courts in 2008. State courts took care of about 28 times the same number of common cases and 82 times the same number of criminal cases as did the government framework – with their case filings totaling more than 12 million.1 obviously by far most of these cases were settled and did not come to trial, but rather these numbers give us a smart thought of the tremendous workload being put on our court framework. The legitimate equity framework is additionally barely “negligible” in the event that we take a gander at what number of individuals it utilizes and how much cash it cost the taxpayers. In 2006, 2.4 million individuals were utilized in the equity frameworks directed at the government, state, area, and city level. These incorporate the police, prosecutors, judges and other staff in the legal framework, and those working in adjustments offices. What’s more, 2006, the country spent an aggregate of $214 billion on criminal and common equity services.2 to put it plainly, government tries to build up and keep up a criminal and common equity framework are neither basic nor modest, they are enormous and extremely costly. They require a sound and sufficiently supported government. By:Sewa Bishnoi"

    "headline": "Should We Continue With The Collegium System?PHOTO MORPHING: DECONSTRUCTION SECURITY OF AN INDIVIDUAL IN THE CYBERSPACE﻿CORONA: ATTACKED HUMANISM AND RAISED AN AMENDMENT TO PROTECT HUMANISMDoes Zoom Video Conferencing App Violate Right to Privacy?",
    "data": "Appointment of judges has been made by the collegium system for around two decades now. It involves the appointment and transfer of judges on the recommendation of the Chief Justice of India (CJI) and four of the Supreme Court’s senior-most judges. This system is not laid down by the Constitution, but has rather evolved as a result of the judgement given in the Three Judges Cases on the 28th of October, 1998. The collegium system has been criticized many times on a number of grounds:(i) It has created an ‘Imperium in Imperio’, meaning that the collegium system has aided in the formation of an empire within an empire of judges.(ii) It has earned a reputation for encouraging a ‘give and take’ policy in the legal system by enabling chances of favouritism to creep in.(iii) It differs from the procedure for appointing judges mentioned under Article 124 of the Constitution: “Every judge of the Supreme Court shall be appointed by the President by warrant under his hand and seal after consultation with such of the judges of the Supreme Court and the High Courts in the states as the President may deem necessary for the purpose and shall hold office until he attains the age of 65 years; provided that in the case of appointment of a judge other than the Chief Justice, the Chief Justice of India shall always be consulted.” But the collegium system, as much as it may appear so, is not all bad. It has been considered a well-placed system due to the following factors:(i) It upholds the principles of separation of powers and facilitates independence of the judiciary – The Legislative and the Executive do not interfere in the process of appointment and transfer of judges.(ii) It makes the judiciary independent of politics. And outside influences as well.(iii) It upholds the seniority of the candidates and relies upon the best judgement of the judges. To curb the collegium system and bring a more democratic system of appointing judges in its place, the National Democratic Alliance government passed the National Judicial Appointments Commission (NJAC) bill. The NJAC was proposed to be a body consisting six members – the CJI, two of SC’s senior-most judges, the union minister of law and justice, two eminent persons (one of whom had to belong to the Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, Other Backward Classes, other minority groups or women) appointed by the CJI or the Prime Minister or the leader of the opposition in Lok Sabha. The secretary of NJAC was proposed to be with the law ministry. The NJAC has three members from the judiciary and three members from outside. Moreover, members have a veto power, which means that every one of them can significantly influence the decisions of the NJAC. Once a particular recommendation is vetoed by a minimum of two persons, it cannot be revived. This is precisely the reason why the Supreme Court struck down the NJAC Act and declared the 99th amendment that aimed to overthrow the collegium system as unconstitutional, saying that it would dilute the independence of the judiciary. Therefore, after analysing the pros and cons of both the systems, it is plainly obvious to the common observer that neither of them are fully equipped to guarantee a transparent and impartial system of appointing and transferring judges. In its place, the government should constitute an independent body dedicated to appointments of the judiciary, much like the Election Commission of India. This body must be empowered to work in a methodical manner of evaluating and selecting eligible nominees. The proposal for the same was made by Prashant Bhushan and the Centre for Public Interest Litigation in their petition. Such a body, in my opinion, would be just the thing we all need to restore our faith in the appointment of the worthiest verdict-givers in the country."

    "data": "Balochistan is a region is south-west Pakistan. Though rich in natural resources like Natural Gas, Oil, Coal, Copper, Sulphur, Fluoride and Gold, it is the most under-developed and poor region in Pakistan. According to the separatists of Baloch, the government of Pakistan is systematically suppressing development in this region to keep the Balochs weak. The government of Pakistan has also been accused of human rights abuses and deteriorating law and order, resulting in the people of Baloch being reduced to a minority status in their very own state. The nationalists of Baloch have staged many insurgencies in the past with an aim of gaining greater autonomy, increased royalty for their natural resources and provincial revenue and an independent nation-state.There have been five major conflicts starting from as early as the British Raj. Amongst them the fifth conflict has been continuing for more than a decade, from 2004 to the present day. According to an exiled, US based Baloch journalist, ‘the ongoing resistance is Baloch has created serious challenges for the Pakistan government, unlike the past resistance movements because this one has lasted longer than the previous insurgencies, has greater breadth (including the entire province from the rural mountainous regions to the city centres), involves Baloch women and children at regular protest rallies and has drawn more international attention (including a 2012 hearing by the US Congress).’ However, infighting amongst groups in the Baloch insurgency has weakened the movement since late 2014.What is India’s role in the Baloch insurgency?Pakistan has, since long, insisted that India is behind Baloch insurgency and continues to repeatedly support the Baloch rebels. In fact, it is convinced that no evidence is required to prove the alleged support. In 2016, Pakistan claimed that it caught an Indian Naval Officer who was tasked by the RAW (Research and Analysis Wing) to carry out terrorism in Balochistan. It has also been reported that western observers believe that India secretly funds the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA). India, on the other hand, has repeatedly denied these claims, stressing at Pakistan’s lack of ability to provide any evidence. A Baloch activist is reported to have laughed and said, in a 2008 interview, that their conditions would not have been so miserable, had they enjoyed support from India, when asked about the alleged link of his group with India. In his 2016 Independence Day speech, India’s Prime Minister Narendra Modi criticized Pakistan and human rights issues in Balochistan. While Pakistan condemned Modi’s remarks and called it an attempt to create a diversion from the violence in Kashmir, exiled Baloch separatist leaders welcomed it.Human Rights issues in Balochistan – What is the judiciary doing?With more than 5000 forced disappearances from Balochistan and many innocent inhabitants stuck in Pakistan’s slow legal relief system, waiting to be heard on a variety of matters ranging from robbery to gun smuggling, the Supreme Court of Pakistan was forced to take initiative and ask around about the situation in depth. According to its findings, it said that the situation was going out of control.The Supreme Court is currently investigating the ‘missing persons’ and has issued an arrest warrant for Military Dictator Pervez Musharaff. The Chief Justice of the Supreme Court also said that the military must act under the government’s direction and follow well-defined parameters set by the Constitution.The Supreme Court, headed by Justice Iqbal, has also ordered the government to grant subsistence allowance to the families affected by these missing persons. The Justice has advices the families against losing faith. He said that the situation of missing persons is becoming an epidemic problem.A Commission of Inquiry on Enforced Disappearances has been constituted on the orders of the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court is vying to make it a permanent body. By:Ananya PatilSharda UniversityPakistan has been accused of engaging in systematic repression and marginalization of Balochs. Islamabad has reportedly detained thousands of Balochs nationalists, denied Balochs positions in governmental institutions and the military, assassinated Baloch leaders and funded religious schools to aid religious radicalization.The Pakistan government has been accused of imposing extraordinary restrictions on the freedom of press in Balochistan. It has also prevented international media from reporting from conflict zones. Foreign journalists have also been physically assaulted by intelligence agents.It is reported that the human rights violation in Balochistan has reached a whole new level of ‘genocide’. The Pakistan Army is said to have killed Balochs indiscriminately, abducted women and taken them to rape cells and torture cells.It is also alleged that Pakistan has created a local Al-Qaisa and ISIS group in the region. It also smuggles Balochistan’s energy resources away from the rightful beneficiaries."

Chandrachud, came out strongly in favour of a uniform civil code, observing that, “A common civil code will help the cause of national integration by removing disparate loyalties to law which have conflicting ideologies.” A national furor erupted in the wake of this decision, prompting the incumbent Rajiv Gandhi government to overturn the decision by enacting the Muslim Women (Protection on Divorce) Act, 1985, which effectively barred Muslim women from claiming maintenance under Section 125. This move contradicted the observations of the Supreme Court and was justified on the grounds that mere observations of the Court did not obligate the other branches of government to actually implement such a uniform code. In Sarla Mudgal vs. Union of India(v) , the Supreme Court revisited the matter. The issue in question was whether a Hindu man who embraced Islam could solemnize a second marriage as a Muslim. The Court held that in such a case, the first marriage would have to be dissolved under the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. A simple conversion to Islam followed by marrying again would not amount to such dissolution. The man’s first marriage would therefore, still be valid and under Hindu law, his second marriage, solemnized after his conversion, would be illegal under Section 494 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Justice Kuldip Singh, delivering the judgment, remarked sharply that “the Rulers of the day are not in a mood to retrieve Article 44 from the cold storage where it is lying since 1949. The Governments – which have come and gone – have so far failed to make any effort towards “unified personal law for all Indians”. He went on to note that, “When more than 80% of the citizens have already been brought under the codified personal law there is no justification whatsoever to keep in abeyance, any more, the introduction of “uniform civil code” for all citizens in the territory of India.” End Notes:[i] AIR 1964 SC1793[ii] AIR 1982 SC686[iii] AIR 1996 SC 1697[iv] AIR 1985 SC 945[v] AIR 1995 SC 1531 BY:Sewa BishnoiSLS, Hyderabad"

    "headline": "Prisoner’s Rights and Healthcare in IndiaNO MORE CHEATING ON AN E-COMMERCE PLATFORM – IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?ANALYSIS OF CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT 2019LAW OF GUARDIANSHIP IN INDIA AS PER DIFFERENT RELIGIONS",
    "data": "Before understanding the rights of the prisoners we need to understand the term Human Rights. Human Rights are those rights which are entitled to human beings by the virtue of being humans, given by the state or any public authority. Every human being are entitled to human rights even the prisoners, since after commission of a crime they don’t cease to be humans and is entitled to the basic human dignity. However we should understand who are exactly prisoners? Before understanding their rights. Prisoners includes those people who by the restrictions imposed by the court or otherwise detained by legal custody. This includes confinement, captivity or by forcible restraint. Thus barring the punishment they should be entitled to the human rights which is entitled to them. Likewise it includes right to food and water, right to reasonable wages by the prisoners otherwise the work which they are doing will be considered as forced labor, right to have a lawyer and free legal aid, right against bullying and torture, right to have a speedy and fair trial. The legislation which dealt with rights of the prisoner were basically prisoners act 1894, Prisoners act 1900, Prisoners Act 1955, Model Manual Prison India and later emerged the constitution of India which included the rights which were implied in nature and the judgments were also a source for establishing their rights.Before discussing the different articles, which gives rights to prisoners / other citizens which should know that the rights under constitution are not absolute but conditional. Under the Indian Constitution the articles which entitle the rights of the prisoners are Article 21- this article guarantees right to life and liberty this right extends up to nationals and foreigners thus we see that the prisoners shouldn’t be deprived by life and liberty until it is mentioned so by the court as his/her punishment. Article 20(1) protects the person from being given any harsh punishment if it has not been prescribed during the time of punishment. The next article which deals with the 20(2) says that no one should be punished for the same offense twice. Article 19 even allows the prisoners to form association with inmates peacefully. Article 22(4) to (7) are also very important and gives the right of the detenue article 22(4) basically says that the period for which a person can be detained is basically 2 months and not more than that, another is 22(5) which gives the rights of the detenues. Judgments include the case of DK Basu v State of West Bengal, shows how custodial death is one of the important problems faced by prisoners in India even custodial violence was dealt in this case; thus this case stood as a landmark judgment and the conditions for arrest were clearly elaborated which needed to be followed. Thus judiciary has played an important role through different judgments in maintaining the rights of the prisoners. Mahammad Giasuddin v. State of A.P. in this case the judgment basically deals with the payment of wages to the prisoners for their work or hard labor. Prem Shanker Shukla v. Delhi Administration, in this case the court basically deals with handcuffing shouldn’t be done unless it has been warranted. Francies Corale Mullin vs. the Administrator, Union Territory of Delhi & others this basically deals with personal liberty and right to meet lawyer in presence of an officer and right to meet relatives.However the lack of proper legislation; have been one of the factors which has hindered the healthcare and rights of the prisoners. Other than the rights the healthcare aspect is one which should be looked into, prisoners are exposed to various forms of health care issues like which included high amount of mental disorder like stress and depression, respiratory disorder, there is also other contagious diseases, there are problems of drug abuse, alcoholism, trauma, homicide, suicide, violence, neuropsychiatric diseases, epilepsy, stress manifestations, HIV infection and AIDS, sexually transmitted diseases, tuberculosis, skin infections, and so on which is mainly the outcome of the conditions which are present within the prison which has to be changed in order to improve their health conditions. As the number of deaths due to the bad living conditions within the prison increasing there is a dire need within the developing countries to improve the conditions of the prisons. These overcrowded prisons, firstly needs to increase in size, so that the level of accommodation increases too. Even it needs to have a higher level of sanitation and hygiene. The use of drugs has to be curbed. They should also have a regular check up of these prisoners not only physical check up but their mental state should be tested as well.BY:Ankita Bakshi "

However, States located in difficult terrain have been given a relaxation of 72 hours for the same, due to poor internet connectivity. A bench comprising Justices Dipak Misra and C Nagappan, has furthermore recorded cases relating to terrorism, insurgency and sexual offences as exceptions to this directive and have therefore, provided such cases an exemption from being uploaded. With initially the time period being suggested as 48 hours during the hearing, the bench later fixed the time limit as 24 hours and has also clearly stated that the accused cannot take benefit before the courts of law of the fact that FIRs lodged against them have not been uploaded on the website.

    "data": "The Supreme Court on Tuesday rejected the plea of Ashiq Hussain Faktoo, Kashmir’s longest serving prisoner to reconsider his conviction. Faktoo is a Kashmiri separatist leader and a former member of terror outfit Hizbul Mujahideen and has been awarded life imprisonment for killing human rights activist H N Wanchoo. Despite the fact that Faktoo had denied the charges that were forced on him and said that he was he was being focused on in view of his political convictions, the court still sentenced him to life detainment. In prison, he completed his doctorate in Islamic studies. More than 125 students have completed their bachelors’ preparatory program, graduation, post graduation under his guidance. He is married to an equally prominent separatist activist and Dukhtaraan-e-Millat (DM) chief, Syeda Asiya Andrabi. Faktoo has the distinction of being the only Kashmiri militant to have completed his PhD while detention. He was awarded a Doctorate of Philosophy by the Department of Islamic Studies of the University of Kashmir. Faktoo has been in the Srinagar Jail since 1993 and has served his sentence for over 20 years. The Jammu court had absolved him in 2001, yet the Supreme Court toppled this decision and held him blameworthy. After that as well, he persuaded the Supreme Court to re examine his conviction and life detainment. The court turned down his petition straightaway saying that SC judgment could not be challenged by a writ petition. The bench then converted the writ petition to a review petition, which was heard in the open court. A three-judge bench, headed by Justice Ranjan Gogoi, which treated the writ petition of Faktoo as a review plea, said the “comprehension” of the accused that the earlier judgement was “erroneous” would not enable the court to “reopen” the entire case."

    "data": "The Apex Court on Monday has directed the syndicate of banks led by the SBI to answer to a much bugged liquor tycoon Vijay Mallya’s plea seeking recall of the notice of contempt for allegedly not making full disclosure of all the assets owned by him and his family as directed by the top court earlier. The bench of Justice Kurian Joseph and Justice Rohinton Fali Nariman has given 10 days time to the State Bank of India (SBI) and to the liquor baron, Mallya, a week’s time to file his rejoinder on September 27 at the time of the hearing of the matter. Contending for Mallya, advocate Mahesh Agarwal said that the disclosure of the assets was for the settlement of outstanding dues with the banks, and since no settlement was taking place, he was not obliged to make disclosure and consequently there was no contempt. Where on the other side, sticking to his contention, Attorney General, alleged Mallya of not yet disclosing about $40 million which he acquired from British spirits maker Diageo as a part of severance package. The consortium has therefore moved to the top court seeking the settlement of his outstanding dues amounting to more than Rs 9,000 crore. Rohatgi also told the court that Mallya’s plea for the recall of contempt notice could not be entertained, since neither he has entered appearance nor he has moved an application for exemption from appearance.
