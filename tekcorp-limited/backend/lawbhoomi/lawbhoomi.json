The first rule of the learning-from-mistakes handbook is to own up to them.Resist the urge to hide or shift blame; instead, embrace honesty. Confess your error to your supervisor, because, in the world of internships, transparency is the key that unlocks the door to growth.Understanding What Went WrongNow that you’ve admitted your mistake, it’s time to play detective and get the learning from internship mistake. What led to the blunder? Was it a miscommunication, lack of attention or an unfamiliarity with the task at hand? Understanding the root cause is essential.Take a moment to reflect on the sequence of events, the decisions made and the factors contributing to the mistake. This reflective process is the foundation upon which your future success can be built.Developing a Plan for the FutureAcknowledging your mistake is the first step; the next is developing a concrete plan to avoid a repeat performance. If the error occurred in a project, seek feedback from your supervisor on how to enhance your work.If deadlines are slipping through the cracks, formulate a strategy to ensure timely submissions in the future. This might involve refining your time management skills, seeking clarification in advance or setting more realistic goals. The goal is not just to fix the mistake but to grow from it.Using Mistakes as MotivationMistakes are not roadblocks; they’re opportunities for growth.

Apologise, explain the situation to your supervisor and then strategise. Perhaps it’s time to revamp your time management skills or communicate more effectively with your team. The key is not to repeat the same mistake twice.The Verbal SlipWe’ve all experienced it – saying something in a meeting that we wish we could take back. Apologise, clarify your intentions and use this as a moment of self-reflection. Why did it happen? What can you do to communicate more effectively in the future?Your Supervisor: Your Guide in the Internship Jungle:It’s crucial to recognise that your supervisor is not the intimidating figure waiting to scold you for every misstep.

Remember, the most successful people aren’t those who never failed, but those who turned their failures into lessons.So, as you navigate the twists and turns of your internship journey, let each mistake be a lantern lighting your path to growth and success.

    "headline": "Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005",
    "data": "                      Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 plays a crucial role in safeguarding the rights and well-being of aggrieved individuals. Domestic violence is a pervasive issue that affects individuals across the globe, cutting across age, gender and socioeconomic lines. In recognition of the need to address this serious concern, The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 was enacted in India. This article delves into the intricacies of Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005, exploring its provisions and the protective measures it affords to those who have experienced or are at risk of domestic violence.Understanding Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 empowers Magistrates to issue protection orders after assessing that domestic violence has occurred or is likely to occur. These orders are comprehensive and multifaceted, aiming to shield the aggrieved person from further harm and harassment. Let’s examine each facet of the protection orders outlined in Section 18 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005.Section 18 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 has been extracted here for ease of reference:“Section 18 in The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 200518. Protection orders.—The Magistrate may, after giving the aggrieved person and the respondent an opportunity of being heard and on being prima facie satisfied that domestic violence has taken place or is likely to take place, pass a protection order in favour of the aggrieved person and prohibit the respondent from—(a) committing any act of domestic violence;(b) aiding or abetting in the commission of acts of domestic violence;(c) entering the place of employment of the aggrieved person or, if the person aggrieved is a child, its school or any other place frequented by the aggrieved person;(d) attempting to communicate in any form, whatsoever, with the aggrieved person, including personal, oral or written or electronic or telephonic contact;(e) alienating any assets, operating bank lockers or bank accounts used or held or enjoyed by both the parties, jointly by the aggrieved person and the respondent or singly by the respondent, including her stridhan or any other property held either jointly by the parties or separately by them without the leave of the Magistrate;(f) causing violence to the dependants, other relatives or any person who give the aggrieved person assistance from domestic violence;(g) committing any other act as specified in the protection order.”Prohibition of Committing Acts of Domestic ViolenceThe foremost aspect of the protection order is the prohibition of the respondent from committing any act of domestic violence. This broad prohibition serves as a preventive measure, aiming to break the cycle of abuse and create a safer environment for the survivor.Prohibition of Aiding or AbettingSection 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 recognises the importance of holding not only the primary perpetrator but also those who aid or abet in domestic violence accountable. By prohibiting any involvement in the commission of such acts, the law seeks to discourage collaboration in the perpetration of violence.Restrictions on Entering Specific Places under Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005To ensure the safety of the aggrieved person, the Magistrate can impose restrictions on the respondent’s entry into specific places. This includes the workplace of the aggrieved person and, if applicable, the school or other frequented locations if the aggrieved person is a child. These restrictions aim to create safe spaces for the survivor, free from the threat of encountering the perpetrator.Restrictions on CommunicationEffective communication restrictions are crucial in preventing further emotional distress and potential harm. Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 prohibits the respondent from attempting to communicate with the aggrieved person through various means, including personal, oral, written, electronic, or telephonic contact. This restriction recognises the need to sever ties that may perpetuate the cycle of abuse.Prohibition on Alienating AssetsEconomic abuse is a prevalent form of domestic violence. Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 addresses this by prohibiting the respondent from alienating assets without the leave of the Magistrate. This includes assets jointly held by the parties, such as bank accounts, lockers, or property. Such safeguards are vital in preserving the financial independence and security of the survivor.Protection of Dependents and Other RelativesRecognising that domestic violence often has ripple effects on dependents and other relatives, Section 18 of Domestic Violence Act, 2005 prohibits the respondent from causing violence to these individuals. This broader protection ensures that the impact of domestic violence is mitigated not only for the survivors but also for those connected to them.Compliance with the Protection OrderThe catch-all provision in Section 18(g) prohibits the respondent from committing any other acts as specified in the protection order. This flexibility allows the Magistrate to tailor the protection order to the specific circumstances of the case, ensuring a comprehensive and effective safeguard for the aggrieved person.Challenges and Implementation of Section 18 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005While Section 18 provides a robust legal framework for protecting survivors of domestic violence, its effective implementation faces challenges. Adequate awareness, law enforcement and judicial personnel training and community outreach are essential components in realising the intended protections.ConclusionSection 18 of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 empowers Magistrates to issue protection orders in cases of domestic violence. After providing both the aggrieved person and respondent an opportunity to be heard, the Magistrate, when prima facie satisfied that domestic violence has occurred or is likely, can pass orders prohibiting the respondent from committing further violence.This includes restrictions on aiding or abetting violence, entering specific places, communicating with the aggrieved person, alienating assets, causing harm to dependents, and complying with any other act specified in the protection order. These measures aim to safeguard the rights and well-being of individuals facing domestic violence.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Amalgamation of Trade Unions",
    "data": "                      Amalgamation of trade unions holds paramount importance within the legal framework, serving as a strategic mechanism for union collaboration. This process, governed by meticulous legal provisions, entails the merging of distinct unions to forge a singular, formidable entity.Meaning of Amalgamation of Trade UnionsAmalgamation of trade unions is when two or more trade unions join together to make a new union. This can happen because the unions want to do it themselves or the government or a regulatory authority tells them to.The unions might decide to amalgamate for different reasons, like wanting more power when bargaining, making the organisation work better or dealing with fewer members. By putting together their resources and members, the unions can make a more powerful and unified voice for the workers.Amalgamation of Trade Unions under Trade Unions Act, 1926Section 24 of the Trade Unions Act, 1926 talks about trade unions coming together, combining their efforts to create a single union. This can happen with or without dissolving or dividing their funds. For this to occur, at least half of the members of each trade union must vote and 60% of the casted votes should support the proposal.Moving on to Section 25 of the Trade Unions Act, 1926, it deals with informing the Registrar about any changes in the union’s name or if they amalgamate with another union. The secretary and seven members of the trade union changing its name or in the case of amalgamation of trade unions, the secretary and seven members of each involved trade union, must sign a written notice sent to the Registrar.If the proposed name is too similar to an existing trade union’s name, the Registrar can refuse to register the change. Once the Registrar in the state where the amalgamated union’s head office is located is satisfied that the law’s requirements are met, the amalgamation of trade unions is officially recognised from the registration date.In a legal case, D.C.M. Chemical Masdoor Ekta Union v. Registrar of Trade Unions, Delhi (1978), the Delhi High Court clarified that the Registrar has the authority to register a trade union under Section 25, similar to Section 8. Whether the registration is done under Section 8 or Section 25, the Registrar must issue the certificate of registration. It was emphasised that Section 10 covers situations where fraud or mistake is used to gain both the registration and the certificate of registration. Therefore, seeking the reversal of a Section 25 judgment doesn’t provide a remedy to cancel the certificates of registration, as Section 10 applies to both situations.Legal Requirements for AmalgamationThe legal requirements for amalgamation of trade unions can vary by jurisdiction and the specific trade unions involved. Generally, the following procedures must be followed to ensure lawful and proper execution:Approval from Members: Members of each union must approve the amalgamation of trade unions through a vote or referendum, typically by a simple or two-thirds majority.Notice to Regulatory Agencies: Unions must notify relevant regulatory agencies, such as labour boards or government departments, about their intention to amalgamate.Amalgamation Agreement: Unions need to develop an amalgamation agreement outlining the terms and conditions, approved by members and submitted to regulatory agencies.New Union Registration: Once approved, the new union must register as a legal entity, providing necessary documents to regulatory agencies. In the case of amalgamating two trade unions, the process must adhere to relevant laws and procedures set by the Central Government, as highlighted in the State of Punjab v. Punjab State Electricity Board.Procedure for Amalgamation of Trade UnionsSection 25 of the Trade Unions Act, 1926 details the procedure for amalgamation of trade unions. A written notice about the name change after amalgamation must be served as specified.Registration of Amalgamated Trade UnionsUpon satisfying the conditions, the Registrar registers the amalgamation by making an entry in the Register and issues a certificate. The amalgamation of trade unions takes effect from the date of registration.Effects of Amalgamation of Trade UnionsAs per Section 26 of The Trade Unions Act, 1926, a change in the name of a registered trade union doesn’t impact its rights and obligations or affect ongoing legal proceedings. Similarly, the amalgamation of registered trade unions does not prejudice the rights of the unions or any creditors.Advantages and Disadvantages of Amalgamation of Trade UnionsAdvantages of AmalgamationIncreased Bargaining Power:Amalgamation of trade unions enhances bargaining power, enabling unions to negotiate better wages, benefits and working conditions by presenting a united front to employers.Improved Organisational Efficiency:By eliminating duplicative efforts and streamlining administrative processes, amalgamation enhances organisational efficiency, leading to cost savings and more effective resource utilisation.Greater Political Influence:Amalgamated unions wield increased political influence at both national and international levels, allowing them to advocate for legislative and policy changes that benefit workers.Greater Member Engagement:Amalgamation of trade unions fosters greater member engagement. With a larger membership base, unions can provide more programs and services, fostering a stronger connection between members and the organisation.Disadvantages of AmalgamationLoss of Autonomy:Amalgamation of trade unions results in a loss of autonomy for individual unions as they form a new centralised structure, limiting their ability to make decisions specific to their members.Cultural Differences:Challenges may arise if amalgamating unions have different cultures or histories, requiring time for members to adjust to new leadership, structures and processes.Increased Bureaucracy:Amalgamation can lead to heightened bureaucracy as the new union establishes policies, procedures and governance structures, potentially diverting resources from other activities.Membership Disputes:Amalgamation of trade unions may trigger membership disputes, with members of original unions disagreeing with the new union’s rules, policies or leadership, resulting in factionalism and a loss of unity.Financial Costs:Significant financial costs, including legal fees, administrative expenses and integration costs, may arise from an amalgamation of trade unions, placing strain on the new union’s finances, especially in the short term.ConclusionAmalgamation of trade unions involves the merging of two or more unions to form a single entity, pooling resources and members for increased bargaining power. This process, governed by legal requirements, aims to enhance organisational efficiency and political influence. Advantages include strengthened negotiation positions and improved member engagement.However, challenges such as loss of autonomy, cultural differences, increased bureaucracy, membership disputes and financial costs may arise. Overall, amalgamation is a strategic move to create a unified voice for workers but requires careful navigation of potential drawbacks.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Marz ul Maut",
    "data": "                      This article explores “Marz ul Maut,” a concept in Islamic law about giving gifts when someone is very sick or close to passing away.This legal practice is important in Islam and the article will discuss how it works, its conditions and how it differs between Sunni and Shia traditions.Marz ul Maut MeaningMarz ul Maut signifies gifts made during one’s deathbed. It refers to the practice of bequeathing assets or property when an individual is approaching the end of life due to illness or the anticipation of imminent death.The term is derived from Arabic, where “Marz” translates to sickness or malady and “Maut” means death. Marz ul Maut involves specific conditions for validity, including a clear declaration of the gift, acceptance by the recipient and the actual or constructive transfer of possession. This concept is crucial in Islamic laws, outlining the legal framework for gifts made under the unique circumstances of impending death.Essential Conditions for Marz ul MautGifts made during one’s deathbed are not without limitations, mainly because it is challenging for the parties involved (heirs and the recipient) to prove the validity of the gift. This difficulty arises from the nature of oral bequeathing and the need for clear evidence. Marz ul Maut, in essence, resembles a gift and must meet the conditions outlined for Hiba (gift). These conditions include:An explicit and unambiguous declaration of the gift by the donor;The declaration, whether oral or written;Acceptance of the gift by the donee, either explicitly or implicitly;Actual or constructive delivery of the possession of the subject matter.Marz ul Maut is considered a gift due to its similarity in conditions with Hiba. However, there is a distinction in the case of Marz ul Maut, where only 1/3rd of the property can be bequeathed to the donee, in contrast to a gift intervivos, which may involve the entire property. This limitation aligns with the principles of Wills or Wasiyat, where only 1/3rd of the property can be given away to protect the rights of heirs. The same restriction applies to Marz ul Maut, unless the heirs provide consent.This unique blend of the Law of Wills (Wasiyat) and the Law of Gifts (Hiba) categorizes Marz ul Maut as a gift but with the requisites of a Will under Mohammadan Law, highlighting its “Hybrid or Amphibious” nature.In the case of Cain v. Moon, the Judicial Committee emphasised that the decisive factor in determining the validity of the gift is whether the deed of gift was executed by the donor under the apprehension of death.Apprehension of DeathThe subjective nature of the apprehension is highlighted in the case of Hassarat Bibi v. Golam Jaffar, where the definitions and indications of a death-illness are specified:The donor should be suffering from a sickness or malady ultimately causing their death.The sickness should induce fear or apprehension of death in the person, making them believe they are going to die.The illness should render the person unable to attend to their day-to-day tasks, as mentioned in Mustak Ahmed v. Abdul Wahid and Karimamssa Bibi v. Hamidua.A person with a long-standing sickness suddenly taking a serious turn, spiralling into the apprehension of death.In Mumtaz Ahmed v. Wasi-un-Nissa, it was established that the doctrine of Marz ul Maut applies only when the gift is made under the imminent pressure of death. It is akin to an intuition for the patient that they are going to die with no chance of recovery.Test for Marz ul MautIn the case of Shaik Nurbi v. Pathan Mastanbi and others, the necessary conditions for a valid deathbed gift (Marz ul Maut) were outlined as follows according to Mohammedan Law:The illness or malady must have directly caused the donor’s death.The sick person must have some subjective apprehension of death or a preponderance of death.External indicators, such as the inability to attend to ordinary activities, must be present.Delivery of possession must occur (derived from Hiba).In evaluating each case of a deathbed gift, the specific facts and circumstances must be examined independently to determine if the sickness qualifies as Marz ul Maut. It’s crucial to note that the person should die specifically from the sickness or malady in question. If death results from another cause, Marz ul Maut could be considered a Hiba, provided all Hiba essentials are met. The donee must prove that the deathbed gift resulted from the donor’s apprehension of death and that the death was caused by the sickness present at the time of making the gift.Regarding the second requirement, the person suffering from illness should make the gift due to the fear or apprehension of death from the sickness. This should be visibly observed and confirmed by those attending to the person, including physicians. The definition of death-illness is considered valid if it is highly probable to issue fatally.The third condition necessitates that the sick person’s illness is of such a nature that they are unable to carry out their daily routines.In Mustak Ahmed v. Abdul Wahid, it was stated that Marz ul Maut or mortal sickness, is characterized by a fear of death for the sick person, an inability to attend to business and death occurring within a year due to the condition, regardless of confinement to a deathbed.If the illness is prolonged and a year passes without a change in the sick person’s state, they are considered akin to a healthy person. However, if the illness worsens and the person dies before a year passes from the time of change, their state is classified as mortal sickness.Viewpoint of Marz ul Maut from Various AnglesIn this section, we will delve into important topics such as the diseases covered under Marz ul Maut, deathbed gifts in other religions and the consideration of Marz ul Maut as a contract.Diseases under Marz ul MautFor Marz ul Maut to be applicable, the donor or testator must be unwell. The nature of sickness can vary and it is important to note that the apprehension of death differs from person to person. Some may succumb to common cold due to a weakened immune system, while others may face more severe illnesses like cancer. It is not mandatory for the person to be bedridden; the sickness should, however, hinder the individual from performing their daily activities.With advancements in medicine, individuals with life-threatening illnesses can extend their lives beyond a year. Therefore, when determining Marz ul Maut, it is crucial to consider that the illness becomes mortal again from the point when it is deemed as such by a physician. Simple diseases like diabetes and blood pressure, manageable with modern medicine and lifestyle changes, do not fall under mortal sickness.Conditions such as paralysis, diabetes, asthma, etc., are generally not considered mortal sickness unless they are severe and pose a medical concern. The case of Muhammad Gulshere K. v. Mariyam B. emphasized that long and lingering diseases, diluting the apprehension of death over a period exceeding one year, do not qualify as sickness for Marz ul Maut.On the other hand, rapid consumption and galloping conditions, like pneumonia, fall under the doctrine of Marz ul Maut when they induce thoughts of imminent death and render the person helpless. In such cases, if the person makes a gift, it can be considered a Marz ul Maut.Deathbed Gifts in Other ReligionsIn Hindu law, gifts made due to the apprehension of death, known as Donatio Mortis Causa, are also valid. This is governed by Section 191 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925. In the case of Deo Saran v. Deoki Bharathi, the essential conditions for a gift are outlined. The gift can be either movable or immovable property, contingent on the death of the donor due to sickness.Other Legal Effects of Marz ul MautMarriage Contracted on Death BedA marriage contracted on the deathbed is considered invalid. However, there is a provision to validate it: if the person survives the illness and remains alive, consummation of the marriage will render it valid.Death-Bed WaqfWaqf is a concept in Islam governed by the Waqf Act, 1995. It refers to an endowment made by a Muslim for religious, educational or charitable purposes.A deathbed waqf is subject to the same rules that govern other deathbed dispositions. It will take effect only up to 1/3rd of the property unless the heirs provide their consent.Comparison of Applicability of Marz ul Maut in Shia and Sunni LawIn Sunni and Shia Islamic traditions, the applicability of Marz ul Maut (gifts made during one’s deathbed) varies in several aspects. In Sunni law, the consent of all heirs is imperative for bequests to an heir.On the other hand, in Shia law, a bequest up to 1/3rd of the property is considered valid even without unanimous consent. Regarding bequests to an unborn child, Sunni law validates it only if the child is born within 6 months of making the will (Marz ul Maut), while Shia law extends this period to 10 months.The act of giving birth to a child is deemed under Marz ul Maut in Sunni law but not under Shia law. Additionally, the acknowledgement of debt on the deathbed in favour of an heir is non-effective in Sunni law, whereas Shia law recognizes and binds such acknowledgments up to 1/3rd of the property. These distinctions highlight the nuanced differences in the application of Marz ul Maut between Sunni and Shia legal traditions.ConclusionMarz ul Maut refers to gifts made during one’s deathbed, recognized under both Sunni and Shia laws. This legal concept addresses the conditions and implications of bequests made by individuals approaching the end of their life due to illness or imminent death.For a Marz ul Maut to be valid, specific criteria must be met, including an explicit declaration of the gift, acceptance by the donee and actual or constructive delivery of the possession. The amount that can be bequeathed and the rules surrounding Marz ul Maut vary between Sunni and Shia traditions, adding complexity to the understanding and application of this legal principle within Islamic inheritance laws.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Punishment for Domestic Violence in India",
    "data": "                      Domestic violence remains a pressing issue in India, posing a significant threat to individuals and families. However, steps have been taken to address this problem through legislation such as the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005. This Act is vital in combating domestic violence by providing legal protection and remedies for victims. It offers a range of solutions, including protection orders, residence orders, monetary relief, custody orders, and compensation for injuries.What Constitutes Domestic Violence?According to Section 3 of the Domestic Violence Act 2005, domestic violence is characterised by the following:Threat to Health, Life, and Safety: Domestic violence can manifest as mental or physical abuse, including acts of sexual, verbal, economic, and emotional nature. It involves any behaviour that threatens the victim’s health, life, and safety.Harassment includes any form of harassment that causes injuries to the victim or coercion on the victim or other people associated with the victim. It may involve unlawful demands for property, dowry, or valuable security, such as jewellery or other assets.Harm or Injury: Domestic violence encompasses causing harm or injury to the victim through physical or mental means. This can include acts of physical aggression, emotional abuse, or any other harm inflicted upon the victim.In the case of Vajresh Venkatray Anvekar v. State of Karnataka, the court held that the belief that one or two incidents of beating are insufficient to drive a woman to commit suicide is unacceptable. The court emphasised that assault on women cannot be accepted as a social norm. In the case of V.D. Bhanot v. Savita Bhanot, it was held that a woman of 63 years, with no means of sustenance after 31 years of marriage, compelled to live alone, falls within the definition of “domestic violence.”Different Types of Domestic AbuseDomestic abuse can take various forms, including:Physical Abuse: Physical abuse involves any violent act that causes pain and suffering to the victim, such as slapping, biting, kicking, hitting, or beating. It may also include forcing someone to use drugs or alcohol against their will or denying them necessary medical treatment.Economic Abuse: Economic abuse occurs when the abuser attempts to or makes the victim financially dependent on them. This can involve controlling the victim’s finances, limiting their access to money, or preventing them from obtaining employment or educational opportunities.Technological Abuse: Technological abuse involves using technology to control or manipulate a partner. This can include monitoring their online activities, controlling their access to electronic devices or social media, or using technology to harass or intimidate them.Punishment for Domestic Violence under Indian Penal Code & Criminal Procedure CodeCriminal law in India primarily addresses the punishment for domestic violence in India through two key legislations: the Indian Penal Code (IPC) and the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC). Section 498-A: CrueltySection 498-A of the IPC deals with acts of cruelty against women committed by their husbands or their relatives. The section prescribes punishment, including imprisonment for up to three years and a fine. Cruelty, as defined in the Explanation to Section 498-A, encompasses various willful acts that can drive a woman to contemplate suicide, cause physical or mental harm, or involve harassment to extort money from her relatives.In the Social Action Forum for Manav Adhikar v. Union of India, the constitutional validity of Section 498-A was upheld. The court also established guidelines for investigating officers, emphasising their duty of care while handling such cases.The Supreme Court has expressed concerns regarding the misuse of Section 498-A. In the case of Rajesh Sharma v. State of U.P., the court noted the tendency to implicate all family members based on general allegations to resolve marital disputes. It observed that many complaints were filed impulsively over trivial issues, lacking sincerity. Unwarranted arrests and the non-compoundable nature of the offence caused hardships for the parties involved and hindered the possibility of settlement. The court emphasised the need for comprehensive investigations to address these concerns.In addition to Section 498-A, the IPC also includes provisions to punish husbands in cases of dowry death under Section 304-B. It also addresses offences related to grievous hurt, hurt, and abetment to suicide.Section 125, CrPC: Maintenance OrdersSection 125 of the CrPC enables obtaining maintenance orders for wives, children, and parents. This provision aims to prevent hardships rather than impose punitive measures. The definition of a wife under Section 125 is broad, encompassing not only married women but also divorced women, second wives, and women in live-in relationships. However, it does not include women whose marriages are void.Punishment for Domestic Violence under the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 There must be a domestic relationship between the perpetrator and the victim to seek legal recourse for domestic violence. A domestic relationship is between two individuals who live or have lived together in a shared household and are related by consanguinity, marriage, or a relationship similar to marriage. The term “like marriage” has been broadly interpreted. In the case of Indra Sarma v. V.K.V. Sarma, the Supreme Court laid down guidelines for determining whether a live-in relationship falls within the scope of a relationship “like marriage.” However, in the case of D. Velusamy v. D. Patchaiammal, it was held that a one-night stand or weekend together does not establish a domestic relationship.Eligibility for Remedies under the Domestic Violence Act, 2005According to Section 2(a) of the Act, an aggrieved person, who can avail remedies under the Act, refers to a woman who is or has been in a domestic relationship with the perpetrator and alleges to have experienced domestic violence. Thus, even if the woman is no longer in a relationship with the respondent, she can still seek remedies under the Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act, 2005.Scope of Domestic Violence Act, 2005Section 2(q) of the Act defines respondents as individuals who can be considered perpetrators of violence against women. In the case of Hiralal P. Harsora v. Kusum Narottamdas Harsora, it was held that the definition is not limited to adult males but also includes women and non-adult males. This landmark judgment overruled the previous ruling in Ajay Kant Sharma v. Alka Sharma. In the Sandhya Manoj Wankhade v. Manoj Bhimrao Wankhade, it was held that female relatives could be considered “relatives” of the husband or male partner under the Act. The legislature never intended to exclude female relatives from the Domestic Violence Act 2005 provisions, even though the term “female” is not explicitly used in Section 2(q). The expression “relative” should not be given a restrictive meaning, nor has it been defined as specific to males only.Remedies Under the Protection Of Women Against Domestic Violence Act, 2005The major remedies available under the Act are as follows:Right To Reside In A Shared Household (Sections 17& 19)Section 17(1) of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 stipulates that every woman in a domestic relationship has the right to reside in the shared household, irrespective of her ownership or interest in the property. Section 17(2) further prohibits the respondent from evicting or excluding the aggrieved person from the shared household. However, in the case of Vimlaben Ajitbhai Patel v. Vatslaben Ashokbhai Patel, the court clarified that the woman’s right of residence under the Act is limited to joint properties in which the husband has a share, and she is not entitled to the respondent’s property.In the case of Ishpal Singh Kahai v. Ramanjeet Kahai, it was held that the victim could apply to the court for a residence order concerning the shared household, including their matrimonial home, regardless of her ownership or interest in the property.The relief of residence orders is provided under Section 19 of the Act. According to Section 19, the magistrate can pass residence orders that include:Restraining the respondent from dispossessing or disturbing the possession of the aggrieved person in the shared household, regardless of the respondent’s legal or equitable interest in the property.Directing the respondent to vacate the shared household.Restraining the respondent or any of their relatives from entering the portion of the shared household where the aggrieved person resides.Restraining the respondent from alienating or encumbering the shared household.Restraining the respondent from renouncing their rights in the shared household, except with the leave of the magistrate.Directing the respondent to provide the same level of alternate accommodation for the aggrieved person as enjoyed in the shared household or to pay rent for such alternate accommodation if necessary.However, in the case of S.R. Batra v. Taruna Batra, it was clarified that the wife’s claim for alternative accommodation under Section 19(1)(f) can only be made against her husband and not against her in-laws or other relatives.Protection Orders (Section 18)Section 18 of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 empowers the magistrate to issue a protection order based on their prima facie opinion. This order prohibits the respondent from engaging in various actions, including:Committing any act of domestic violence.Aiding or abetting in the commission of acts of domestic violence.Entering the place of employment of the aggrieved person or, in the case of a child, their school or any other place frequented by them.Attempting to communicate with the aggrieved person in any form, including personal, oral, written, electronic, or telephonic contact.Alienating any assets, operating bank lockers, or bank accounts jointly or singly held by both parties, including the aggrieved person’s stridhan or any other property held jointly or separately by the parties, without the magistrate’s permission.Inflicting violence on the dependents, other relatives, or anyone who assists the aggrieved person against domestic violence.Committing any other act specified in the protection order.In the case of Madhusudan Bhardwaj v. Mamta Bhardwaj, it was established that two important factors need to be proved in favour of the aggrieved woman: (i) an opportunity of hearing to the parties and (ii) prima facie satisfaction of the occurrence of domestic violence or the likelihood of its occurrence. However, it was clarified that the requirement of providing an opportunity for a hearing does not imply that such orders can only be passed after the hearing.Furthermore, in the case of Saraswathy v. Babu, it was held that the parties’ conduct before the commencement of the Domestic Violence Act, 2005 can be considered while issuing orders under Sections 18, 19, and 20 of the Act. This allows for the examination of relevant conduct even before the Act came into effect.Monetary Reliefs (Section 20)The adjudicating magistrate has the authority to order the perpetrator to provide monetary relief to compensate for the expenses and losses incurred by the aggrieved woman and any children as a result of domestic violence. This monetary relief may include:Loss of earnings: Compensation for the income that the aggrieved woman could not earn due to the domestic violence.Medical expenses: Reimbursement of medical costs incurred by the aggrieved woman or the child as a result of the violence.Loss of property: Compensation for any damage, destruction, or removal of property from the control of the aggrieved woman.Maintenance: The remedy of maintenance provided under this section is in addition to the maintenance order granted under Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code.It is important to note that the monetary relief granted must be adequate, fair, and reasonable, and it should be consistent with the standard of living to which the aggrieved woman is accustomed.In the case of Ajay Kumar v. Lata, the courts allowed a claim for maintenance against the brother of the deceased husband. This was permitted based on the shared household in ancestral joint Hindu family property and joint business between the brother and the deceased husband. The court confirmed the direction for interim maintenance in this case.Custody Orders (Section 21)Section 21 of the Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act grants authority to the magistrate to issue temporary custody orders for any child or children involved in the case. The aggrieved person can be granted custody of the child or children, either with or without visitation rights, for the respondent. This provision ensures that the welfare and best interests of the child are considered during the proceedings.Compensation Orders (Section 22)Section 22 of the Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act empowers the magistrate to direct the payment of compensation and damages for physical and mental injuries caused by domestic violence. This provision acknowledges the harm inflicted upon the aggrieved person and provides a mechanism for obtaining financial redress.Other Civil RemediesIn addition to the Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act, other civil remedies are available to address issues related to domestic violence. These include:Divorce: A legal dissolution of marriage.Judicial Separation: A legal arrangement where spouses live separately without terminating the marriage.Restitution of Conjugal Rights: A legal remedy that enables one spouse to request the court’s intervention for the resumption of marital cohabitation.Maintenance: A legal obligation for one spouse to provide financial support to the other spouse during or after separation or divorce.Alimony: Financial support provided by one spouse to the other after divorce or separation to meet their ongoing needs.These civil remedies may be pursued in conjunction with or separately from the Protection of Women Against Domestic Violence Act, depending on the specific circumstances and requirements of the aggrieved person.ConclusionThe punishment for domestic violence in India is governed by the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act 2005. The Act provides for various measures to address domestic violence, including protection orders, residence orders, monetary relief, custody orders, and compensation for injuries. Perpetrators can face legal consequences such as restraining orders, financial compensation, and temporary loss of custody rights. The severity of punishment depends on the nature and gravity of the offence.Also, Section 498-A of the Indian Penal Code punishes cruelty against women, while Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code provides for maintenance orders.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Process of Conciliation",
    "data": "                      Conciliation is a non-adjudicatory alternative dispute resolution (ADR) process to resolve conflicts between parties. It is a voluntary and confidential method of resolving disputes to facilitate communication, understanding, and agreement between the parties involved.In conciliation, a neutral third party, known as the conciliator, assists the parties in reaching a mutually acceptable resolution. The conciliator acts as a facilitator, helping the parties identify and explore the issues in dispute, understand each other’s perspectives, and find common ground for agreement.Conciliation is governed by specific procedures and guidelines, which may vary depending on the jurisdiction or the applicable laws. In India, the process of conciliation is regulated by legislation such as the Arbitration and Conciliation Act.Principles of Process of ConciliationThe principles of conciliation as discussed under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act are:Independence and Impartiality (Section 67(1))The conciliator must maintain independence and impartiality throughout the conciliation process. They should assist the parties unbiasedly and fairly while striving to reach an amicable settlement.Fairness and Justice (Section 67(2))The conciliator should adhere to principles of objectivity, fairness, and justice. This involves considering the rights and obligations of the parties, relevant trade practices, and the circumstances surrounding the dispute, including any prior business dealings between the parties.Confidentiality (Sections 75, 70, proviso)All matters relating to the conciliation proceedings are to be treated as confidential by the conciliator and the parties involved. If a party provides information with the condition of confidentiality, the conciliator must not disclose that information to the other party without consent.Disclosure of Information (Section 70)When the conciliator receives information regarding any facts related to the dispute from one party, they should disclose the substance of that information to the other party. This allows the other party to provide an appropriate explanation.Cooperation of Parties with Conciliator (Section 71)The parties are expected to cooperate in good faith with the conciliator. This includes submitting written materials, providing evidence, and attending meetings as requested by the conciliator.Rules of Procedure (Section 66)The conciliator is not bound by the procedural rules outlined in the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908, or the Indian Evidence Act, 1872. However, while not strictly bound by technical procedural rules, the conciliator should still uphold the principles of natural justice.Place of Meeting (Section 69(2))The parties can agree upon the location for meetings with the conciliator. In the absence of such an agreement, the conciliator will determine the meeting place after consulting with the parties, considering the circumstances of the conciliation proceedings.Communication between Conciliator and Parties (Section 69(1))The conciliator may invite the parties to meet, communicate with them orally or in writing, and may choose to engage with the parties collectively or separately as necessary.What is the Process of Conciliation under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996?Part 3 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996 discusses the process of conciliation, which is an alternative method of resolving disputes outside of court. Conciliation is governed by the provisions outlined in the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (26 of 1996), as defined in Wharton’s Law Lexicon.Step 1: Commencement of Conciliation ProceedingsSection 62 of the Act addresses the initiation of conciliation proceedings. To begin the process, one party must send a written invitation to the other party. The conciliation proceedings can only proceed if the other party accepts the invitation. If no response is received within 30 days of sending the invitation, it will be deemed non-acceptance.Step 2: Appointment of ConciliatorsOnce the parties have agreed to engage in conciliation proceedings, appointing a conciliator is next. Section 64 covers the appointment of conciliators. If the parties agree, they can appoint a single conciliator. If the parties opt for two conciliators, each party will appoint one. In the case of three conciliators, each party will appoint one conciliator, and the parties together can agree upon a third conciliator who will act as the presiding conciliator.Step 3: Submission of Written Statements to the ConciliatorThe conciliator may request both parties to provide written statements detailing the relevant facts pertaining to the case. Both parties must submit their written statements to the conciliator. Additionally, the parties are required to exchange their written statements with each other.Step 4: Conduct of the Conciliation ProceedingsSections 67(3) and 69(1) describe the conduct of conciliation proceedings. The conciliator has the discretion to communicate with the parties through written or oral means. They can choose to meet with the parties collectively or separately. The conduct of the proceedings will be tailored to suit the case’s specific circumstances.Step 5: Administrative AssistanceSection 68 of the Act addresses the option of seeking administrative assistance. The parties or the conciliator may seek assistance from an institution or individual if necessary. However, the consent of the parties is required to engage in such administrative assistance.Termination of Conciliation Proceedings – Section 76Section 76 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act provides four ways in which conciliation proceedings can be terminated:Termination by Signing of Settlement Agreement (Section 76(a))Conciliation proceedings end when the parties involved sign a settlement agreement. The date of termination is considered to be the date on which the settlement agreement is signed.Termination by Conciliator’s Declaration (Section 76(b))The conciliation proceedings can be terminated if the conciliator declares in writing that further efforts at conciliation are no longer justified. The date of termination is the date of the conciliator’s declaration.Termination by Written Declaration of Parties (Section 76(c))The parties have the authority to terminate the conciliation proceedings by providing a written declaration to the conciliator stating that they wish to end the proceedings. The date of termination is the date of the declaration.Termination by Party’s Written Declaration to Other Party and Conciliator (Section 76(d))A party can unilaterally terminate the conciliation proceedings by sending a written declaration to both the other party and the conciliator, expressing their intention to terminate the proceedings. The date of termination is the date of the declaration.Case Laws Relating to Conciliation ProcessHaresh Dayaram Thakur v. State of Maharashtra and Ors.In the case of Haresh Dayaram Thakur v. State of Maharashtra and Ors. (AIR 2000 SC 2281), the Supreme Court examined the provisions of Sections 73 and 74 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996. In paragraph 19 of the judgment, the court made the following observations:According to the statutory provisions mentioned above, it is evident that a conciliator’s role is to assist the parties in settling their disputes amicably. The conciliator is granted broad powers to determine the procedure to be followed without being bound by procedural laws such as the Code of Civil Procedure or the Indian Evidence Act 1872.When the parties are able to reach a mutual agreement, and the conciliator believes that there is a potential settlement acceptable to the parties, the conciliator should follow the procedure outlined in Section 73. This involves formulating the settlement terms and presenting it to the parties for their observations. The final step for the conciliator is to draft the settlement based on the parties’ observations.The settlement becomes legally binding only when the parties themselves draw up the settlement agreement or request the conciliator to prepare it and affix their signatures. As per Sub-section (3) of Section 73, once the parties sign the settlement agreement is considered final and binding on them and any individuals claiming under them.Mysore Cements Ltd. v. Svedala Barmac Ltd. In the case of Mysore Cements Ltd. v. Svedala Barmac Ltd. (AIR 2003 SC 3493), the court discussed Section 73 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. The court made the following observations:Section 73(1) states that when the conciliator believes that there are elements of a possible settlement that may be acceptable to the parties, they should formulate the terms of the potential settlement and present them to the parties for their observations. Upon receiving the parties’ observations, the conciliator may reformulate the settlement terms accordingly.However, in the present case, the court did not find any such formulation and reformulation by the conciliator, as required under Sub-section (1). Sub-section (2) states that if the parties reach a settlement agreement based on the possible terms of settlement formulated, they may draft and sign a written settlement agreement. Sub-section (3) clarifies that when the parties sign the settlement agreement, it becomes final and binding on them and any individuals claiming under them. Furthermore, Sub-section (4) requires the conciliator to authenticate the settlement agreement and provide each party with a copy.ConclusionConciliation is a valuable alternative dispute resolution process guided by the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. It involves a neutral conciliator assisting parties to settle. The process begins with a written invitation, followed by the appointment of a conciliator. Written statements are exchanged, and the conciliator conducts proceedings based on fairness and justice.

    "headline": "Appeal under CPC",
    "data": "                      An appeal in CPC serves as a vital avenue for seeking redress and ensuring justice. When parties involved in a court proceeding are discontented with the judgment, they can turn to the higher courts for a fresh evaluation of their case. This process empowers individuals to present compelling arguments and challenge the lower court’s decision on legal or factual grounds. Meaning of Appeal in CPCThe concept of ‘appeal’ is not explicitly defined in the CPC (Code of Civil Procedure). According to the Black’s Law Dictionary, ‘appeal’ is the formal complaint made to a higher court to rectify an injustice or error committed by a lower court. The Superior Court, to which the appeal is made, reviews and retrials the case, effectively transferring it from a court of lower jurisdiction to one with greater authority.Essentials of AppealsAn appeal under CPC is a legal process in which a higher forum reviews the decision of a lower forum on both legal and factual grounds. The higher forum has the jurisdiction to either uphold, reverse, modify the decision, or send the case back to the lower forum for a fresh decision, following the directions given by the higher forum. The three essential elements of appealing cases can be summarised as follows:A decree issued by a judicial or administrative authority.An aggrieved individual who may not have been a party to the original proceeding.A reviewing body was established specifically to handle such appeals in CPC.Right to AppealThe right to appeal is both statutory and substantive. It is a statutory right because it must be specifically granted by a statute and establish the appellate machinery. Unlike the inherent right to institute a lawsuit, the right to appeal is provided by law. Additionally, the right to appeal is substantive, meaning that it must be exercised prospectively unless the statute states otherwise. However, parties may waive this right through an agreement, and accepting benefits under a decree may stop a party from challenging its validity. It’s important to note that the right to appeal is determined based on the law as it exists at the time of the original suit.One Right to Appeal in CPCThere is usually one right to appeal, as stated in Section 96 of the CPC. This allows an aggrieved party to appeal a decree passed by a court exercising its original jurisdiction to a higher authority designated for this purpose. Exceptions to this single right of appeal are outlined in Sections 97, 98, and 102 of the CPC, which specify certain conditions under which no further appeal is permitted.No Right to Appeal under CPCIn general, a person who is not a party to the suit does not have the right to appeal unless they obtain special leave from the Court. The crucial factor to consider when determining one’s right to appeal is whether the person is adversely affected by the decision or the suit, and this is a matter of fact that must be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.Who Can File an Appeal?The right to appeal in CPC is available to specific categories of individuals:Any party to the original proceeding or their legal representatives.Any person claiming under such a party or a transferee of interests from such a party.Any person appointed by the Court as the legal guardian of a minor.Any other aggrieved person, with the Court’s permission.The general rule is that only a party to a suit who has been adversely affected by the decree or their representatives can file an appeal in CPC. However, with the Court’s leave, a person not originally involved in the case may also appeal if they are bound by the decree, aggrieved by it, or maliciously influenced by it. To determine if a party is aggrieved, it must be shown that the judgment has unjustly affected their rights, whether financially or otherwise. A judgment cannot be said to adversely impact a party unless it acts as res judicata against them in future litigation. The content of the judgment and decree, rather than the form, should be evaluated to determine if it will have this effect.Section 96(2) outlines remedies available to a defendant against whom an ex parte order is passed. They can either file an appeal under CPC against the decree or file a motion to set aside the ex parte decree. These remedies can be pursued concurrently and do not hinder each other.However, Section 96(3) specifies that a consent decree cannot be appealed against. This provision is based on the principle of estoppel, assuming that parties to a suit may, through a lawful agreement, settlement, or behaviour, relinquish their right to appeal. In a consent decree, both parties have willingly given up their right to appeal in CPC as part of the agreement.Who Cannot File an Appeal in CPC?To summarise the situations in which parties may not have the right to appeal:A party that has explicitly and unambiguously given up its right to appeal as per an arrangement or agreement.A party that has received benefits from a decree and has implicitly accepted its terms.A consent decree binds parties, as they have willingly agreed to its terms.Parties whose evidence or compromises were not presented or expressed during the dispute.Parties involved in trivial instances where the matter is not significant enough to warrant an appeal in CPC.Furthermore, legal representatives are not allowed to file an appeal under CPC on behalf of a deceased individual. Once a party passes away, their right to appeal also ceases to exist.Characteristics of An AppealThe right to appeal is not automatically assumed and must be explicitly provided for in the statute. It differs from the rights associated with filing cases, as it is a substantive right rather than a procedural one. These rights arise from the moment the suit is instituted. Once granted, these privileges cannot be invalidated unless a statute expressly or implicitly allows for such invalidation. The appellate authority has the final and conclusive discretion in matters related to appeals.Form of Appeal: Rules For an appeal to be considered valid, it must adhere to all the provisions specified in the Memorandum of Appeal. Rule 2 prohibits the appellant from raising objections that are not outlined in the memorandum of appeal, except with the Court’s permission. This rule is intended to inform the respondent of the specific case they are expected to address during the appeal hearing. If the memorandum of appeal in CPC is not in the appropriate form, the Court has the discretion to reject it or send it back to the appellant for necessary amendments.Rule 4 explains that if a decree is based on a common ground that applies to all the plaintiffs or defendants, each of them has the right to appeal under CPC against the entire decree. The Court may then either reverse or modify the decree collectively favouring all the plaintiffs or defendants. This rule allows multiple parties who share a common interest in the case to collectively challenge the decree on the shared ground.Condonation of Delay  The Amendment Act of 1976 introduced Rule 3A, which states that if an appeal is filed after the prescribed limitation period expires, the appellant must submit a statement explaining the reasonable grounds for the delay in filing the appeal. The purpose of this rule is twofold: firstly, to inform the appellant that the delayed appeal in CPC may not be accepted until the Court considers the application justifying the delay, and secondly, to alert the respondent that the appellant may not be immediately prepared to argue on the merits of the case, as the Court needs to address the application for condonation of the delay as a preliminary matter. However, it is essential to note that this clause is considered a directory and not mandatory.Stay of ProceedingsRules 5 to 8 deal with the provision for a stay of execution of a decree or order during the appeal process. Rule 5 allows the appellate Court to order a stay of proceedings under the decree or the enforcement of the decree once an appeal under CPC has been filed. However, it’s important to note that the mere filing of an appeal does not automatically suspend the implementation of the decree.The purpose of Rule 5 is to protect the interests of both the party who obtained the decree and the party against whom the decree was passed. For the Court to grant a stay, the following conditions must be met:The application for a stay must be filed without any undue delay.The party seeking the stay must demonstrate that they would suffer significant harm if the order is not granted.The applicant must provide adequate security to ensure the due performance of the decree or order in case the appeal is unsuccessful.If these conditions are satisfied, the Court may also issue an ex parte order for a stay of execution pending the hearing of the appeal without requiring the other party’s presence. This allows for immediate protection of the appellant’s interests while the Court considers the matter further.Summary Dismissal Rule 11 pertains to the trial court’s authority to summarily dismiss an appeal in CPC. This process occurs after the appellant has submitted the memorandum of appeal and the appeal has been filed in accordance with Rule 9. Rule 11 enforces the fundamental principle that the appeal court has the right to dismiss an appeal without a full hearing if it finds that it lacks merit after hearing the appellant or their counsel.However, this discretionary power should be exercised judiciously and not in an arbitrary manner. The Court should use this control only in exceptional circumstances and with restraint. In other words, the summary dismissal of an appeal should be rare and sparingly applied.The purpose of Rule 11 is to allow the appeal court to swiftly dispose of frivolous or meritless appeals, thus preventing unnecessary delays and ensuring that the Court’s resources are used efficiently. However, this authority should not be misused, and the Court must be cautious not to deny legitimate appeals that may require a full hearing for proper adjudication.Doctrine of Merger The concept of the merger theory is rooted in the principle that there should not be multiple operative decrees governing the same subject matter simultaneously. As a result, when an appeal is adjudicated by an appellate court, the decree of the trial court no longer remains effective under the provisions of the statute. Instead, it is replaced by the decree passed by the appellate Court, and the decree of the trial court effectively combines or “merges” with the decree of the appellate Court.Cross ObjectionsOrder 41 Rule 22 is a special provision that permits the respondent, who has not filed an appeal against the decree, to raise objections to the decree by filing cross-objections in response to the appeal filed by the other party. However, filing cross-objections is purely discretionary and voluntary for the respondent. This provision is permissive and encouraging rather than being mandatory or obligatory.Cross-objections should not be confused with cross-appeals under CPC. A cross-appeal is when the respondent, who is typically the plaintiff in the original case, brings an appeal against the appellant (typically the defendant) if they are dissatisfied with a particular aspect of the judgment, even if the overall decree is in their favour due to other findings.The terms of Order 41 Rule 22 only permit the right to file cross-objections when an appeal is filed and the appellate Court accepts the appeal, issuing a notice to the respondent. Only after the appeal is accepted and the Court notifies the respondent the process of filing cross-objections may begin.It is important to note that cross-objections cannot be filed if the appellant has filed no appeal or if an appeal has been filed but has not been accepted by the Court. In such cases, the respondent cannot raise objections through cross-objections.Powers of Appellate Court under CPCThe appellate Court is granted several powers under Section 107 and the corresponding rules of Order 41 of the Code of Civil Procedure:Power to decide a case finally (Section 107(l)(a) and Rule 24)When the evidence on record is sufficient, the appellate Court can make a final decision on the case, even if the judgment of the lower Court was based on different grounds.Power of remand (Section 107(1)(b) and Rule 23)If the trial court decides the case on a preliminary point without considering other issues, and the appellate Court reverses that decree, it can remand the case back to the trial court to decide the remaining issues and reach a decision.Power to frame issues and refer them for trial (Section 107(1)(c), Rules 25 and 26)If the trial court fails to frame an issue or overlooks a crucial factual question, the appellate Court can frame those issues and refer them for trial to the lower Court. The lower Court is directed to take the additional evidence required to properly determine the case.Power to take additional evidence (Section 107(1)(d), Rules 27-29)Generally, the appellate Court decides the appeal in CPC based on the evidence presented during the original trial. However, the Court may admit additional evidence if the party requesting it demonstrates that this evidence was not available during the initial trial despite their best efforts. The other party must have an opportunity to challenge the additional evidence, which should be relevant to the issues under consideration.Power to modify the decree (Rule 33)The appellate Court is empowered to grant or refuse relief to the appellant and provide suitable relief to the respondents as necessary. The Court can make any decision it deems appropriate, not just between the appellant and the respondent but also between two respondents.These powers enable the appellate Court to ensure fair and just adjudication of the case based on the evidence and merits presented before it.First Appeal in CPCAccording to Section 96 of the CPC, a regular first appeal can be filed against a decree passed by any Court exercising original jurisdiction, except when expressly prohibited. Analysing Sections 2(2), 2(9), and 96 of the CPC together, it becomes evident that a first appeal may or may not be maintainable in certain adjudications.Second Appeal in Civil Procedure CodeSection 100 of the CPC provides for a second appeal under this code. It stipulates that an appeal may be filed to the High Court from a decree passed in the first appeal by a subordinate Court, except where contrary provisions exist. However, the jurisdiction exercised under this section is limited to substantial questions of law framed either at the time of admission of the appeal or subsequently.Conversion of an Appeal into RevisionIn the case of Bahori v. Vidya Ram, it was established that since there is no specific provision under the CPC for the conversion of an appeal into a revision or vice versa, the Court can only exercise its power under Section 151. Though discretionary, the Court’s inherent powers allow it to issue orders necessary to meet the ends of justice. The only prerequisite for such conversion is that proper procedures are followed during the filing of the original appeal or revision under the Civil Procedure Code.Appeals from Orders of the TribunalWhen parties involved in proceedings are dissatisfied with the orders or conclusions of the tribunal, they have the option to submit an appeal to the National Company Law Appellate Tribunal (NCLAT). The Company Act, 2013, in Section 421, elaborates on the process as follows:Either one or both parties aggrieved by an order of the tribunal may file an appeal under CPC with the appellate tribunal.An appeal cannot be filed with the tribunal without the consent of both parties.The appeal must be filed with the NCLAT within forty-five days of the tribunal’s order, in the prescribed form, and accompanied by the required fees.In exceptional circumstances, if the tribunal is convinced that there is sufficient cause for not filing the appeal within the forty-five-day period, it may allow the appeal to be filed beyond this period, but it cannot extend beyond the forty-five days limit.After giving both parties a reasonable opportunity to be heard, the tribunal may pass appropriate orders.The tribunal has the authority to either confirm, modify, or set aside the order being appealed against.The appellate authority is responsible for sending a copy of the order to the tribunal and the parties involved in the appeal in CPC.Appeals By Indigent PersonsIf a person is unable to pay the required fee for filing a memorandum of appeal Civil Procedure Code, they have the option to file an appeal as an indigent person. However, the Court has the discretion to reject such an application and may direct the applicant to pay the necessary court fee within a specified time.Appeals To The Supreme CourtAppeals to India’s highest jurisdictional body, the Supreme Court, can be made under two circumstances. Firstly, when the lower Court considers the case appropriate for an appeal to the Supreme Court, and secondly, when the Supreme Court grants special leave for the appeal Civil Procedure Code. A petition must be submitted to the Court that issued the decree to file an appeal under CPC. The petition will be heard and disposed of within sixty days. It should state the grounds of appeal and include a request for a certificate declaring that the case involves a substantial question of law that requires the Supreme Court’s decision.The opposite party will have an opportunity to raise objections to the issuance of such a certificate. The petition will be disposed of if the certificate is denied. If the certificate is granted, the appellant must deposit the required security and costs within a specified period. After fulfilling these obligations, the Court from whose decision the appeal in CPC is made will declare the appeal as admitted and notify the respondent accordingly. The jurisdictional body will then provide a sealed copy of the record and furnish copies of the relevant papers in the suit.ConclusionAn appeal in CPC is a legal process through which a party dissatisfied with a court’s decision seeks a review and reconsideration of the judgment by a higher court. It allows parties to challenge the lower court’s ruling on specific legal or factual grounds and present arguments for a different outcome.The process of appeals in the legal system plays a crucial role in ensuring justice and fairness. Understanding the various provisions and powers involved in filing appeals can be instrumental in achieving favourable outcomes for parties dissatisfied with trial court decisions. From first appeals to second appeals and the option for indigent persons to file appeals, the legal framework aims to address grievances effectively. Additionally, the avenues for appeals to the Supreme Court provide a vital recourse for cases deemed appropriate for further review. Overall, a comprehensive grasp of the appeal process empowers individuals to navigate the legal system with confidence, seeking redress for their grievances.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Differences Between Cheque and Bill of Exchange",
    "data": "                      The Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881 deals with negotiable instruments such as bills of exchange, promissory notes, cheques, etc. Chapter XVII contains Sections 138 to 142, introduced to repose confidence in the efficacy of banking operations and thereby give credibility to negotiable instruments used in all business transactions. According to Section 13 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881, A “negotiable instrument” means a promissory note, bill of exchange, or cheque payable to order or bearer. Thus, a negotiable instrument means any written document transferable on delivery. Meaning of a Cheque A cheque is a widely used payment instrument in various business transactions. It contains the payer’s date, written amount, and signature, instructing a bank or financial institution to pay a specified sum to the bearer. When the payee presents the cheque to the bank, the funds are deducted from the payer’s account as if an order was given to transfer the specified amount from the payer’s account to the payee’s account. The individual who makes the payment is referred to as the “payer,” while the one who receives the payment is known as the “payee.” Cheques are typically drawn against a specific account designated for payment, but they can also be used to withdraw funds from savings or other accounts.Cheque under the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881Section 6 of the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881 states that a “cheque” is a bill of exchange drawn on a specified banker and not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand, and it includes the electronic image of a truncated cheque and a cheque in the electronic form.Explanation –“a cheque in the electronic form” means a cheque that contains the exact mirror image of a paper cheque and is generated, written, and signed in a secure system ensuring the minimum safety standards with the use of a digital signature (with or without biometrics signature) and asymmetric cryptosystem; “a truncated cheque” means a cheque that is truncated during a clearing cycle, either by the clearing house or by the bank, whether paying or receiving payment, immediately on a generation of an electronic image for transmission, substituting the further physical movement of the cheque in writing. Features of a ChequeCheques are drawn from a bank and are payable on demand without requiring a formal acceptance. They can be payable to a bearer on demand or to the drawer. In certain cases, a cheque may involve more than two parties. The person filling out the cheque provides their name and details on the top-left-hand side, while the bank’s name, holding the drawer’s account, is also present on the cheque.The following details are to be filled out by the drawer:The date, which is located on the top-right corner of the cheque.The payee’s name, written on the first line at the centre of the cheque, indicates the recipient’s name or business.The amount in words is mentioned below the payee’s name.The amount in rupees is written in the small box next to the payee’s name.A signature on the bottom right-hand corner of the cheque.At the bottom edge of the cheque, beneath the drawer’s signature line, there are numbers representing the bank’s routing number, identification code, and transit number, indicating where the account is held.Meaning of Bill of Exchange When transactions involve cash, payment is received immediately. However, when goods are sold or bought on credit, payment is deferred to a later date. In such cases, the selling firm usually relies on the buyer to make the payment on the agreed-upon due date. To mitigate the risk of delay or default, some firms utilize a credit instrument that assures the seller of timely payment according to the agreed terms. In India, credit instruments have been used historically in the form of “Hundies” written in various Indian languages. Today, these credit instruments are known as “Bills of Exchange,” which consist of an unconditional order, signed by the maker, to pay a specific sum of money on a designated date. The Bills of Exchange are regulated by the Negotiable Instruments Act of 1881.Bill of Exchange under Negotiable Instruments ActSection 5 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 states that a “bill of exchange” is an instrument in writing containing an unconditional order, signed by the maker, directing a certain person to pay a certain sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain person or the bearer of the instrument. According to Section 5 of the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881, a “bill of exchange” possesses the following characteristics:It must be a written instrument.It constitutes a demand or order for payment.The order for payment must be unconditional.It must be signed by the maker (the person issuing the bill).The specified payment amount must be complete and unambiguous.It is payable to a certain person or to that person’s order, or it can be made payable to the bearer of the instrument.The payment can be made either on-demand or on a specific future date.The bill must be duly stamped in accordance with the legal requirements.Illustration 1: Amit draws a draft on Rohit for Rs. 10,000 payable after three months. Once accepted and signed, the draft becomes a bill of exchange. Illustration 2: Mr Shiv sells goods worth Rs. 75,000 to Mr Ram. However, Mr Ram is not able to pay the sum immediately. So, Mr Shiv, the seller, draws on Mr Ram and accepts the same. The bill of exchange is hence drawn for trade purposes. Illustration 3: Mr Hari issues a bill of exchange for Mr Jerry, who purchased goods worth Rs. 50,000 on 12.12.2021 on credit. Mr Hari is the creditor for Mr Jerry, who has also drawn a bill of exchange. Mr Jerry, however, accepted the bill on 25.12.2022 only. The bill becomes a bill of exchange from the date of acceptance. Features of a Bill of ExchangeThe key characteristics of a bill of exchange are:It is an instrument in writing.It is drawn for a specific amount on a particular person (the drawee).The terms of the bill are certain and agreed upon by both parties involved.It contains an unconditional order to the drawee, directing them to pay the specified amount.The bill specifies the maturity date, indicating when the payment becomes due.The bill is signed by the maker (drawer) of the bill.It mentions the name of the bearer of the bill, who is entitled to receive the payment.It creates a sense of trust between the parties in the transaction.The bill is properly revenue stamped, meeting legal requirements.The payment must be made in the legal currency of the country.Similarities Between Cheque and Bill of ExchangeNegotiable Instruments: Both cheques and bills of exchange are considered negotiable instruments, meaning they can be transferred to another party by mere endorsement or delivery, making them a valuable means of payment and trade.Payee’s Payment Direction: Both instruments address the drawee (the party obligated to make the payment) to fulfil the payment to the specified payee or the instrument’s bearer.Written Instruments: Both cheques and bills of exchange are formal written documents that outline the terms of the payment, the parties involved, and the amount to be paid.Maker’s Signature: Both instruments require the signature of the maker (drawer) who issues the instrument, indicating their consent and liability for the payment.Payable on Demand: Both cheque and bill of exchange are payable on express demand or order, ensuring that the payment is made promptly as required.What are the Differences Between a Cheque and a Bill of Exchange?Cheques and bills of exchange are essential instruments in the world of finance and commerce, facilitating payments and trade transactions between parties. The differences between a cheque and a bill of exchange are as follows:Meaning and DefinitionA cheque is a written document used to make payments on demand and can be transferred through delivery. It is drawn on a specific banker and is payable to the bearer or a specified person. The Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 defines a cheque as an instrument drawn on a banker, expressed to be payable on demand, and includes electronic forms and truncated cheques.On the other hand, a bill of exchange is also a written document that signifies the indebtedness of a debtor to a creditor. It contains an unconditional order, signed by the maker (drawer), directing a specific person or the bearer to pay a certain sum of money. The Negotiable Instruments Act 1881 provides the definition of a bill of exchange.Governing SectionThe definitions and legal aspects of both cheque and bill of exchange are covered under the Negotiable Instruments Act 1881. The Act lays down the rules and regulations regarding these financial instruments.DrawnA cheque is drawn solely on a specific banker and is not expressed to be payable otherwise than on demand. It is meant for immediate payment.In contrast, a bill of exchange can be drawn on any person, including bankers. It may have a specific due date for payment, known as the maturity date.ValidityA cheque is valid and payable on demand to the bearer. The drawee is obliged to honour it as soon as it is presented for payment.A bill of exchange, if drawn as payable on demand, is considered void according to Section 31 of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934.PayabilityA cheque becomes payable on-demand only, and the payment is made immediately upon presentation.A bill of exchange becomes payable on the expiry of a certain date or a specified period. It is not immediately payable upon presentation but requires the passage of time until the maturity date arrives.AcceptanceA cheque does not require any formal acceptance from the payee or drawee. It is considered to be accepted when the drawee pays the amount upon presentation.In contrast, a bill of exchange requires formal acceptance from the drawee before he becomes liable for payment. Acceptance is the drawee’s explicit agreement to pay the bill as per its terms.Grace PeriodNo grace period is allowed for payments made by cheque because a cheque is always payable on demand.However, in the case of a bill of exchange, a grace period of three days is allowed while calculating the maturity date for time bills.DiscountingA cheque cannot be discounted with a bank or any other entity. It is primarily a means of immediate payment.Conversely, a bill of exchange can be discounted with a bank, allowing the holder to receive immediate cash from the bank, deducting the discount charges.StampingCheques need not be stamped before payment since they are payable on demand and have immediate validity.A bill of exchange, however, must be sufficiently stamped as per the applicable stamp duty regulations before it can be considered valid for payment.NoticeFormal notice to the drawer is not necessary when a cheque is dishonoured due to insufficient funds or other reasons.In contrast, when a bill of exchange is dishonoured, formal notice of dishonour must be given to the parties involved to ensure transparency and resolve any issues related to the dishonour.CrossingA cheque can be crossed to provide additional security and ensure payment to the rightful owner. Crossing involves drawing two parallel lines on the face of the cheque.On the other hand, crossing a bill of exchange is not allowed. It is not a common practice in bills.DishonourNo formal protest or noting is required in the case of the dishonour of a cheque.In contrast, the practice of noting and protesting is followed when a bill of exchange is dishonoured, providing a formal record of the dishonour.Discharge from LiabilityThe drawer of a cheque is not discharged from liability if the holder delays in presenting it for payment. The drawer remains liable to pay the amount mentioned in the cheque even if the payment is delayed.Conversely, the drawer of a bill of exchange is discharged from liability if it is not duly presented for payment on the due date or within the grace period, if applicable.Here’s a table summarising the key differences between a cheque and a bill of exchange:ConclusionThe above comparison highlights the key differences between a cheque and a bill of exchange. These two financial instruments serve distinct purposes in facilitating transactions and payments. While a cheque is a document used for immediate payments on demand, typically drawn by a specified banker, a bill of exchange represents a written instrument that signifies the debtor’s indebtedness towards the creditor and involves a certain period before it becomes payable.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Criminal Intimidation IPC: Section 503 IPC",
    "data": "                      The Indian Penal Code (IPC) is a comprehensive legal framework designed to uphold societal law and order. Within its provisions are various offences, including Sections 503, 504, 505, and 506, which address acts of criminal intimidation, intentional insult to incite a breach of the peace, and the making of statements leading to public mischief, respectively.What is Criminal Intimidation?The literal definition of intimidation, as per the Oxford Dictionary, is to coerce someone into acting as desired by the intimidator.As Section 503 IPC, criminal intimidation is an act committed by an individual who threatens another person with harm to their person, reputation, or property, with the intention of compelling them to perform an act that they are not legally obligated to do. The person who poses the threat is referred to as the intimidator.In such cases, the accused may use words or gestures to intimidate and cause harm to the victim’s body, property, reputation, or even to other family members.For example, consider the following illustration: A threatens to burn down B’s house to dissuade him from filing a civil suit. In this scenario, A has committed the offence of criminal intimidation. A has used a threat to cause damage to B’s property and subsequently compelled him to refrain from performing a legally required act (filing the civil suit), thereby making A guilty of the offence of criminal intimidation.Essentials of Criminal Intimidation under Sec 503 IPCThe landmark case of Narender Kumar & Ors v. State (2012) established the essential elements required to constitute the offence of criminal intimidation under Section 503 IPC:Threat of injury to the victimAccording to Section 44 of the IPC, injury refers to any unlawful damage caused to an individual, whether it pertains to their body, mind, reputation, or property.Ways in which threats can occurCriminal intimidation can take place through various means, including:a. Threatening to cause injury to a person.b. Threatening to cause injury to the reputation of the victim.c. Threatening to cause injury to the property of the victim.d. Threatening to cause injury to another person or the reputation of someone the victim is interested in.Intimidation to cause bodily harmCriminal intimidation under Section 503 IPC encompasses threats of bodily harm to another individual. Considering only physical harm under this section is essential, while mental or emotional distress should be excluded. Additionally, the threat must be specific in nature and clearly communicated to the opposing party.Intimidation to cause damage to reputationThe term “reputation” in this context refers to a person’s goodwill or standing in the eyes of the community. Therefore, any attempt or threat to harm an individual’s goodwill falls under the purview of criminal intimidation.Threatening to cause harm to the victim’s propertyProperty, whether physical or intangible, is highly valuable and represents an individual’s hard work. Thus, any warning or danger that could significantly harm their property is considered an offence under Section 503 of the IPC. This provision also applies to jointly-held properties.Threatening to harm another individual or their reputation, where the original person has a personal interestThis provision broadens the scope of criminal intimidation under Section 503 IPC. It includes threats or warnings intended to harm someone the intimidator has a personal interest in, such as their son, daughter, wife, or any other close family member. The explanation in Section 503 also covers threats to harm the reputation of a deceased person.Intention at the time of the threatThe threat should be made with the intention of:a. Causing alarm to an individual.b. Compelling an individual to perform an act they are not legally required to do to prevent the implementation of the threat.c. Forcing an individual to omit to perform an act they are legally obligated to do to prevent the implementation of the threat.The Supreme Court of India, in the leading case of Romesh Chandra Arora v. State (1960), further clarified that criminal intimidation under Section 503 IPC is not limited to the imposition of a threat but also includes situations where the threat serves as a mere warning to an individual.Threatening to cause alarm to an individualThis provision requires that the threat be intended to cause alarm, fear, or distress to the person being threatened. The term “alarm” was clarified in the case of Amulya Kumar Behera v. Nabaghana Behera Alias Nabina (1995), where the Orissa High Court equated it with words like ‘fear’ or ‘distress.’Threatening someone to do something they are not legally obligated to doIf a person threatens another individual with force or harm to compel them to perform an act that they are not legally obliged to do, it constitutes criminal intimidation under Section 503 IPC.For example, in the case of Nand Kishore v. Emperor (1927), a butcher was threatened by certain people that trading beef would lead to imprisonment and social isolation, even though trading beef was legal at that time. The Allahabad High Court held that this threat amounted to criminal intimidation.Threatening an individual to omit to perform any act they are lawfully required to doIf anyone knowingly and willingly threatens or attempts to threaten someone to refrain from performing any act that they are legally permitted to do, it will be considered criminal intimidation in IPC.Punishment for Criminal Intimidation: Section 503 IPC PunishmentThe punishment for the offence of criminal intimidation or Section 503 IPC Punishment is as per Section 506 of the IPC which provides:Simple criminal intimidationIf a person is found guilty of simple criminal intimidation under Section 503 IPC, the penalty is up to two years of imprisonment, a fine, or both. This offence is non-cognizable (police cannot arrest without a warrant), bailable (the accused can obtain bail), compoundable (can be settled with the consent of the victim), and triable by any magistrate.Hurt, grievous hurt, or death of the personSuppose the threat of the intimidator leads to causing hurt, grievous hurt or death to the person threatened or damaging any property by fire. In that case, the punishment is a maximum of seven years imprisonment, a fine, or both. This offence is non-compoundable (cannot be settled by mutual agreement) and can be tried by a first-class magistrate.The threat is to impute chastity to womenIf a person threatens a woman with imputing unchastity to her, the punishment is imprisonment of any kind for a term that can extend up to seven years, a fine, or both. This offence is non-compoundable and can be tried by a first-class magistrate.Commission of Criminal Intimidation By An Anonymous CommunicationUnder Section 507 of the IPC, there is a more serious and agitated form of criminal intimidation, which shares most of the elements with the standard criminal intimidation under Section 506. The distinguishing feature of this offence is that the intimidator commits the act anonymously without revealing their identity.The punishment for this offence includes imprisonment for a term of up to two years, a fine, or both. It’s important to note that this imprisonment is in addition to the usual punishment for criminal intimidation provided under Section 506 of the IPC.The nature of this offence under Section 507 is bailable, non-cognizable (police cannot arrest without a warrant), and non-compoundable (cannot be settled by mutual agreement). A first-class magistrate can try it.For instance, if someone abducts the daughter of a person named Ram and demands a ransom without revealing their identity while threatening to harm the daughter if the payment is not made, it would be an offence covered by Section 507.Section 508 of the IPC also deals with causing a person to believe that they will be rendered an object of divine displeasure. If an accused voluntarily induces or attempts to induce someone to do something they are not legally bound to do or omit to do something they are legally entitled to do, and convinces that person that they or someone they care about will face divine displeasure if they do not comply, then the accused is guilty.The maximum punishment for this offence is one year of imprisonment, a fine, or both. This offence is non-cognizable, bailable, and compoundable by the individual against whom the offence was committed, and any magistrate can try it.In summary, Sections 507 and 508 deal with specific forms of criminal intimidation that involve distinct elements and carry different punishments.Doraswamy Ayyar v. King-Emperor (1924)The Madras High Court established that for an act to be considered criminal intimidation under Section 503 of the IPC, the threat made must be realistic and capable of causing harm to the victim. The court ruled that threats of divine punishment alone would not be sufficient to qualify as criminal intimidation.Rajinder Datt v. State of Haryana (1992)In this case, it was determined that mere outbursts or statements made by the accused during an attack, indicating an intent to kill the victim, might not be enough to classify the act as criminal intimidation under Section 506 of the IPC. The court emphasized the need for evidence demonstrating a specific intent to cause death or grievous harm for the offence to fall under the ambit of criminal intimidation.Shri Vasant Waman Pradhan v. Dattatraya Vithal Salvi (2004)The Bombay High Court, in this case, emphasized the importance of mens rea (the guilty mind) in criminal intimidation cases under Section 503 IPC. It clarified that the core of criminal intimidation lies in the accused’s malicious intentions or malafide motives. The court highlighted that determining the intention behind the act should consider the surrounding facts and circumstances associated with the incident.Manik Taneja & Anr v. State of Karnataka (2015)In the case of Manik Taneja & Anr v. State of Karnataka (2015), the Supreme Court ruled that posting written statements on a social media platform, in this case, Facebook, about unfair treatment by the police did not constitute criminal intimidation under Section 506 of the IPC. The appellant had been involved in a car accident with an auto-rickshaw, and even after paying compensation for the passenger’s treatment, the woman in the auto-rickshaw felt incensed and complained on the Bangalore traffic police’s Facebook page. However, the court found no evidence of criminal intimidation in this situation. Vikram Johar v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2019)In the case of Vikram Johar v. State of Uttar Pradesh (2019), the Supreme Court concluded that the mere act of abusing someone in filthy language does not meet the requirements for the offence of criminal intimidation under Section 503 of the IPC. In this case, the respondent and some others went to the plaintiff’s residence, and one person in the group was carrying a pistol. They verbally abused the plaintiff and attempted to attack him, but when neighbours arrived, they ran away. The court found that the accusation, if taken at face value, did not fulfil the elements of criminal intimidation under Sections 504 and 506 of the IPC, as the insult was not severe enough to cause a person to break public peace or commit another crime.Limitation of the Provision of Criminal IntimidationChapter XXII of the IPC deals with the offence of criminal intimidation, but it appears to be inadequate to address the needs of the evolving society. With societal changes and technological advancements, the law must adapt accordingly. The concept of criminal intimidation is quite extensive, but it lacks explicit provisions for situations where individuals are coerced into committing suicide due to threats or for cases involving intimidation through online platforms. Therefore, there is a pressing need to introduce more inclusive provisions and appropriate punishments that hold societal significance for instances of criminal intimidation under Section 503 IPC.ConclusionCriminal intimidation, under IPC Sections 503 to 506, safeguards against threats and coercion. Key elements include injury threats, bodily harm, reputation damage, or property endangerment. Notably, anonymity elevates the offence (Section 507). Landmark cases guide its application. Modern cases highlight the need to adapt to technological advancements, addressing social media and inclusive provisions. Criminal intimidation in IPC undermines safety and societal harmony. Evolving laws must meet emerging challenges, ensuring just punishments that hold societal value. This fosters trust and respect, creating a safer environment for all.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Interpleader Suit CPC",
    "data": "                      Where conflicting claims and uncertainties often reign supreme, the interpleader suit stands as a beacon of clarity and fairness. This legal mechanism, often overlooked in the broader spectrum of civil procedures, serves as a vital instrument for resolving disputes over property, debts and assets.An interpleader suit is not merely a legal safeguard; it is a powerful tool designed to protect the rights of individuals and entities who find themselves caught in the crossfire of conflicting interests.What is Interpleader Suit?An interpleader suit is a legal action initiated by a person or entity holding property, funds, or assets that are claimed by two or more conflicting parties. An interpleader suit is filed when the party holding the property has no interest in it, except for potential charges or costs and seeks to avoid liability or multiple lawsuits.The primary dispute in an interpleader suit typically arises among the defendants who interplead against each other, rather than involving the plaintiff and the defendant of a case. An interpleader suit is distinguished by the fact that the plaintiff is not directly involved in the subject matter under contention. The fundamental and most significant objective of an interpleader suit is to resolve conflicting claims among rival defendants. This situation arises when there is a disputed debt, capital, or other property solely between the defendants. Essentially, an interpleader suit is initiated to adjudicate a matter concerning a third party.In an interpleader suit, it is essential for the plaintiff to maintain impartiality and avoid arbitrariness. For instance, consider the scenario where ‘A’ holds a total of Rs. 10,000, which ‘B’ and ‘C’ both claim against each other. ‘B’ and ‘C’ are brought to court by ‘A’ in an interpleader suit. During the proceedings, it is revealed that ‘A’ had previously reached an agreement with ‘B’ before filing the suit, stipulating that if ‘B’ were to win the case, he would accept only Rs. 9,000 from ‘A’ as full settlement of his claim. Since ‘A’ has an interest in the subject matter of the suit due to this arrangement, he is not eligible to initiate an interpleader suit. Consequently, the complaint should be dismissed.Section 88 and Order XXXV of CPC: Interpleader SuitsSection 88 and Order XXXV of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 encompass the provisions governing Interpleader suits.Section 88 delineates the criteria and conditions under which an interpleader suit can be initiated. It specifies the essential elements of an interpleader suit as follows:Similar Property: There must be property involved that is of a similar nature, which can include a mortgage, a sum of money, or any movable or immovable property.Multiple Claims: Two or more parties must assert competing claims against each other regarding the said property.Disinterested Claimant: The person initiating the suit (plaintiff) claiming the property must not have any interest in it, except for potential charges or expenses. This disinterest is crucial, as the plaintiff must be in a position to deliver or transfer the property to the rightful claimant.Interpleader Action: A person claiming property may commence an interpleader action against all the claimants involved. The objective is to determine which claimant is entitled to receive payment or possession of the property. Additionally, the plaintiff seeks indemnity for themselves in this process.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court, in the case of Asan v. Saroda, established that a suit cannot be considered an interpleader suit in CPC if the defendants do not assert conflicting claims against each other. Furthermore, the plaintiff must either acknowledge the title of one of the defendants or be willing to make payment or deliver the property to that defendant.The proviso to Section 88 further stipulates that no interpleader suit shall be instituted when there is an ongoing lawsuit in which the interests of both parties can be adequately determined.Order XXXV Rule 1 – Plaint in an Interpleader SuitOrder XXXV Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 pertains to the Plaint in an interpleader suit. This rule mandates certain key elements that must be included in the plaintiff’s complaint:Lack of Interest: The plaintiff, in the interpleader suit, must explicitly state that they have no interest in the subject matter of the suit or in the individual claims made by the defendants.Absence of Conspiracy: The plaintiff must unequivocally assert that there is no collusion or conspiracy between the claimants and any of the defendants throughout the course of the case.Listing Defendant’s Claims: The plaintiff is required to include all the arguments and claims presented by the defendants in the complaint.Willingness to Present Property: If the property in dispute is movable, the plaintiff must express their willingness to place it before the court for resolution.The Hon’ble Bombay High Court’s ruling in the case of Mangal Bhikaji Nagpase vs. State of Maharashtra emphasised that the plaintiff must affirm, in accordance with Rule 1, that they possess no interest in the disputed subject matter apart from potential charges or costs.Order XXXV Rule 2 – Payment of the Thing Claimed into CourtOrder XXXV Rule 2 addresses the situation where the disputed property can be paid into court or placed in the custody of the court. In such cases, the plaintiff may be obligated to take this action before being entitled to any order in the suit. The Hon’ble Patna High Court, in the case of Syed Shamshul Haque v. Sitaram Singh & Ors., clarified that the court has discretion to issue orders concerning the disputed property and the concerned party must adhere to these orders before seeking relief from the court.Order XXXV Rule 3 – Procedure where Defendant is Suing the Plaintiff in an Interpleader SuitOrder XXXV Rule 3 outlines the procedure to be followed when a defendant in an interpleader suit is also suing the plaintiff regarding the subject matter of the suit. In such instances, the court in which the suit against the plaintiff is pending must stay the proceedings upon being informed by the court where the interpleader suit was initiated. The costs incurred by the defendant in the stayed suit should be provided for within that particular suit.Order XXXV Rule 4 – Procedure at First Hearing in Interpleader SuitOrder XXXV Rule 4 addresses the procedure at the first hearing of an interpleader suit. This rule provides the court with certain powers and options:Plaintiff’s Release from Liabilities: The court has the authority to release the plaintiff from all liabilities at the first hearing. Consequently, the court may grant the plaintiff their costs and dismiss the case. This means that if the court determines that the plaintiff has no further role or responsibility in the matter, they can be discharged from the suit.Retention of Parties: However, if the court believes that it is necessary for the sake of justice, propriety, or convenience to retain all parties to the suit, the plaintiff may not be discharged until the suit reaches its final resolution. This discretion allows the court to determine whether it is appropriate to release the plaintiff or to keep them involved in the proceedings.Framing and Trying Other Issues: If the court deems it suitable, it may also order that additional issues be framed and tried concurrently with the suit. Furthermore, the court may allow any complainant (i.e., the defendant in the interpleader suit) to be made a plaintiff, either in place of or in addition to the original plaintiff, if deemed necessary.Order XXXV Rule 5 – Who cannot file Interpleader suit?Order XXXV Rule 5 outlines who is ineligible to file an interpleader suit. In the case of Jugal Kishore & Anr. v. Bhagwan Das, the court clarified that certain parties cannot initiate an interpleader suit in CPC. Specifically, agents cannot sue their principals and tenants cannot sue their landlords with the intention of compelling these principals or landlords to interplead with individuals other than those claiming through them.Order XXXV Rule 6 – Charge of Plaintiff’s CostOrder XXXV Rule 6, the final rule in this order, deals with the charge of the plaintiff’s costs. When an interpleader suit is appropriately initiated, the court will determine how the original plaintiff’s costs will be compensated. This compensation may be obtained by charging the plaintiff a fee equivalent to the amount in dispute or by utilising a similar method that proves to be equally effective and successful.Essentials of an Interpleader SuitBefore initiating an interpleader suit in CPC, the following conditions must be met as per Section 88:Disputed Debt or Property: There must be a disputed debt, sum of money, or other property, whether movable or immovable.Multiple Claimants: Two or more persons must be making adverse claims to this debt, money, or property.Disinterested Claimant: The person from whom the debt, money, or property is claimed should not have any interest in it, except for charges and costs. They must be willing and ready to pay or deliver it to the rightful claimant.No Pending Suit: There should be no other pending suit where the rights of the rival claimants can be properly adjudicated.Who may File an Interpleader Suit?As per the case of Robinson v. Jenkins (1890), a person who has no interest in the debt, money, or property except for the charges and costs incurred by them and is prepared to pay or deliver it to the rightful claimant, may file an interpleader suit in CPC.The Reinstitution of Interpleader SuitWhere interpleader suit may be reinstituted and Power to state case for the opinion of the Court is defined under Section 88 and 90 of the Code of Civil Procedure 1908. An interpleader suit may be reinstituted when multiple defendants blame each other for claiming the same property, debt, or sum of money from the plaintiff, who is not in direct possession of the property, does not claim any interest and is willing to deliver the property. However, if a suit related to res judicata (a matter already adjudicated upon) is pending in one court, a similar suit cannot be instituted in another court.The Object of Filing Interpleader SuitAn interpleader suit in CPC is typically filed with the following objectives:Adjudication of Claims: The suit aims to adjudicate the competing claims made by the defendants, thereby determining the rightful claimant.Property Distribution: In cases where a person passes away without transferring property to other family members, a family member may need to claim the property or money from a bank. The bank, in turn, may initiate an interpleader suit to decide who should receive the property. This type of suit is filed in the court where the doctrine of res judicata applies.Procedure for Filing Interpleader SuitThe procedure for interpleader suits is governed by Order 35, Rules 1 to 4 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. Here is a summary of these rules and two landmark cases related to interpleader suits:Rule 1: In every interpleader suit, the plaintiff must include the following statements in the plaint:The plaintiff claims no interest in the subject matter in dispute except for the charges and costs.The claims have been made by the defendants separately.There is no collusion between the plaintiff and any of the defendants.The court may also order the plaintiff to deposit the disputed amount or place the property in the custody of the court, providing the plaintiff with a charge on the thing claimed to cover the costs incurred.Rule 4: According to this rule, the court has the authority to declare that the plaintiff is discharged from all liability, award them costs and dismiss them from the suit at the first hearing. Based on the available evidence, the court may also adjudicate the title to the property in dispute. If adjudication is not feasible, the court may direct that issues be framed and tried between the parties and one of the claimants may be made a plaintiff either instead of or in addition to the original plaintiff. The suit then proceeds in an ordinary manner.Landmark Cases on Interpleader SuitNeeraj Sharma v. The District Sangrur Khadi GramIn this case, the Punjab and Haryana High Court clarified that agents and tenants are not allowed to file interpleader suits against their principals and landlords, as per Order XXXV Rule 5 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. A tenant cannot sue their landlord when the dispute does not involve parties who have claimed through the landlord. Interpleader suits are intended to resolve claims made through the person initiating the suit. If someone is claiming a right and interest in the property without reference to the landlord and demanding rent, such claims are not maintainable.Hanumanth Vajhula Jagannadha v. Vajhula Annapurna RajesswarammaThis case deals with excess execution questions, where property not covered by the decree is delivered in execution of the decree. The court clarified that in such situations, an appeal under Section 47 of the Code of Civil Procedure is the appropriate recourse for the judgment debtor to recover the property that was delivered in excess of the decree. It emphasises that a separate action is not necessary in such cases.ConclusionSection 88 and Order XXXV of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 deals with interpleader suit. These provisions serve to safeguard individuals who act in good faith from facing condemnation due to their non-fulfillment of certain duties, particularly in cases where they have no vested interest in property or where they are the complainants seeking resolution of disputes over property or debt.By providing protection for a person’s right to legal costs in such scenarios and by facilitating the determination of rightful claims, interpleader suit help ensure fairness and justice in civil proceedings. However, in cases where these rights are not adequately protected or are ignored by the courts, individuals can resort to an appeal process as outlined under Order XLIII Rule 1 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Sahara vs SEBI",
    "data": "                      Case Name: Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited and Others v. Security and Exchange Board of India (Sahara vs SEBI)      Civil Appeal No.: 8643 OF 2012Court: Supreme Court of IndiaBench: Justice Altamas Kabir, Justice Surinder Singh Nijjar, Justice J.ChelameswarDate of Judgment:  5th December 2012In our current society, capitalism reigns supreme and corporate development on a massive scale is regarded as the pinnacle of progress. However, unchecked growth in this sector brings with it inherent risks. Such transgressions by corporate entities can disrupt the overall fabric of a capitalist society.Among the myriad socio-economic offences, the Sahara India investor fraud case stands out as a notable example. It represents a significant milestone in legal history, encapsulated in the Supreme Court ruling of Sahara vs SEBI in 2012. This legal battle spanned five gruelling years, pitting the Sahara Group against the regulatory authority of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).Background of Sahara vs SEBISahara India Pariwar is an Indian conglomerate headquartered in Lucknow, India, with diverse business interests encompassing finance, infrastructure, housing, media and entertainment, consumer merchandise retail ventures, manufacturing and information technology. Founded by Subrata Roy in 1978 in Gorakhpur, the group operates an extensive network of 4,799 establishments under the Sahara India umbrella. Subsidiaries of this conglomerate, Sahara India Real Estate Corporation Limited (SIRECL) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation (SHICL), are primarily involved in the acquisition and development of land for residential housing projects across India.The Sahara India Pariwar investor fraud case revolves around the failure of the Subrata Roy-led Sahara India Pariwar to honour its commitment to return more than Rs 24,000 crore, along with accrued interest, to its investors. This commitment was made pursuant to a directive from the Supreme Court of India, following a protracted legal battle with the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI).SIRECL and SHICL initiated an offering of Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) and began soliciting subscriptions from investors starting on April 25, 2008 and continuing until April 13, 2011. During this period, the companies amassed a total collection exceeding Rs 17,656 crore. This colossal sum was procured from approximately 30 million investors under the guise of a “Private Placement,” circumventing the regulatory requirements applicable to public offerings of securities. It was during this time that SEBI intervened in response to Sahara’s assertion that they had raised approximately Rs 24,000 crore from an estimated three crore investors, often in increments ranging from Rs 2000 to Rs 20,000. In November 2010, SEBI had already barred the two companies from further fundraising through Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs).Facts of Sahara vs SEBIIn 2008, the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) imposed a ban on Sahara India Financial Corporation, preventing it from raising additional deposits. The growth of Sahara’s business empire had always been shrouded in mystery, with suspicions that it operated a Ponzi scheme by collecting funds from investors. The group relied on a continuous influx of fresh capital to sustain its operations. With the RBI closing the door on collecting deposits from the public, Sahara needed a financial instrument that could bypass RBI’s oversight while still accessing public funds.Sahara decided to issue Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) by establishing two companies: Sahara India Real Estate Corporation (SIREC) and Sahara Housing Investment Corporation (SHIC). The Registrar of Companies (ROC) had to grant approval for these investment vehicles.Several factors contributed to the complex legal situation. Firstly, the sheer scale of the issue made it essentially a public offering. Any company seeking funds from more than 50 individuals had to obtain approval from the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and adhere to SEBI’s disclosure requirements. The Sahara group had sought investments from nearly 30 million investors. In addition to the size and number of investors, another deliberate oversight was keeping the offering open-ended, whereas such issues should typically close within six weeks. In fact, a Sahara group company kept an issue open for 10 years, raising Rs 17,250 crore.Sahara’s troubles escalated when the group attempted to raise funds through Sahara Prime City by tapping into the stock markets. In doing so, the company had to file a Red Herring Prospectus and disclose financial information about other group companies. It was during this process that K M Abraham identified irregularities with SIREC and SHIC, revealing that the money raised through OFCDs was disguised as private placements.Abraham discovered that despite collecting significant sums of money, Sahara group companies lacked proper records of their investors’ identities, raising questions about how and to whom the funds would be returned. Even professional agencies were unable to trace the investors.The Sahara group contested SEBI’s findings by taking the matter to the Securities Appellate Tribunal (SAT). However, SAT upheld SEBI’s findings, emphasising the significance of Sahara’s failure to disclose the vast number of investors in their Red Herring Prospectus.Sahara then escalated the matter to the Supreme Court, but in August 2012, the court ordered the group to repay over Rs 24,000 crore to SEBI within 90 days. SEBI would then distribute these funds to genuine investors. However, Sahara claimed to have already repaid most of the money over the past year, leaving just over Rs 5,000 crore pending.In October, the Supreme Court expressed frustration with Sahara’s delay tactics and hinted at the possibility of detaining the group’s officials until the payments were made. The Supreme Court Bench noted that previous orders had not been complied with, leading to the summons of Subrata Roy and other directors to explain the delay. Subrata Roy did not appear, resulting in a non-bailable warrant and an order to appear before the court on March 43 (likely a typographical error, presumably referring to March 4).Issues Raised in the Case The issues raised in Sahara vs SEBI were:1. Jurisdictional Dispute: The primary issue in Sahara vs SEBI revolves around the jurisdictional authority to investigate and adjudicate on the matter. It questions whether the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has the legal authority to handle this case under Sec 11, 11A, 11B of the SEBI Act and Sec 55A of the Companies Act, or if it falls under the purview of the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) based on Sec 55A (c) of the Companies Act.2. Classification of OFCDs as Securities: Another critical issue in Sahara vs SEBI pertains to the classification of Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) as “securities” within the definitions provided by the Companies Act, SEBI Act and the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA). This classification determines whether SEBI has the jurisdiction to investigate and adjudicate on this financial instrument.3. Private Placement vs. Public Issue: The case questions whether the issuance of OFCDs to a large number of subscribers qualifies as a private placement, exempting it from the regulatory oversight of SEBI and various provisions of the Companies Act. The distinction between private placement and public issue is central to this matter.4. Applicability of Listing Provisions: Sahara vs SEBI raises the issue of whether the provisions outlined in Section 73, which pertain to listing requirements, are mandatory for all public issues or if their application depends on the “intention of the company” to seek a listing.5. Application of Preferential Allotment Rules: It is questioned whether the Public Unlisted Companies (Preferential Allotment Rules) 2003 apply in this case and have relevance to the issuance of OFCDs.6. Classification of OFCDs as Convertible Bonds: The final issue in Sahara vs SEBI is whether OFCDs should be classified as convertible bonds and whether they are exempted from the application of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA) under the provisions of Sec 28(1)(b).These issues highlight the complex legal and regulatory challenges surrounding the Sahara India Pariwar investor fraud case, with significant implications for the jurisdiction, classification and regulatory oversight of financial instruments like OFCDs.Arguments of the Petitioner1. SEBI’s Jurisdiction under Section 55A of The Companies Act: The petitioner in Sahara v SEBI argued that according to Section 55A of The Companies Act, 1956, SEBI’s authority is limited to seeking information and investigating companies listed on the stock market. Since the Sahara companies’ applications for listing were still pending during the investigation, the petitioner contended that SEBI had no authority to request information from these companies.2. Mandatory Listing Requirement: The petitioner asserted that the listing requirement outlined in Section 73 of the Companies Act is not mandatory and only applies to companies that have the intention to get listed. Forcing any company to seek a stock exchange listing was seen as a violation of corporate autonomy.3. SEBI’s Jurisdiction Based on DRHP Filing: The petitioner in Sahara vs SEBI further argued that according to Section 60B, if a company files a Draft Red Herring Prospectus (DRHP) directly with the Registrar of Companies, it can collect funds directly from the public and in such cases, SEBI has no jurisdiction over the company.4. Nature of OFCDs and Private Placement: The petitioner contended that the Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) issued by the two Sahara companies were hybrid instruments and they were placed privately. Sahara companies claimed exemption under the provisos to Section 67(3) of the Companies Act because the Information Memorandum specified that OFCDs were issued only to individuals related to the Sahara Group and there was no public offering involved.5. Unlisted Public Companies (Preferential Allotment) Rules 2003: The petitioner in Sahara v. SEBI also argued that the Unlisted Public Companies (Preferential Allotment) Rules 2003 allowed preferential allotment by unlisted public companies on private placement without any restriction on the number of allottees, as per Section 67(3) of the Companies Act. The petitioner emphasised that these rules were amended in 2011 with prospective effect, not retrospective, providing the liberty to make preferential allotment to more than 50 persons before the 2011 Rules were implemented.Arguments of the Respondent1. SEBI’s Jurisdiction over Public Offers: The respondent countered in Sahara vs SEBI the petitioner’s claim by asserting that SEBI has jurisdiction over any company that makes an offer to the public at large, regardless of whether it is a private or public company. The respondent emphasised SEBI’s role as a regulatory authority with authority over companies making public offers.2. Classification of OFCDs as Securities: The respondent in Sahara versus SEBI further argued that the Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) issued by the two companies should be classified as securities within the definitions provided by the Companies Act, SEBI Act and SCRA. These OFCDs were offered to millions of people, leaving no doubt about their marketability. The inclusion of the term “debenture” in the name of the instrument indicated it should be treated as a security under the relevant provisions.3. Deemed Public Offer under Section 67(3): The respondent invoked Section 67(3) of the Companies Act, which stipulates that when any security is offered to and subscribed by more than 50 persons, it will be deemed to be a public offer. Consequently, SEBI would have jurisdiction in such cases and the issuer would be obligated to comply with the various provisions of the legal framework for a public issue.These arguments represent the core legal positions of both the petitioner and the respondent in the Sahara India Pariwar investor fraud case, highlighting the dispute over SEBI’s jurisdiction, the nature of OFCDs and the classification of the offering as a public or private placement.Supreme Court’s Observations and Rulings in Sahara vs SEBI1. SEBI’s Jurisdiction: The Supreme Court ruled in Sahara vs SEBI that SEBI does indeed possess the authority to investigate and adjudicate in this matter. It emphasised that SEBI’s powers are intended to protect the interests of investors and are not in conflict with the Companies Act. The Court pointed out that SEBI’s powers are supplementary and should be read harmoniously with existing laws. SEBI has special powers and there is no jurisdictional conflict between the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (MCA) and SEBI when it comes to safeguarding investor interests. This ruling underscores the importance of SEBI’s role in overseeing securities-related matters.2. Classification of OFCDs as Securities: The Supreme Court held that even though the Optionally Fully Convertible Debentures (OFCDs) issued by the two companies are hybrid instruments, they still qualify as securities under the definitions provided by the Companies Act, SEBI Act and Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA). The Court stressed that the broad offering of OFCDs to millions of individuals confirmed their marketability as securities and the inclusion of “debenture” in their name solidified their classification as securities.3. Deemed Public Offer under Section 67(3): The Supreme Court in Sahara v SEBI further ruled that when any security is offered to and subscribed by more than 50 persons, it is deemed to be a public offer under Section 67(3) of the Companies Act. Consequently, SEBI has jurisdiction in such cases and the issuer must comply with the various provisions of the legal framework for a public issue. The Sahara companies exceeded the threshold statutory limit set forth in Section 67(3) and thus, they violated listing provisions, incurring civil and criminal liabilities.4. Mandatory Listing Requirement: The Supreme Court rejected the petitioner’s argument in Sahara v. SEBI that the listing requirement under Section 73 of the Companies Act is not mandatory and applies only to companies that “intend to get listed.” The Court ruled that as long as the law is clear and unambiguous and securities are issued to more than 49 persons under Section 67(3), the intention of the companies to get listed is irrelevant. Section 73(1) is a mandatory provision and companies must comply with it, obliging them to apply for the listing of their securities on a stock exchange.5. Unlisted Public Companies (Preferential Allotment) Rules 2003: The Supreme Court clarified that the Unlisted Public Companies (Preferential Allotment) Rules 2003 apply solely in the context of preferential allotment by unlisted companies. If the preferential allotment constitutes a public issue, the 2003 Rules do not apply.6. Nature of OFCDs and Applicability of SCRA: The Supreme Court in Sahara vs SEBI dismissed the Sahara companies’ argument that OFCDs, being convertible bonds, were exempt from the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Act (SCRA) under Section 28(1)(b). The Court clarified that Section 28(1)(b) only excludes convertible bonds and shares/warrants of a specific type from the applicability of the SCRA, but it does not exclude debentures, which are a distinct category of securities under Section 2(h) of the SCRA.These observations and rulings by the Supreme Court in Sahara versus SEBI provide legal clarity on the jurisdiction of SEBI, the classification of OFCDs as securities, the implications of exceeding the threshold for a public offer under Section 67(3) and the mandatory nature of listing requirements under Section 73 of the Companies Act. The Court’s decisions have significant implications for regulatory oversight in the financial markets and investor protection.Judgment of Supreme Court in Sahara vs SEBIIn its judgment, the honorable Supreme Court of India issued several critical directives in the Sahara v. SEBI case:1. Refund of Deposits with Interest: Sahara India Pariwar was ordered by the Supreme Court to refund the entire amount of deposits it had collected, along with an interest rate of 15% applied until the date of the refund. This ruling aimed to protect the interests of the investors who had been affected by the OFCD issue.2. SEBI’s Authority: The Supreme Court not only upheld SEBI’s authority but also empowered it further by granting the regulator the legal means to enforce the refund order. This demonstrated the Court’s commitment to investor protection and ensuring regulatory oversight in financial markets.3. Non-Bailable Warrant: The Court issued a non-bailable warrant for the arrest of Sahara India Pariwar Chairman and other members who failed to comply with the refund order. This action underscored the seriousness of adhering to the Court’s directives and compliance with SEBI’s regulations.ConclusionThe Sahara vs SEBI case holds significant importance in India’s corporate and regulatory landscape. It serves as a landmark judgment in safeguarding the interests and financial well-being of investors in cases of corporate and share-market irregularities. This case clarifies various legal aspects related to the issuance of securities by unlisted companies and addresses the exploitation of legal loopholes.Furthermore, the judgment reinforces SEBI’s authority and investigative powers, enabling it to address matters concerning investor interests, even when they involve unlisted companies. By closing jurisdictional gaps between the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and SEBI, this ruling promotes regulatory consistency and investor protection.Overall, the Sahara vs SEBI case exemplifies the Indian judiciary’s commitment to upholding transparency, fairness and accountability in financial markets, thereby safeguarding the interests of investors and maintaining the integrity of the corporate sector.Sahara vs SEBI SummaryIn the Sahara vs. SEBI case, the Supreme Court of India ruled in favour of the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), reinforcing its authority and investor protection measures. Sahara India Pariwar was ordered to refund all deposits collected with a 15% interest rate, and SEBI was granted the power to enforce this order.Sahara vs SEBI clarified SEBI jurisdiction’s to investigate and regulate companies, even if they were not listed on stock exchanges. Additionally, the Court closed jurisdictional gaps between the Ministry of Corporate Affairs and SEBI. This landmark case serves as a pivotal example of upholding transparency, accountability, and investor interests in India’s corporate landscape, setting important precedents for regulatory enforcement and investor protection.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Shah Bano Case Summary",
    "data": "                      The Shah Bano case was a pivotal legal matter that had substantial consequences for the rights of Muslim women. It raised important questions about support and the rights of women. This case centred on Shah Bano’s request for financial support from her husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. The case drew attention to the absence of clear rules regarding financial support in Muslim personal law.Additionally, this case underscored the clash between personal laws and the concept of a uniform civil code, which aims to have a common set of rules governing personal matters, irrespective of one’s religious beliefs. The case sparked a nationwide discussion about women’s rights and gender equality. It also prompted conversations about the necessity to address these inequalities and protect the rights of Muslim women.The Shah Bano case had substantial political and social consequences. It caused a public outcry, with some parts of society perceiving it as an intrusion into religious affairs, while others regarded it as an essential step in securing women’s rights.Case Name: Mohd. Ahmed Khan vs Shah Bano Begum and Ors [Shah Bano case]Equivalent Citation: AIR 1985 SC 945Date of Judgment: April 23, 1985Case Number: Civil Appeal No. 7454 of 1981Case Type: Civil AppealPetitioner: Mohd. Ahmed KhanRespondent: Shah Bano Begum and othersBench/Judge: Chief Justice Y.V. Chandrachud, Justice D.A. Desai, Justice O. Chinnappa Reddy, Justice R.S. Pathak and Justice M. Hameedullah BegIssue: The case dealt with the issue of maintenance for Muslim women.Facts of the CaseMohd Ahmed Khan, a lawyer, married Shah Bano Begum in 1932 and they had three sons and two daughters. In 1975, when Shah Bano was 62 years old, her husband disowned her and ejected her from their marital home, along with their children. In 1978, she filed an appeal before the Judicial Magistrate of Indore because she had been left without the monthly maintenance of Rs. 200 that her husband was supposed to provide. She requested an increased maintenance of Rs. 500 per month.Later, her husband pronounced irrevocable triple talaq on November 6th, 1978, using it as a defence to avoid paying maintenance. In August 1979, the magistrate ordered the husband to pay a total of Rs. 25 per month as maintenance. In July 1980, Shah Bano appealed to the High Court of Madhya Pradesh to increase the maintenance to Rs. 179 per month and the high court granted her request.The husband challenged the High Court’s decision in the Supreme Court through a special leave petition.Issues Raised in Shah Bano CaseThe issues raised in Shah Bano case were:Whether the “WIFE” definition include a divorced Muslim woman?Whether it override personal law?Whether a Muslim husband’s obligation to provide maintenance for a divorced wife is in or not in the conflict between section 125 and Muslim Personal Law?What is the sum payable on divorce? The meaning of Mehar or dower is not summed payable on divorce?Petitioner’s ArgumentsMaintenance under the Muslim Personal Law Board: The petitioner in Shah Bano case argued that the responsibility for providing maintenance to Muslim women rested with the Muslim Personal Law Board and civil courts lacked the authority to grant maintenance to Muslim women under Muslim Personal Law.Shariah Law: The petitioner contended that according to the principles of Shariah Law, as interpreted by the Muslim Personal Law Board, a Muslim husband was not obligated to provide maintenance to his divorced wife beyond the iddat period, which is three months after the divorce.Interpretation of the Quran: The petitioner in Shah Bano case argued that the Quran did not mandate Muslim husbands to offer maintenance to their divorced wives beyond the iddat period.Constitutional Validity of Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code: The petitioner claimed that Section 125 of the Criminal Procedure Code, which addresses maintenance for wives, children and parents, was unconstitutional because it contradicted personal law principles.Discrimination against Muslim husbands: The petitioner in Shah Bano case maintained that requiring Muslim husbands to provide post-iddat maintenance constituted discrimination against them, as this requirement did not apply to husbands of other religions.Respondent’s ArgumentsThe Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986: The respondent in Shah Bano case argued that this act, which aimed to overturn the Supreme Court’s decision, was constitutional and essential for safeguarding the rights of Muslim women.Interpretation of Quranic Injunctions: The respondent contended that the Quranic guidelines on maintenance and divorce should be interpreted in a manner consistent with contemporary principles of justice and equity. They believed that the Act aligned with Quranic injunctions and aimed to prevent Muslim women from being left destitute after divorce.Secularism: The respondent claimed that the Act did not infringe upon the principles of secularism in the Indian Constitution, as its intent was to protect the fundamental rights of Muslim women. They also argued that the Act did not discriminate against Muslim men since they were still required to provide maintenance to their divorced wives in accordance with Quranic principles.Shah Bano Case JudgmentThe verdict of Shah Bano case was delivered by Chief Justice Y.C. Chandrachud and it resulted in the dismissal of Mohd. Ahmed Khan’s appeal. The Supreme Court ruled that Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure applied to all citizens, irrespective of their religion, without discrimination. The court clarified that Section 125(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure was applicable to Muslims as well. It was emphasised that in case of any conflict between Section 125 and Muslim Personal Law, Section 125 prevailed.The Supreme Court in Shah Bano case concluded that a Muslim husband’s obligation to provide maintenance to a divorced wife who was unable to support herself extended beyond the iddat period, as specified in the Muslim Personal Law. The court expressed that this rule in Muslim Law was inhumane or incorrect because it left a divorced wife in a situation where she couldn’t support herself.The court also stated that the payment of Mehar (a sum paid by the husband on divorce) was not sufficient to absolve him of the responsibility to provide maintenance to his wife.After a thorough legal process, the Supreme Court ultimately ruled in Shah Bano case that a husband’s legal obligation would cease if the divorced wife could support herself. However, this obligation would be reinstated if the wife remained unable to support herself after the iddat period and she would be entitled to receive maintenance or alimony under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.What was the Impact of the Shah Bano Case?The Shah Bano case had a significant impact on the legal landscape, leading to the introduction of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in 1986. While this law aimed to address some of the issues raised by the case, primarily concerning the maintenance of divorced Muslim women, it faced criticism for its limitations.One of the limitations of this Act was that it restricted the maintenance rights of divorced Muslim women. Specifically, it limited the duration for which a Muslim woman was entitled to receive maintenance to the iddat period, which is the period following divorce. In other words, the Act did not extend maintenance rights beyond the iddat period.It’s worth noting that if the Shah Bano case had not taken place, there might have been delays or reluctance in enacting any legal reforms to protect the rights of divorced Muslim women. While the Act aimed to address some issues, its limitations led to ongoing discussions and debates about the rights of Muslim women in India.ConclusionIn Shah Bano case, Shah Bano sought maintenance from her husband under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. This case raised crucial questions about the maintenance of Muslim personal law and the clash between personal laws and a uniform civil code.The Supreme Court ruled in favour of Shah Bano, stating that Section 125 applied to Muslims as well, ensuring maintenance beyond the iddat period. This decision in Shah Bano case led to the enactment of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act in 1986, which faced criticism for limiting maintenance rights. The case significantly impacted the legal landscape and discussions on Muslim women’s rights in India.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Judicial Separation under Hindu Law",
    "data": "                      Judicial Separation under Hindu Law is a legal procedure designed to give troubled couples some time to reflect on their marriage. It allows both the husband and wife to reconsider their relationship while living apart. This legal process provides them with the freedom and space to think about their future and represents their final option for a legal separation.Under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, couples married under this act can seek Judicial Separation by filing a petition. Once the court grants the order for Judicial Separation, they are not required to live together as a married couple.What is Judicial Separation in Hindu Law?In Hindu Law, Judicial Separation is a legal remedy that allows a married couple to live apart without officially dissolving their marriage. It is distinct from divorce and serves as a potential precursor to it. Judicial separation is granted by the court based on specific grounds, such as adultery, cruelty, desertion or other valid reasons recognised by the law.During a judicial separation in Hindu Law, the spouses retain their marital status, but their legal duties and obligations toward each other are suspended. This arrangement provides an opportunity for the couple to assess their relationship, possibly reconcile or eventually move towards divorce. It offers a structured and legally recognised means for couples facing significant marital challenges to obtain a formal separation while remaining legally married.Section 10 of Hindu Marriage Act and Judicial Separation in IndiaJudicial separation under Hindu Law is dealt in Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, which states that;(1) Either party to a marriage, whether solemnised before or after the commencement of this Act, may present a petition praying for a decree for judicial separation on any of the grounds specified in sub-section (1) of section 13 and in the case of a wife also on any of the grounds specified in sub-section (2) thereof, as grounds on which a petition for divorce might have been presented.(2) Where a decree for judicial separation has been passed, it shall no longer be obligatory for the petitioner to cohabit with the respondent, but the court may, on the application by petition of either party and on being satisfied of the truth of the statements made in such petition, rescind the decree if it considers it just and reasonable to do so.Petition for Judicial Separation: Either party in a Hindu marriage, regardless of whether it was solemnised before or after the enactment of the Act, can file a petition seeking a decree for judicial separation. This petition can be based on the grounds specified in Section 13(1) for both parties and on the grounds mentioned in Section 13(2) in the case of a wife. These grounds are the same as those on which a divorce petition could have been filed.Effect of Judicial Separation: Once a decree for judicial separation is granted, it is no longer mandatory for the petitioner and the respondent to live together as a married couple. They can live separately. However, the court has the authority to rescind the decree upon the application of either party if it finds that doing so is just and reasonable.This legal provision provides a structured process for obtaining judicial separation in Hindu marriages and allows for flexibility if circumstances changeFiling Petition for Judicial Separation in IndiaIf one spouse has been harmed by the other, they can initiate a Judicial Separation under Hindu Law petition in a District Court under Section 10 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955. To do so, the following conditions should be met:The marriage between the husband and wife must have been legally solemnised under the Hindu Marriage Act.The respondent, the spouse against whom the petition is filed, should reside within the jurisdiction of the court where the petitioner submits the petition.The husband and wife must have lived together for a specific period before the petition is filed.Every petition should, in accordance with Order VII Rule 1 of the Civil Procedure Code, 1908 contain the following information:The date and place of the marriage.An affidavit confirming that the person is a Hindu.Names, status and addresses of both parties.Names, dates of birth and genders of any children.Details of any prior legal actions filed before seeking a judicial separation or divorce.For judicial separation under Hindu Law, evidence must be provided to substantiate the grounds for the separation.Grounds of Judicial Separation in IndiaGrounds of Judicial Separation under Hindu Law refer to the legal reasons or circumstances under which a married couple can seek a formal separation recognised by the law without proceeding to a full divorce. Judicial separation allows couples to live apart while still legally married. In this section, we will explore various grounds for judicial separation in Hindu Law, examining the situations and criteria that enable either spouse to petition for this legal remedy.AdulteryAdultery refers to when one spouse in a marriage engages in voluntary sexual intercourse with another person outside of the marriage. In the case of Dr. H.T. Vira Reddi v. Kistamma (1968), the Court granted judicial separation under Hindu Law to the husband because the wife had engaged in sexual intercourse with someone else. The Court emphasised that even a single act of infidelity by one spouse is sufficient grounds for obtaining legal separation.CrueltyThe term ‘cruelty’ in the context of marriage doesn’t have the same meaning as in everyday language. ‘Legal cruelty’ has a different definition. In the case of G.V.N. Kaeswara Rao v. G. Jalli (2002), the Supreme Court attempted to define ‘cruelty’ within the context of marriage.The Court stated that an act is considered cruel if its intent is to cause suffering to the other spouse. It doesn’t necessarily have to create fear in the spouse that it’s dangerous to live with the other. The intent of the person causing the cruelty doesn’t matter and it doesn’t have to be committed by the respondent alone.DesertionDesertion, for a continuous period of two years, can be a basis for seeking judicial separation under Hindu Law. It means one spouse completely abandoning their marital responsibilities without a valid reason and without the consent of the other spouse. There are three types of desertion:Actual desertion: When one spouse physically abandons the other without explanation. For instance, in the case of Meena v. Lachman (1959), the wife left for her parent’s home without informing her husband and made false promises of return but didn’t come back for two years. The Bombay High Court recognised this as desertion and granted judicial separation in Hindu Law.Constructive Desertion: Constructive desertion occurs when one spouse creates an environment that compels the other spouse to leave. In the case of Jyotish Chandra Guha v. Meera Guha (1969), the husband’s persistent disinterest and cold, rude behaviour towards his wife led to her enduring mental and physical suffering. She was eventually forced to file a divorce petition. The court deemed this as desertion at the hands of the husband.Wilful NeglectWilful neglect happens when one spouse intentionally neglects their marital duties towards the other without physically leaving. This may involve a refusal to cohabit or a failure to fulfil various marital responsibilities.ConversionIf one spouse converts to another religion, ceasing to be a Hindu, the other party can seek judicial separation under Hindu Law. In the case of Vilayat Raj v. Smt. Sunila (1983), where the husband converted to Islam and sought to dissolve the marriage, the court established that a conversion alone does not automatically end the marriage but serves as a ground for its dissolution. However, the court also noted that a party cannot benefit from a situation they created to the detriment of the other spouse.Unsound Mind or Mental DisorderIf one spouse is of unsound mind or suffers from an incurable mental illness or disorder that makes it difficult for the other spouse to live with them, an appeal for judicial separation in India can be filed. In the case of Anima Roy v. Proboth Mohan Roy (1968), the husband sought nullity of the marriage, claiming his wife had schizophrenia at the time of their marriage. However, his petition was not allowed by the court due to an unwarranted delay of three years in filing the petition from the date he claimed to have learned about his wife’s condition. Additionally, the evidence presented was not satisfactory.Venereal Communicable DiseasesIf one spouse suffers from a communicable and incurable venereal disease such as HIV/AIDS, HPV or syphilis, the other spouse can seek judicial separation under Hindu Law. In the case of Madhusudan v. Smt. Chandrika (1975), the husband filed a petition seeking annulment of the marriage or judicial separation due to his wife’s syphilis. The court rejected his appeal because he couldn’t prove that his wife had syphilis for three years before the petition and the incurable nature of the disease was not established.RenunciationRenunciation occurs when a person forsakes worldly pleasures to lead a spiritual life and seek enlightenment. This is one of the grounds on which a party to a marriage can request judicial separation. In the case of Teesta Chattoraj vs. Union of India (2012), ‘renounce the world’ was defined as withdrawing from worldly interests to lead a spiritual life. It involves formally consenting to abandon or surrender material possessions and worldly claims.Presumption of Not Being AliveIf one spouse goes missing for a minimum of seven years and there is no information about their status and their family and friends are unaware of their whereabouts, it is presumed that the missing spouse may have passed away. In such cases, the other spouse can request judicial separation on these grounds.Grounds of Judicial Separation Available to the WifeBigamyBigamy refers to marrying another person when one is already legally married to someone else. Prior to the commencement of the Act, if a husband remarried another woman while his wife was still alive, the wife could file a petition for judicial separation under Hindu Law. In the case of Harmohan Senapati v. Smt. Kamala Kumari (1978), the wife filed a suit for judicial separation because the husband married another woman and lived with her without dissolving their earlier marriage.Guilty of Rape, Sodomy or BestialityIf the husband, after marriage, is found guilty of rape, sodomy or bestiality, the wife has the right to file a petition for judicial separation on these grounds. For example, if ‘A’ and ‘B’ are husband and wife and ‘A’ is convicted of rape of another woman, ‘B’ can file a petition for judicial separation under Hindu Law.Non-Resumption of Cohabitation After an Order of MaintenanceIf a decree or order has been passed against the husband to provide maintenance to the wife under various acts like the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act, 1956 or under Section 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 and no cohabitation between the husband and wife has resumed for a period of one year or more, the wife can file a petition for judicial separation.Repudiation of Marriage After the Age of 15 and Before the Age of 18If a marriage was solemnised when the girl was under 15 years of age and she repudiates the marriage after turning 15 but before turning 18, the wife can file a petition for judicial separation under Hindu Law. This ground is significant in providing relief to minor girls, especially from disadvantaged communities, who were married against their will.Effect of Judicial Separation in Hindu LawThe effect of judicial separation in Hindu Law is a formal legal recognition of a married couple living apart without dissolving the marriage. During a judicial separation, both parties retain their marital status, but their legal obligations to each other are suspended. They are no longer required to cohabit and the court may even decide on issues like financial support and child custody. While the marriage still exists in name, the couple can essentially lead separate lives.This arrangement offers the opportunity for the couple to evaluate their relationship, potentially reconcile or eventually seek a divorce. The effect of judicial separation under Hindu Law provides a structured and legally recognised means for couples facing insurmountable marital challenges to obtain a formal separation while maintaining their legal marriage status.ConclusionJudicial Separation under Hindu Law is a legal mechanism designed to provide relief for married couples facing insurmountable challenges in their relationship. It allows spouses to live apart while maintaining their legal marital status.The various grounds for judicial separation, ranging from adultery to cruelty and more, offer individuals recourse to address specific issues within their marriage. It serves as a significant step before divorce, allowing couples to evaluate their relationship, seek reconciliation or move towards a more permanent separation.By providing a structured and recognised path for marital separation, Hindu Law seeks to balance the institution of marriage with individual rights and the need for solutions when the marital bond becomes untenable, ultimately promoting fairness and justice within the context of family law.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "DK Basu vs State of West Bengal",
    "data": "                      The DK Basu vs State of West Bengal case is widely considered a landmark in criminal jurisprudence. The guidelines established in DK Basu vs State of West Bengal were later integrated into the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, through the Code of Criminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2008, effective from November 1, 2010.Before the DK Basu case, custodial violence and deaths were not uncommon and although compensation was occasionally awarded, there were no specific provisions or rules to hold parties accountable for such incidents. The case emerged as a crucial response to address the pressing issue of custodial deaths and violence. It marked the beginning of holding the police liable for their actions in custody.While there has been a reduction in custodial deaths and violence following this case, these issues have not been entirely eradicated. Some of the guidelines outlined in the case remain more of theoretical regulations on paper rather than consistently enforced practices in reality.Facts of DK Basu vs State of West BengalDK Basu served as the Executive Chairman of Legal Aid Services in West Bengal, a non-political organisation. He wrote a letter to the Supreme Court of India, bringing to its attention news reports about deaths in police custody and lockups. In the letter, he highlighted that such cases of custodial violence often went unpunished, despite efforts made to address the issue.He urged the court to investigate this matter and provide compensation to the families of the victims. He requested that the letter be treated as a Writ Petition under the category of “Public Interest Litigation.” Recognising the importance of the issues raised in the letter, the court treated it as a formal petition and the defendants were notified.Issues RaisedThe issues raised in DK Basu versus State of West Bengal were:Is there an increase in cases of custodial deaths and violence?Is there a need for guidelines governing the arrest and custody of detainees?Should police officers be held responsible for custodial deaths and violence?Does custodial death and violence constitute a violation of Article 21 of the detainees’ rights?Arguments from the PetitionerThe petitioner argued in DK Basu vs State of West Bengal that the physical and mental suffering experienced by detainees within police stations or confinement facilities should be prevented. Whether it involves physical assault or rape in police custody, the trauma endured extends beyond what the law currently addresses.The petitioner further contended in DK Basu case that, as a civilised nation, significant steps should be taken to eliminate such practices.Arguments from the RespondentCounsel representing different states and Dr. A.M. Singhvi asserted in DK Basu v State of West Bengal that everything was already well-established within their respective states. They presented their beliefs and provided valuable assistance to the court in examining various aspects of the issue.They also made suggestions for the court to establish guidelines aimed at reducing, if not preventing, custodial violence and providing support to the relatives of those who die in custody due to torture.Judgment of DK Basu vs State of West BengalThe Supreme Court, in DK Basu vs State of West Bengal referring to the case of Neelabati Bahera v. State of Orissa (AIR 1993 SC 1960), reiterated that prisoners and detainees should not be deprived of their Fundamental Rights under Article 21. Only legally permissible restrictions can be imposed on the enjoyment of their Fundamental Rights.DK Basu GuidelinesIn light of this, the Apex Court laid down the following guidelines for the arrest and detention of individuals:DK Basu vs State of West Bengal SummaryThe DK Basu case is a landmark in Indian criminal jurisprudence. It established guidelines to protect the rights and dignity of individuals in police custody. The Supreme Court emphasised the need for visible identification of police officers, the preparation of an arrest memo and the right of the detainee to have a friend or relative informed about their arrest.The DK Basu versus State of West Bengal case led to the inclusion of these guidelines in the Criminal Procedure Code in 2008. While it has helped reduce custodial deaths and violence, challenges in enforcement remain, making it essential to ensure that these safeguards are consistently applied to protect the rights and well-being of those in custody.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Section 354D IPC",
    "data": "                      Section 354D of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) deals with the offence of stalking. Stalking, which involves persistent and unwanted attention, monitoring, or contact with another person, primarily targets women and is recognised as a criminal offence in order to safeguard their safety and dignity.This article provides a detailed legal analysis of Section 354D of the IPC, discussing its provisions, exceptions and penalties.Section 354D of the IPCSection 354 of the IPC states:(1) Any man who—(i) follows a woman and contacts, or attempts to contact such woman to foster personal interaction repeatedly despite a clear indication of disinterest by such woman; or(ii) monitors the use by a woman of the internet, email or any other form of electronic communication,commits the offence of stalking;Provided that such conduct shall not amount to stalking if the man who pursued it proves that—(i) it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting crime and the man accused of stalking had been entrusted with the responsibility of prevention and detection of crime by the State; or(ii) it was pursued under any law or to comply with any condition or requirement imposed by any person under any law; or(iii) in the particular circumstances such conduct was reasonable and justified.(2) Whoever commits the offence of stalking shall be punished on the first conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years and shall also be liable to fine; and be punished on a second or subsequent conviction, with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to five years and shall also be liable to fine.Section 354D IPC: ProvisionsDefinition of StalkingThe first subsection of Section 354D defines stalking. It states that any man who does the following can be charged with the offence of stalking:(i) Follows a Woman: This involves pursuing a woman physically, shadowing her movements, or keeping a watch on her in person.(ii) Contacts or Attempts to Contact Repeatedly: The man repeatedly tries to communicate with the woman. This communication can be in the form of calls, messages, or other means.Clear Indication of DisinterestThe act of stalking should take place despite a clear indication of disinterest from the woman. It is essential that the woman has expressed her lack of interest explicitly and the man continues to engage in stalking activities.Proviso to Section 354D(1)Section 354D(1) provides certain exceptions, stating that stalking does not apply if the following conditions are met:(i) Purpose of Preventing or Detecting Crime: Stalking will not be considered an offence if the man can prove that it was pursued for the purpose of preventing or detecting a crime and he had been entrusted with the responsibility of crime prevention and detection by the State. This exception acknowledges that certain law enforcement officers or individuals may need to monitor certain individuals as part of their job.(ii) Compliance with Laws or Conditions: If the act of stalking is undertaken to comply with any law or a condition imposed by a person under any law, it will not be considered an offence.(iii) Reasonable and Justified Circumstances: Stalking may not be considered an offence if it can be shown that, in the particular circumstances, such conduct was reasonable and justified. This allows for flexibility in certain situations where stalking may be necessary for legitimate reasons.PenaltiesFirst Conviction: Upon the first conviction for stalking, the offender may be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term that may extend to three years, in addition to a fine.Second or Subsequent Convictions: In case of a second or subsequent conviction, the offender may be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term that may extend to five years, along with a fine.Essentials of Section 354D IPCThe essentials of the offence of stalking under Section 354D of the Indian Penal Code require specific elements to be established for a violation to occur. These elements of Section 354D of the IPC include:Perpetrator’s Gender: Stalking must be committed by any man. The offence is gender-specific, meaning it involves a man as the perpetrator and a woman as the victim.Unwanted Contact: The man must try to contact or contact a woman against her interest. This element involves any form of communication, be it in person or through electronic means, where the woman has expressed disinterest and the man persists in trying to establish contact.Repetition: The act of stalking must exhibit a certain degree of repeatedness. It’s not a one-time occurrence but rather involves a pattern of persistent and unwanted attention or contact. This pattern is essential to distinguish stalking from isolated or accidental interactions.Absence of Interest: There should be a clear indication of disinterest on the part of the woman. This element is crucial to ensure that the woman’s lack of consent or interest is evident and that the man is persisting despite her objections.Modes of Stalking under Section 354D IPCStalking can manifest in various forms and techniques. While there isn’t a single style that constitutes stalking as a crime, it can include any of the following behaviours:Tracking the Victim: This involves following the victim’s movements, either physically or through surveillance methods, to monitor their activities.Sending Offensive Messages: Stalkers may send offensive or threatening messages, which can be in the form of text messages, emails, or any other electronic means of communication.Coercive Attempts to Communicate: Stalkers may use various methods to coerce the victim into communicating with them, which could include threats or manipulation.Unauthorised Photography: Taking pictures of the victim without her consent is a form of invasion of privacy and can be considered part of stalking behaviour.Physical Assault, Sexual Assault Threats and Violence: Stalkers may resort to physical assault, sexual assault threats, or the threat of physical violence to intimidate and control the victim.Loitering Near Victim’s Residence: Stalkers may stand outside the victim’s house or workplace, making unnecessary visits or presence as a means of intimidation or harassment.Use of Social Media and Apps: With the advent of technology, stalkers can use social media platforms and various apps to stalk their victims, such as sending messages, tracking locations, or monitoring online activities.Section 354D IPC: Legal AnalysisThe legal implications of Section 354D are crucial for understanding the protection it offers to women and the consequences for those found guilty of stalking. It emphasises the following key points:Protection for Women: Section 354D is a significant step towards safeguarding the rights and dignity of women. It recognises the detrimental impact of stalking on victims and provides a legal framework to address this issue.Exceptions for Law Enforcement: The law acknowledges that certain professionals, such as law enforcement officers, may need to engage in activities that resemble stalking in the course of their duties. This provision ensures that legitimate crime prevention and detection efforts are not penalised.Balancing Rights: The law allows for the defence of reasonable and justified circumstances, which ensures that the rights of the accused are also considered. This provision helps maintain a balance between protecting women from harassment and respecting individual rights.Strict Penalties: The law imposes stringent penalties, especially for repeat offenders, to deter individuals from engaging in stalking behaviour. These penalties include both imprisonment and fines, emphasising the seriousness of the offence.Section 354D IPC Case LawsShri Deu Baju Bodake v. The State of Maharashtra (2016)In this case, the Bombay High Court dealt with the tragic death of a woman due to ongoing harassment and stalking by the accused. The victim was relentlessly pursued and stalked by the offender, even during her work, despite her clear resistance and lack of interest. The High Court emphasised the importance of invoking Section 354D of the IPC in conjunction with abetment to suicide to hold the guilty accountable.Madhya Pradesh High Court’s Single Judge Bench Case (2023)In a recent judgment, a single judge of the Madhya Pradesh High Court refused a bail application for an 18-year-old boy accused of stalking. The court observed that some crimes are driven by financial gain, while others, like stalking, seek psychological gratification. The petitioner in this case had persistently stalked a 16-year-old girl with the aim of deriving mental satisfaction.Stalking, voyeurism and following the victim not only cause severe embarrassment and harassment but also undermine the victim’s self-esteem. This is especially pertinent in societies with feudalistic norms, where the perpetrator considers his actions a form of conquest, sending a disturbing message to the community.Santosh Kumar Singh v. State Through CBI (2010)This infamous case revolved around the stalking, rape and murder of Priyadarshini Mattoo, a 25-year-old law student, in New Delhi. The accused, Santosh Singh, a senior student at the Delhi campus law centre and the son of a former IPS officer, had subjected the victim to relentless stalking, harassment, threats and lewd demands. The case triggered the application of Section 354D of the IPC.After an FIR was filed under Section 354, the accused was granted bail. The situation escalated to such an extent that the university’s dean intervened, instructing the accused to cease his reprehensible behaviour and providing personal protection to the victim. Tragically, the victim was attacked and killed while home alone, leading to a highly complex legal battle. The accused was initially sentenced to death, but the Supreme Court later commuted the punishment to life imprisonment, citing issues with evidence fabrication and legal processes.Inspector General of Police v. S. Samuthiram (2012)This case underscores the significance of addressing complaints by victims and onlookers concerning incidents of evening taunting and harassment in public spaces, including transit systems, schools, theatres and other locations.Kalandi Charan Lenka v. State of Orissa (2017)In this case, the informant, a student at Pattamundai’s Women’s College, reported indecent remarks and harassment she experienced at school. Her father had also received pornographic messages from an unidentified number, which adversely impacted the family’s reputation. The High Court ruled that the accused was prima facie liable for sexual harassment, leading to the denial of the bail application. The case highlights the importance of addressing such incidents and taking appropriate legal action to protect victim.Exceptions to Stalking Under Section 354D of the IPCSection 354D of the Indian Penal Code addresses the offence of stalking, but it also provides certain exceptions that prevent specific actions from being considered as stalking under the law. These exceptions include:Responsibility to the State for Crime Prevention or Detection: Stalking does not constitute an offence if a man is pursuing a woman as part of his official duty or responsibility to the state to detect or prevent a crime. In such cases, the man’s actions may be justified if they are undertaken in the interest of law enforcement and public safety.Compliance with Authorised Conditions or Laws: Stalking is not an offence if a man is engaging in such conduct as a requirement or condition imposed by a person authorised by law. This exception acknowledges that certain lawful obligations or conditions may necessitate monitoring or interaction with an individual.Reasonable and Justifiable Circumstances: Stalking may not be considered an offence if the man can demonstrate that, in the specific circumstances, his conduct was reasonable and justified. This exception allows for flexibility in cases where the actions taken by the man may be considered reasonable and justifiable under the given circumstances.It’s important to note that these exceptions are intended to prevent the misuse of the law in situations where actions may have a legitimate purpose. However, the burden of proof lies with the accused to establish that their actions fall within one of these exceptions.Punishment for Stalking under Section 354D of the IPCUnder Section 354D of the IPC, the penalties for stalking are as follows:First Conviction: Upon the first conviction for stalking, the offender may be punished with simple or grievous imprisonment for a term that may extend to three years and is also liable to pay a fine.Second or Subsequent Convictions: In the case of a second or subsequent conviction for stalking, the offender may be punished with simple or grievous imprisonment for a term that may extend to five years and shall also be liable to pay a fine.These penalties are designed to deter individuals from engaging in stalking behaviour and to protect the rights and dignity of women by providing legal consequences for those found guilty of the offence.ConclusionSection 354D of the Indian Penal Code is a significant legal provision aimed at protecting women from the offence of stalking. It defines stalking, provides exceptions for certain circumstances and imposes penalties on those found guilty.Understanding this section is vital for both women seeking protection from stalking and individuals seeking to avoid wrongful accusations, especially in the age of technological advancements and increased connectivity.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib",
    "data": "                      The case of Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib, (1981) 1 SCC 722, was a significant ruling by the Supreme Court of India. In this case, the Court established a test to figure out if an individual, corporation, or society could be considered an instrumentality or agency of the government. This determination is important because it decides whether they can be treated as a “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution of India. When an entity is regarded as a “State” under Article 12, it can be subject to a writ petition if it violates the Constitution.The Court’s decision, which Justice P. N. Bhagwati presented, essentially summarised Bhagwati’s perspective in the case of R. D. Shetty v International Airport Authority of India. Ajay Hasia condensed the International Airport Authority case into a six-factor test for identifying whether an entity qualifies as an instrumentality or agency of the State.Facts of Ajay Hasia v Khalid MujibAjay Hasia v Khalid Mujib involves the Regional Engineering College in Srinagar, which is one of 15 colleges in the Union Territory of Jammu and Kashmir. These colleges are registered and managed as “societies” under government oversight. They are registered under the J&K Registration of Societies Act of 1898. The government has direct or indirect control over the management and administrative functions of these colleges. The funding for these colleges comes from both the central government and the J&K state government. Faculty and staff recruitment for the college are typically carried out by government representatives and many faculty members are government appointees themselves.The current situation arises from a writ petition filed by the petitioners, who seek to invoke Article 32 against the college authorities on the grounds that the college falls under the definition of “the state.” The petitioners applied for admission to the B.E. Course at the college in response to a notice issued by the college authorities regarding available admission vacancies. However, they argue that the admission process and the subsequent results lack validity. The procedure included a qualifying examination worth 100 marks and a viva voce examination (an oral examination) worth 50 marks. The petitioners claim that this process was unfairly implemented to their disadvantage.The petitioners allege that the college authorities determined the results of both the qualifying examination and the viva voce examination unjustly. They contend that they scored higher marks in the qualifying examination compared to the applicants who were admitted solely on the basis of the viva voce examination, which accounts for almost 50% of the total evaluation. The viva voce examination, which lasted only 2 or 3 minutes, consisted of questions unrelated to the course and, in the petitioners’ view, cannot be considered a reliable test for determining admissions. This has raised questions about the maintainability of the petitioners’ claims and the reliability of the admission procedure.Legal Provisions ReferredThis case revolves around the admission process at the Regional Engineering College in Srinagar, Jammu & Kashmir, which is registered as a society under the Jammu & Kashmir Registration of Societies Act, 1898. The main issue in question is whether this college qualifies as a “State” under Article 12 of the Constitution of India and, as a result, is subject to writ jurisdiction.The admission procedure involved conducting viva voce interviews, where each candidate was interviewed for a very short duration, typically lasting only two or three minutes. The questions asked during these interviews were merely formal and related to the candidate’s background and residence. These questions had no relevance to the subject for which marks were allocated. The key question is whether this viva voce process was arbitrary.Additionally, 1/3 of the total marks were allocated to the viva voce examination and this allocation is being questioned as potentially bad, unreasonable and arbitrary.Another issue raised in this case is whether the practice of prescribing different admission procedures for candidates from Jammu & Kashmir and candidates from other states violates the Equality Clause under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.Issues RaisedThe issues raised in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib were:Arguments Made by the PetitionerIn the case of Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib, the petitioners aimed to challenge the classification of the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, asserting that it should indeed be regarded as a ‘State’ within the meaning of Article 12 of the Indian Constitution.The primary argument presented by the petitioners in Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib was that, despite being officially registered as a society, the college essentially functioned as a governmental entity. They argued that the college’s establishment was a result of government initiatives and a significant portion of its funding came from the Governments of India and Jammu and Kashmir.Furthermore, the petitioners pointed to the composition of the Board of Governors as evidence of government control over the college. The Board was predominantly composed of government appointees, including representatives from various government bodies and officials appointed by the two governments. This, they contended, demonstrated that the college was not merely a passive recipient of government funds but was directly under government control.According to the petitioners in Ajay Hasia vs Khalid Mujib, the genuine nature and character of the college were governmental in nature, thus categorising it as a ‘State’ under Article 12. They argued that the formal registration of the college as a society under the Jammu and Kashmir Registration of Societies Act, 1898, should not alter the core essence of the institution. They maintained that the court should delve beyond the legal form and take into consideration the actual operations and control of the college, which, in their view, fell firmly within the scope of governmental authority.Arguments Made by the RespondentsIn contrast, the Respondents in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib put forth the argument that the Regional Engineering College, Srinagar, should not be classified as a ‘State’ under Article 12. Their primary contention was based on the formal legal status of the college. They maintained that, despite substantial government influence, the college was officially registered as a society and, therefore, should not be considered a government entity.The Respondents acknowledged that the government played a pivotal role in establishing the college, provided significant funding and had government appointees on the Board of Governors. However, they argued that the college functioned as an autonomous entity. They contended that the link between the college and the government was more in name than in substance and did not transform the college into a ‘State’.Furthermore, the Respondents in Ajay Hasia versus Khalid Mujib highlighted that the college had its own set of rules and regulations and was not directly bound by government rules. They also emphasised that the college had a degree of flexibility in its operations and was not under the government’s direct control in its day-to-day activities.Therefore, the core of the Respondents’ argument was that the college’s formal registration as a society and its operational autonomy set it apart from a government body, thereby excluding it from the scope of ‘State’ under Article 12. They urged the court to consider the legal form of the college and its self-governing nature, asserting that the level of government influence was insufficient to classify the college as a ‘State’.Judgement in Ajay Hasia v Khalid MujibIssue 1The court in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib ruled in favour of the petitioners on the first issue, affirming that the present writ petition was legally maintainable because the Regional Engineering College fell within the scope of Article 12 under the category of “other authorities.”In their analysis, the court examined various clauses within the memorandum of understanding and rules of conduct governing the registered college authority. They highlighted that the composition of the Society was predominantly influenced by delegates chosen by the Central Government and the governments of Jammu and Kashmir, Punjab, Rajasthan and Uttar Pradesh, with the Central Government’s agreement. The financial resources required to operate the college were provided entirely by the Central Government and the Government of Jammu and Kashmir. The Society could only secure additional funds with the concurrence of both the State and Central Governments. Furthermore, the rules of the Society needed approval at both government levels.Taking into consideration the arguments presented by the petitioners and analysing them in the context of how the college operated under the overall control of the government, the court in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib concluded that the Regional Engineering College, as a registered society, could be considered a “State” under Article 12 and thus the present writ petition was maintainable. They emphasised that it did not matter whether the corporation was established by legislation or statute for this purpose; what mattered was whether it acted as a government instrumentality or agency. The key question was not how the juristic person came into existence but why it was created.Furthermore, the court laid out a test to determine whether an entity falls within the category of an instrumentality or agency of the state under Article 12:If the government owns the entire share capital of the body, it strongly suggests that the body is an instrument of the government.When the government provides financial aid that covers nearly all of the body’s expenses, it may imply that the body possesses a governmental character.It’s a relevant factor if the body has a monopoly status granted or protected by the state.The presence of profound and widespread state control may indicate that the body is a state instrument.If the body’s functions are of public importance and closely connected to governmental functions, it is a relevant factor to consider the body as an instrumentality of the government.Issue 2On the second issue, the court’s ruling in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib leaned slightly in favour of the respondents but maintained a lawful and impartial stance. The bench laid down specific guidelines to determine whether the selection procedure violated Article 14 of the Indian Constitution.The court provided justifications for its order, taking into account the evidence presented. It emphasised that it’s well established that a state authority or institution has the discretion to establish its own selection procedures without rigid restrictions. In this case, the college acted correctly by conducting both exams and there was no clear evidence of bias. However, the court found that allocating 50 out of 150 marks to the viva voce examination was excessive and should be reviewed for future admission tests at the college. The court also noted that the current admissions of students should not be reversed, as it would be unfair to those who were admitted and the petitioners should not be allowed to gain admission benefits solely on the suspicion of bias by the respondents.Regarding the violation of Article 14, the court in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib closely examined the distinction between the doctrine of classification and Article 14. It explained that the mere classification or ranking of things by hierarchy or value does not necessarily imply unequal or unjust treatment under Article 14 of the Indian Constitution. The court also dismissed the petitioners’ argument that interview rounds were unsuitable for assessing a person’s suitability for a position, stating that oral interviews are an integral part of the Indian selection process, as long as they are conducted fairly.The court found no concrete evidence to support the petitioners’ claim that the viva voce examination was too brief or irrelevant. The respondents clarified that the average interview time was 4 to 5 minutes and candidates were appropriately assessed for their suitability for the course. The court concluded that the potential for interviews to be abused or manipulated is not a sufficient reason to eliminate them from the selection procedure.However, the court in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib issued overall guidelines to prevent future discrepancies. It directed the college to review its selection procedure, with the viva voce examination holding a smaller proportion of the total marks allocated.Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib SummaryJustice P. N. Bhagwati delivered the Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujib judgment and it’s most notably known for introducing the summarised six-factor test. This test has become influential and is frequently cited, even more so than the previous International Airport Authority case, also authored by Justice Bhagwati.The six factors in this test in Ajay Hasia v Khalid Mujibare as follows:Whether the share-capital of the corporation is held by the Government.Whether the financial assistance from the State covers nearly all the corporation’s expenses.Whether the corporation enjoys a monopoly status granted or protected by the state.Whether there is significant and extensive state control over the corporation.Whether the functions of the corporation are of public importance and closely linked to governmental functions.Whether a department of the government has been transferred to the corporation.These factors serve as a guideline to determine whether an entity can be regarded as an instrumentality or agency of the state and, therefore, subject to the provisions of Article 12 of the Indian Constitution.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

It has been one of the most exciting and controversial ideas. It has been debated on at least three fronts. In the first place, in terms of what constitutes justice.As a second point, the concept of justice has been affected by normative evaluations; accordingly, various explanations of justice have been predisposed to the normative impetuses of the commentators.Third, the topic of what constitutes justice has been at the centre of the debate over good laws. An analytical breadth has been reached on the question of what are excellent laws when justice at the practical level is always given according to the law.Every society’s definition of justice has evolved through time. In India,societies evolved an understanding of justice throughout the past from the evolution of the conception of justice as unequal castes, genders and communitiesin pre-modern timesto ideas of justice based on English Legal Principles in modern times; and justice as expanding capacities in post-modern times.Political ideologies, religious beliefs, cultural intolerance, poverty and hunger, gender discrimination, abuses of human rights, and inequality, among other social handicaps, have prevented common people’s accessto justice even since independence.The theme is “Tracing the Idea of Justice from the Pre-Independence period to the 75th year of India’s Independence”.

Justice Ajit Kumar set aside a State government’s decision to cut the pay of an employee who suffered paralysis, deeming it a violation of disability rights.The court criticized the State for denying payments to the deceased employee’s family and ordered arrears, along with 8% interest, and imposed a ₹25,000 cost on the State government. The judgment emphasizes the supremacy of the disability act over state rules.Supreme Court Urges Delimitation Commission Revival for SC/ST RepresentationThe Supreme Court, led by CJI DY Chandrachud, advocates for the reconstitution of the Delimitation Commission to ensure proportional representation of Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) in state assemblies.

The Court will resume the hearing on Thursday.Important Legal News | 20 NovemberPlea in Supreme Court Challenges Exclusion of Adults with Learning Disabilities from Disability Certification Under RPwD ActA final-year PhD student at Jawaharlal Nehru University has filed a plea in the Supreme Court challenging guidelines under the RPwD Act that exclude adults with specific learning disabilities (SLDs) from receiving disability certificates.

The Delhi High Court, led by Acting Chief Justice Manmohan and Justice Mini Pushkarna, grants the Central government time to respond, setting the hearing for November 28.The plea argues that the retrospective mandate for CLAT PG in the 33rd course of JAG entry is arbitrary and violates constitutional articles. The PIL also questions criteria such as marital status and arrest records. The court had previously questioned the correlation between marital status and JAG training in December 2022.Important Legal News | 18 NovemberSupreme Court to Deliberate on Legal Impact: Can Subsequent Law Changes Challenge Acquittals?The Supreme Court is set to decide whether a change in law can be a valid basis for challenging acquittals. This follows a Kerala High Court case where an appeal against acquittal under NDPS Act was admitted after a delay of 1184 days. The High Court, noting a change in law from Mohanlal to Mukesh Singh, condoned the delay, prompting an appeal. The accused contends that a subsequent legal change should not justify delay condonation. The Supreme Court has issued a notice, staying proceedings for six weeks. The case underscores the evolving legal stance on investigatory roles and fair trials.Punjab and Haryana High Court Strikes Down Haryana’s 75% Domicile Reservation in Private JobsThe Punjab and Haryana High Court declared Haryana’s State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, unconstitutional.

The court emphasised that state powers should not compromise national interests and rejected the idea of forcing private employers to hire locally. The ruling highlighted that the state exceeded its authority by legislating on hiring practices. The decision underlined constitutional values, condemning discrimination based on birthplace and residence. The court reaffirmed the importance of constitutional morality and upheld the oneness of India.Supreme Court: Writ Petition Not Maintainable Against Facilitation Council’s Award under MSMED ActIn a recent ruling, the Supreme Court declared that filing a writ petition against an award issued by a Facilitation Council under the Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises Development (MSMED) Act, 2006 is not maintainable. The bench, led by CJI DY Chandrachud, clarified that Section 34 of the Act provides the appropriate remedy against such awards.

The scheme aims to address pervasive discrimination, promoting hope and progress.Telangana High Court Emphasises Clarification in Minor Rape CasesTelangana High Court has ruled that in rape cases involving minors, the trial court must seek clarification from the victim when there’s no corroborative evidence. The court stressed that the use of the word ‘rape’ by a child victim, without supporting evidence, cannot solely establish penetrative sexual assault. Justice K Surender highlighted the importance of understanding the child’s interpretation of ‘rape’ under POCSO Act. The judgment overturned a conviction under aggravated penetrative sexual assault, instead convicting the accused under sexual assault, citing insufficient evidence. The ruling underscores the need for cautious consideration in such cases, recognising potential life-altering consequences.Kerala High Court Mandates Swift Staff Appointments at Lok AdalatThe Kerala High Court has instructed the Kerala State Legal Services Authority (KELSA) to promptly fill five sanctioned vacancies at the Permanent Lok Adalat (PLA) in Ernakulam.

The decision aims to address the functional challenges at PLA, ensuring timely resolution of cases, including one concerning an insurance claim. The ruling underscores the court’s commitment to maintaining the effectiveness of Lok Adalats.Important Legal News | 15 NovemberHimachal Pradesh High Court Declares Failure to Report POCSO Offences as BailableSummary: The Himachal Pradesh High Court has ruled that failure to report crimes under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO) is now a bailable offence. Section 21 of POCSO penalizes non-reporting of child sexual abuse offences, with potential imprisonment up to six months or a year. Justice Rakesh Kainthla clarified that, according to the Code of Criminal Procedure, this offence is bailable. The court’s decision arose from a petition for anticipatory bail by a man accused of not reporting a crime in his hotel. The ruling aligns with similar stances taken by Kerala and Karnataka High Courts on the matter.Supreme Court Affirms: Agreement to Sell Doesn’t Transfer OwnershipThe Supreme Court clarified that an “agreement to sell” does not confer ownership or title, emphasizing it is not a conveyance. The ruling arose from a property dispute where a 1990 agreement faced execution issues. The key question was whether it violated the Karnataka Prevention of Fragmentation and Consolidation of Holdings Act.Despite a 2008 appellate court ruling in favor of the purchaser, the Karnataka High Court deemed the agreement void in 2011. The Supreme Court disagreed, stating the agreement wasn’t in violation and, since filed post-law repeal, the suit wasn’t time-barred. The decision favors the purchaser, restoring the initial appellate court’s ruling.Chhattisgarh High Court: Abusing Wife in Front of Students Equals Mental CrueltyThe Chhattisgarh High Court granted a woman’s plea for divorce, ruling that a husband verbally abusing his teacher wife in front of her students constitutes mental cruelty under the Hindu Marriage Act. Justices Goutam Bhaduri and Deepak Kumar Tiwari stated that such actions not only tarnish the wife’s image but also risk students losing respect for their teacher. The court emphasized the husband’s failure to provide evidence against the wife’s claims of character assassination and job interference. The decision, based on the wife’s proof of mental and physical cruelty, overturned a Family Court judgment from November 2021.Note: No important legal news is available from 11th to 14th November on the occasion of Diwali!Important Legal News | 10 NovemberSupreme Court Rejects PIL for Cryptocurrency Regulation, Advises Alternative AvenuesThe Supreme Court dismissed a PIL seeking cryptocurrency regulation, stating the issue falls within the legislative domain. Chief Justice DY Chandrachud noted the petitioner’s underlying motive seemed to secure bail in a related case. The Court emphasized the petitioner could seek remedies through other authorities.The petitioner argued that cryptocurrency transactions were voluntary and not an offence under the Indian Penal Code, but the Court declined further consideration. The petitioner, Manu Prashant Wig, currently in judicial custody for an alleged investment scheme, faces accusations of inducing investments with a high return rate. The Court directed the petitioner to explore other forums for relief.Important Legal News | 09 NovemberSupreme Court Reaches Full Capacity with Swearing-In of Three New JudgesThree newly appointed justices—Satish Chandra Sharma, Augustine George Masih and Sandeep Mehta—were sworn in, marking the Supreme Court of India’s attainment of its full sanctioned strength of 34 judges. Their nominations were cleared by the government, following the Supreme Court Collegium’s proposal on November 6. The appointments aimed to address the mounting workload caused by a substantial backlog of cases. Each judge brings extensive judicial experience, having previously served as Chief Justices in various High Courts. Justice Sharma, for instance, held roles in Telangana and Delhi, ranking high in seniority. The Collegium highlighted Justice Masih’s expertise in diverse legal fields, while Justice Mehta previously served in the Gauhati High Court. Their diverse backgrounds and expertise were considered in their elevation to this crucial national judicial body.Supreme Court Affirms Constitutionality of IBC Provisions for Personal Guarantors Without Adjudicatory RoleThe Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC) provisions concerning Personal Guarantors’ Insolvency Resolution. Justices, led by CJI DY Chandrachud, rejected claims of unconstitutionality, emphasising that sections from 95 to 100 of the IBC are not in violation of Article 14 of the Constitution. The court declined to introduce an opportunity for hearing into these provisions, citing that such a move would alter the legislated functions. It highlighted that the Resolution Professional’s role is recommendatory, with the true adjudication commencing at Section 100 after the submission of the report. The decision emphasised distinct treatment between corporate and individual insolvency. The judgment also underscored that moratorium under Section 96 serves to protect the corporate debtor from legal actions related to the debt. The Court’s ruling underscored that the Resolution Professional’s function is facilitative, not adjudicatory, ensuring fairness and procedural checks within the IBC framework.Supreme Court Reaffirms 4 Crucial Circumstances in Poison-Related MurdersIn a recent judgment, the Supreme Court cleared an accused in a two-decade-old case involving alleged liquor poisoning, reiterating the importance of proving specific circumstances in poison-related murders. Drawing from the 1984 case of Sharad BirdhiChand Sarda v. State of Maharashtra, the Court emphasised the necessity of establishing a clear motive, the death cause by poison, the accused’s possession of poison and opportunity to administer it. Highlighting gaps in evidence, the Court noted the importance of a definite medical opinion regarding the cause of death, raising doubts due to delays in obtaining reports. Despite considering the deceased’s statement, the court emphasised the lack of concrete proof, ultimately leading to the exoneration of the accused due to deficiencies in evidence.Supreme Court Deliberates on Maintainability of PIL in Service MattersDuring the hearing of an appeal stemming from a Delhi High Court judgment, the Supreme Court expressed skepticism regarding the Delhi High Court’s ruling that Public Interest Litigation (PIL) is “not at all” maintainable in service matters. The issue was termed as debatable and has been left open for decision in an appropriate case. The case involved a writ petition challenging the appointments of teachers made in 2008, where the Delhi High Court, referencing a previous Supreme Court judgment, refused to entertain the PIL.

The court expressed disappointment in the Delhi government’s failure to protect the city’s forests and warned that the Chief Secretary could face contempt of court action if the notification is not issued within the stipulated timeframe. The order stems from petitions regarding forest encroachments, with the National Green Tribunal having previously directed the issuance of the Section 20 notification under the Indian Forest Act. The court also demanded a comprehensive affidavit detailing efforts to reclaim encroached land and afforestation measures. The next hearing is scheduled for December 15.Delhi High Court Rejects Plea Against Chhath Puja Ban on Yamuna River BanksThe Delhi High Court has declined to consider a plea challenging the ban on celebrating Chhath Puja on the banks of the Yamuna River in Delhi. Justice Subramonium Prasad emphasised that the ban was implemented to prevent pollution in the Yamuna River and indicated an intention to dismiss the case. The petition, filed by two organisations, the Chhath Pooja Sangharsh Samiti and the Purwanchal Jagriti Manch, contested a Delhi government notification dated October 9, 2021, asserting that the ban violated the fundamental rights of Delhi’s residents. The Court’s inclination to disallow the petition led to its withdrawal by the petitioners’ counsel. Ponds have been provided in various city wards for Chhath Puja celebrations, according to the Delhi government.Himachal Pradesh High Court to Decide on Quashing POCSO Act Cases Involving Marriage of Accused and VictimThe Himachal Pradesh High Court has refused to quash a case under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act) where the accused sought relief by citing his marriage to the victim. Justice Virender Singh disagreed with previous coordinate benches of the High Court that had quashed similar cases in such circumstances. The single judge has referred the matter to the Chief Justice for the formation of a larger bench to determine whether POCSO Act cases can be quashed if the accused has married the victim. Justice Singh stressed that accepting such settlements could encourage criminals to engage in heinous offenses and then compromise with the child victims, undermining the legislative intent behind the POCSO Act. The case highlights a complex legal issue concerning the intersection of justice and the sanctity of marriage.Important Legal News | 07 NovemberBar Council of Gujarat Suspends Advocate Dharmesh J.

Advocates Ishaan Mukherjee, Amrita Chatterjee, Jaspal Singh and Vivek Singh were involved in the legal proceedings.Delhi High Court: ‘Mere Touch’ Not ‘Penetrative’ Sexual Assault under POCSO ActThe Delhi High Court has ruled that a mere touch does not constitute penetrative sexual assault, as defined under Section 3(c) of the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act (POCSO Act). The court clarified that touch is a separate offense under Section 7 of the POCSO Act.This judgment came in a case where a man was convicted of aggravated sexual assault on a 6-year-old girl, involving touching her anal region. The court found inconsistencies in the evidence but upheld the charge of aggravated sexual assault under Section 10.

The court noted that access to education is vital for the rehabilitative goals of imprisonment and cited Rule 104 of the United Nations Standard Minimum Rules for the Treatment of Prisoners, which stresses the importance of education and training for inmates.The two life convicts were admitted to law colleges for LL.B courses and the court allowed them to attend classes online. Physical presence at the college was required for practical training or examinations, during which the convicts would be granted interim bail.Supreme Court Calls for Guidelines on Search and Seizure of Digital Devices, Especially for JournalistsThe Supreme Court has emphasised the need for guidelines to regulate the search and seizure of phones and digital devices, particularly when it involves individuals like journalists or media personnel. The court recognised that media professionals may have confidential information and sources on their devices, making the issue a serious one.While the Central government argued that authorities cannot be entirely restricted from examining such devices due to national security concerns, the court maintained that giving the government unbridled powers without guidelines could be dangerous. The court has given the Central government one month to propose suitable guidelines for such seizures, stressing that the government should play a role in shaping these guidelines.This matter emerged from a public interest litigation (PIL) filed by the Foundation for Media Professionals, seeking guidelines for the search and seizure of digital devices by law enforcement agencies. Another similar petition from academicians and researchers is also before the Supreme Court, addressing concerns about unregulated seizures of digital devices.Important Legal News | 06 NovemberSupreme Court Issues Notice to Government in Challenge to Section 437A of CrPCIn a significant legal development, the Supreme Court of India has issued a notice to the Union of India regarding a plea challenging the constitutionality of Section 437A of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC). This provision allows accused individuals to secure bail during their appeal by furnishing bail bonds with sureties. The plea contends that Section 437A contradicts another section of the CrPC, 354(d), which obliges courts to release the accused. The petitioner argues that the provision lacks proportionality and could result in continued incarceration for those who lack financial resources and sureties. The case raises concerns about unjustified incarceration and potential violations of the fundamental right to liberty under Article 21 of the Constitution. The Central government has been asked to respond to the plea.Case Title: Ajay Verma v. Union Of India And Ors. W.P.(Crl.)

The Madras High Court had previously found the transfer of the case from one district judge to another to be legally questionable and had ordered fresh hearings. The Supreme Court encouraged the petitioners to present their legal arguments before the High Court and expressed concerns about the trial’s transfer. It also appreciated Justice Anand Venkatesh’s observations in the case.Cases : K.Ponmudi v. State SLP(Crl) No. 14197/2023, P.Visalatchi v.

Additionally, Tata Motors is entitled to recover ₹1 crore in costs for pursuing the arbitration proceedings.The background of the case involves land acquisition by the West Bengal government for Tata’s Nano car production, which was later challenged, leading to Tata shifting its operations to Gujarat. This ruling follows years of legal disputes and marks a significant development in the long-standing case. Tata Motors was represented by a team from Avijit Deb Partners, while the WBIDC was represented by a team from JSA Advocates & Solicitors.NBDSA Orders Removal of Times Now Navbharat Show for Communal Bias in Garbha Events DiscussionThe News Broadcasting & Digital Standards Authority (NBDSA) has directed Times Now Navbharat to take down a show hosted by Navika Kumar, as it gave a communal slant to a discussion on Garbha events. The NBDSA found that the broadcaster violated guidelines aimed at preventing communal colours in reporting crimes and related incidents. It was alleged that the show targeted the Muslim community and violated broadcasting standards.The show in question aired a segment discussing women’s safety at public events but was criticised for giving it a communal tilt. The NBDSA ordered the removal of the content from the channel’s website and YouTube within seven days.

The High Court upheld the family court’s jurisdiction to hear original petitions under the Domestic Violence Act, dismissing the petitioner’s objections and concerns.TRAI Informs Supreme Court: Deactivated Mobile Numbers Not Assigned for 90 Days; WhatsApp Data Deleted After 45 DaysThe Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) has informed the Supreme Court that when a cellular mobile telephone number is deactivated due to non-usage or upon subscriber request, it remains unassigned to a new user for a minimum of 90 days. The court emphasised that it’s the responsibility of the previous subscriber to safeguard their privacy.Furthermore, subscribers can prevent WhatsApp data misuse by deleting their WhatsApp account linked to their old phone number and erasing data from local device memory or cloud. WhatsApp revealed that for re-cycled phone numbers, they monitor account inactivity and remove old account data if it remains inactive for 45 days. This information led to the court’s resolution of a 2021 writ petition concerning the misuse of deactivated mobile numbers.Delhi High Court: Child Sexual Abuse Demands Severe Punishment Regardless of BackgroundThe Delhi High Court has underscored the gravity of child sexual abuse, deeming it a pervasive and disturbing issue that warrants the unwavering attention of all stakeholders in the justice system. Justice Sudhir Kumar Jain emphasised that the court has a solemn duty to impose adequate punishment on perpetrators, regardless of their social, economic status, or domestic responsibilities.The court cited the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act of 2012, enacted to safeguard children from sexual offenses, harassment and pornography. The Act treats sexual exploitation and abuse of children as heinous crimes, demanding effective intervention. Justice Jain made these remarks while upholding the conviction of a man for sexually assaulting his 4-year-old son, affirming the need for stern penalties in such cases.Important Legal News | 02 NovemberSupreme Court Rejects Exception 4 Plea, Upholds Conviction in Murder TrialIn a recent ruling, the Supreme Court of India has upheld the conviction of a husband for the murder of his wife. The court ruled that Exception 4 to Section 300 of the Indian Penal Code, which exempts culpable homicide from murder charges in sudden fights or quarrels, does not apply if the offender takes “undue advantage” of the situation.In this case, the wife had poured kerosene on herself to escape further torture during a quarrel, and the husband lit a matchstick, saying, “You Die,” with the intent to kill her.

The case stems from an appeal against a Bombay High Court judgment that recognized a person who self-identifies as a woman as an ‘aggrieved person’ under the Act. The High Court upheld an order for interim maintenance to the respondent.The petitioner argues that the respondent does not meet the criteria for an “aggrieved person” under the DV Act, which pertains to “women” in domestic relationships, and that the marriage was not solemnized. The Supreme Court has granted leave and requested responses from the concerned parties, setting the case for January 2025.Important Legal News | 01 NovemberSupreme Court: Bail Cannot Be Contingent on Co-Accused SurrenderThe Supreme Court, in a recent decision, ruled that the grant of bail to a co-accused cannot be dependent on the surrender of another accused, particularly the main accused. The case involved an accused in a dowry death case, who was the brother of the husband.Notably, the husband was absconding and the trial had commenced without his arrest. Initially, the Patna High Court had granted bail but conditioned it on the husband’s surrender. The Supreme Court, however, modified the bail order, stating that the husband’s surrender was not necessary for the appellant’s release. This decision clarifies that bail should not be contingent on the actions of other accused parties.Case Title: MUNSHI SAH v. THE STATE OF BIHAR & ANR., CRIMINAL APPEAL Nos. 3198-3199 OF 2023Supreme Court Adjourns CBI Appeals in SNC Lavalin Case Involving Kerala Chief MinisterThe Supreme Court has postponed the hearing of appeals filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) challenging the discharge of Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan and other accused in the SNC Lavalin Case. The bench, comprising Justices Surya Kant, Dipankar Datta and Ujjal Bhuyyan, granted the adjournment after the Additional Solicitor General SV Raju, who represents the CBI, requested a passover due to prior commitments.This case concerns alleged corruption in a contract awarded to Canadian company SNC Lavalin for hydro-electric project renovations in Kerala during Pinarayi Vijayan’s tenure as the electricity minister in 1996-98. The matter will be rescheduled for a later date.Delhi Court Criticises Delhi Police for Combining 19 Complaints in One FIR in Delhi Riots CaseA Delhi court has strongly criticised the Delhi Police for consolidating 19 complaints into a single FIR related to the Delhi riots case without a valid basis and ordered separate investigations for each incident. The court, presided over by Additional Sessions Judge Pulastya Pramachala, noted that the police had taken up 20 different places of incidents for investigation within one FIR but failed to question the two key witnesses about the 19 additional incidents.The court emphasised that this approach would be unjust to the 19 additional complainants and their complaints should be independently assessed. The judge made these remarks while acquitting an individual of rioting and unlawful assembly charges, highlighting the flawed practice of clubbing unrelated complaints in one case.Case Title: Kasthuri Ranga v. State Rep. By Addl. Superintendent Of Police CBI And Ors. SLP(Crl) No. 7801/2017 and connected cases.Review Petition Filed Against Supreme Court’s Refusal to Recognise Same-Sex MarriagesA review petition has been submitted to the Supreme Court, contesting the court’s October 17 verdict that denied the recognition of the right of same-sex couples to marry or have civil unions. The review petition was filed by one of the petitioners, Udit Sood, who had initially approached the court.In its previous judgment, a Constitution Bench of the Supreme Court, led by Chief Justice of India DY Chandrachud, had declared that the current law did not acknowledge the right to same-sex marriages or civil unions, leaving it to the Parliament to enact enabling legislation. The court also ruled against the right of same-sex couples to adopt children. While the majority of judges upheld these views, CJI Chandrachud and Justice Kaul dissented, affirming that same-sex couples should be allowed to recognise their relationships as civil unions and adopt children.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "The Concept of Asura Marriage",
    "data": "                      The Asura marriage, stands out as a non-righteous and controversial union, attracting condemnation in Hindu, Buddhist and Jain societies.Marriage has been a cornerstone of human societies throughout history, each culture imbuing it with its unique traditions and rituals. In Hinduism, the concept of marriage is diverse, ranging from sacred ceremonies to more contentious practices.Historical Context on Asura MarriageThe term Asura marriage finds its roots in ancient Hindu scriptures, notably the Manusmriti. Described as a non-righteous form of marriage, Asura marriage involves a bridegroom providing wealth or a bride price to the bride’s father or kinsmen in exchange for marrying her. This practice, akin to a commercial transaction, has been strongly criticised for undermining the principles of consent, equality and dignity.The Manusmriti explicitly labels Asura marriage as a grave sin, emphasising its negative implications. The bride, in such arrangements, is essentially treated as a commodity that can be acquired through financial transactions. This raises ethical concerns about the autonomy of the individuals involved, the absence of the bride’s consent and the potential for coercion.Evolution of the Concept of Asura MarriageOver time, the concept of Asura marriage has evolved, not only in its literal interpretation but also in the understanding of its essence. In the legal case A. L. V. R. S. T. Veerappa Chettiar vs S. Michael (1962), the definition of Asura marriage underwent a transformation.No longer confined to a direct sale transaction, the courts considered the consciousness of the parties or the community involved as a factor in determining whether a marriage is Asura in nature. This shift reflects a more nuanced approach, recognising that the nature of a marriage is not solely defined by material exchanges but also by cultural context and societal perceptions.Legal Perspectives on Asura MarriageThe legal aspects surrounding Asura marriage are crucial in understanding how societies have grappled with this tradition. The case of Kailasanatha Mudaliar v. Parasakthi Vadivanni (1931) established a test for identifying Asura marriages. If the bridegroom provides money or anything of value to the bride’s father for his benefit or as consideration for him to give his daughter in marriage, it is deemed an Asura marriage.This legal perspective sheds light on the financial transactions inherent in Asura marriages and the courts’ role in defining and categorising such unions. The evolving nature of these definitions, as seen in later cases, reflects a broader understanding of the cultural and social dimensions surrounding marriage.Ethical Concerns on Asura MarriageAsura marriage raises significant ethical concerns, primarily revolving around the commodification of the bride and the potential for exploitation. The practice of purchasing brides through financial transactions undermines the principles of equality and consent. It allows wealthy individuals, regardless of their competence or character, to accumulate multiple wives, while it places financial barriers for those less affluent.The lack of agency for the bride is a critical ethical issue. In Asura marriages, the consent of the bride might be absent and she might be coerced into the union for her father’s selfish monetary motives. This not only violates the autonomy of the individual but also perpetuates gender inequalities within the institution of marriage.Cultural and Religious Perspectives on Asura MarriageAsura marriage is not limited to Hindu Law; its condemnation extends to Buddhist and Jain societies as well. These traditions share ethical concerns about the nature of such marriages, viewing them as lowly and undignified. The cultural and religious perspectives emphasise the importance of dignified and consensual unions, reflecting broader societal values.While Hindu scriptures like Manusmriti condemn Asura marriages, it is crucial to recognise that interpretations may vary within different sects and communities. Some may strictly adhere to these prohibitions, while others may adopt more liberal views, emphasising personal choice and consent in marriage.Modern Reflections and Legal Reforms on Asura MarriageIn contemporary times, many legal systems worldwide prohibit practices resembling Asura marriages. Such prohibitions align with evolving societal norms that prioritise individual rights, gender equality and the protection of vulnerable individuals. The legal reforms reflect a commitment to dismantling practices that undermine the principles of justice and fairness.As societies evolve, so do their legal frameworks. The shift from a literal interpretation of Asura marriages to a more consciousness-based approach in the case law indicates a responsiveness to changing cultural and societal norms. The recognition that marriages should be founded on consent and mutual respect highlights the ongoing dialogue between tradition and modernity.ConclusionThe Asura marriage, rooted in ancient Hindu traditions, stands as a testament to the complexities inherent in cultural practices. Its evolution from a literal sale transaction to a more nuanced understanding reflects the adaptability of legal interpretations to changing societal norms.Asura marriages, condemned for their ethical shortcomings, have sparked legal discourse and reforms aimed at aligning marriage practices with contemporary values of consent, equality and individual autonomy. Understanding the historical context, legal perspectives and ethical concerns surrounding Asura marriages provides valuable insights into the dynamic interplay between tradition and evolving societal norms.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Nature of Muslim Marriage",
    "data": "                      Muslim marriage, a sacred institution in Islam, has been a subject of profound contemplation and debate within the Islamic legal tradition. Divergent views exist regarding its nature, with some scholars portraying it as a purely civil contract and others emphasising its religious sacramental essence.This article explores the multifaceted nature of Muslim marriage, delving into its contractual aspects, legal foundations and the spiritual significance that intertwines with the social fabric of Islamic societies.Contractual Nature of Muslim MarriageThe nature of Muslim marriage is considered a contract.The dimensions related to the contractual nature of Muslim Marriage are:Consent and ProposalOne of the key resemblances between Muslim marriage and a civil contract lies in the requirement of free and mutual consent. The marriage contract, initiated by a proposal (Ijab) from one party and acceptance (Qubul) from the other, mirrors the essential elements of a contractual agreement. This underscores the importance of voluntariness and the absence of coercion in the establishment of a marital union.Capacity and GuardianshipSimilar to contractual agreements, the capacity of the parties involved is crucial. In the case of minors, a guardian may enter into a marriage contract on their behalf. However, Islamic jurisprudence allows the minor to annul the contract upon reaching the age of puberty, adding a layer of legal protection to the vulnerable.Ante-Nuptial and Post-Nuptial AgreementsThe flexibility inherent in Islamic law is reflected in the permissibility of ante-nuptial and post-nuptial agreements. Parties entering into a Muslim marriage can tailor the contractual terms to their specific circumstances, aligning with the principle of contractual freedom within legal bounds.Modification of TermsThe malleability of the marriage contract within legal limits distinguishes it from a rigid sacrament. Islamic jurisprudence allows for the alteration of terms to accommodate the changing needs and dynamics of the marital relationship, resembling the adaptability found in contractual agreements.Breach of ContractWhile discouraged, the provision for the breach of a marriage contract adds a contractual nature to Muslim marriage. This aspect acknowledges the reality that marriages may face challenges and legal mechanisms exist for the resolution of such issues, akin to contractual dispute resolution.Legal Foundations on Contractual Nature of Muslim MarriageThe assertion by some scholars, including Justice Mahmood, that nature of Muslim marriage is fundamentally a civil contract and is based on the observable similarities with contractual agreements. In Abdul Kadir vs Salima (1886), Justice Mahmood emphasised the civil nature of Muslim marriage, highlighting its dependence on the declaration, acceptance and the presence of witnesses.Justice Mahmood cautioned against equating Dower (Mahr) in Muslim marriage with consideration in civil contracts. Dower, he emphasised, is a commitment by the husband to provide financial support to the wife, emphasising its distinct nature from the consideration in contractual agreements.The Hedaya, a classic Islamic legal manual, acknowledges that the payment of dower is a symbolic gesture of respect for the woman. It clarifies that while the mention of dower is not essential for the validity of a marriage, its payment reflects the husband’s commitment and responsibility.Sacramental and Social Dimensions on Nature of Muslim MarriageDespite the contractual elements, Muslim marriage is deeply imbued with religious significance. The solemnisation often involves the recitation of Quranic verses and Islamic principles and ethics guide the process. The spiritual connection between the couple is considered sacred, elevating the marriage beyond a mere legal contract.Justice Mahmood, while emphasising the civil nature of Muslim marriage, acknowledged its social aspects. Marriage is a legal contract and a source of solace and companionship in life. This recognition intertwines the legal and social dimensions, emphasising the holistic nature of Muslim marriage.ConclusionThe nature of Muslim marriage is considered to be a civil contract. However, some jurists highlight its profound religious and spiritual significance.The flexibility of Islamic law allows for the accommodation of diverse perspectives, recognising the evolving dynamics of marital relationships. Ultimately, Muslim marriage is a comprehensive institution that encompasses legal obligations, spiritual connections and societal harmony, reflecting the richness and complexity of Islamic jurisprudence.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "

    "headline": "Reference under CPC",
    "data": "                      Reference under CPC holds paramount importance by serving as a legal avenue for subordinate courts to seek the High Court’s guidance on complex legal questions during ongoing cases.This process ensures the correct interpretation of the law, preventing errors and enhancing legal clarity. By allowing lower courts to refer specific legal issues to higher authorities, the CPC promotes fair and informed judgments.The High Court’s opinion, obtained through a reference in CPC, contributes to the resolution of legal uncertainties, upholding the integrity of the judicial process and fostering consistency in legal decision-making throughout the legal system.Definition of Reference under CPCThe concept of reference in CPC occurs when a lower court seeks guidance from the High Court on a legal matter. This typically happens when the lower court encounters reasonable doubt regarding a legal question during a civil suit, appeal or execution proceeding. In simple terms, a reference involves asking the High Court for its opinion on a legal issue.Section 113 of the Civil Procedure CodeSection 113 grants authority to a lower court to present a case to the High Court and request its opinion. Such a request is made when the lower court harbours uncertainty about a legal question.It’s important to note that parties involved in the civil suit do not have the right to request a reference; only the lower court possesses the ability to initiate it on its own. The reference is exclusive to questions of law and the judge presiding over the case must genuinely doubt the legal aspect in question.Objectives of Reference in CPCThe main purpose of reference under CPC is to enable lower courts to seek the High Court’s opinion in non-appealable cases, ensuring clarity on legal matters and preventing irreversible errors. The provision also serves to guarantee that the highest court in the state interprets and decides the validity of legislative provisions (Acts, Ordinances or regulations).Importantly, the reference in CPC should be made before the lower court passes its judgment to ensure a proper legal understanding.Conditions for Reference under CPCThe process of making a reference to the High Court, as outlined in Order 46 of the Civil Procedure Code, involves certain conditions that the subordinate court must meet. Here are the key conditions:The suit or appeal must be actively underway in the court at the time of making the reference and no further appeal from the court’s order or decree should be pending.The question regarding the validity of a legal provision must have arisen during the proceedings of the suit in the court.The court must be actively handling the suit when the doubt about the validity of the legal provision emerges.During the reference under CPC, the district court has the authority to either stay the case or issue a contingent order. After considering the High Court’s opinion, the subordinate court may then proceed to pass a final order or decree.Types of Questions for Reference in CPCThere are two categories of legal questions that may lead to doubts in the subordinate court:Questions related to the validity of Acts, Ordinances or Regulations.Other legal questions.Under the first category, reference in CPC is mandatory if the following conditions are met:a. The decision on the question is essential for resolving the case.b. The subordinate court believes that the Act, Ordinance or regulation is beyond its legal authority.c. There is no previous determination by the Supreme Court or the relevant High Court on the vires of the Act.Who Can Apply for Reference under CPC?The court of civil judicature has the authority to refer a case to the High Court either based on a party’s application or suo moto (on its own initiative). It’s important to note that a tribunal does not have the power to make a reference, as established in the case of Ramakant Bindal v. State of U.P.Powers and Duties of the Referring CourtA reference under CPC can only be made in a suit, appeal or execution proceeding pending before the court when there is a genuine doubt of law. It was emphasised in the case of Banarasi Yadav v. Krishna Chandra that the legal question causing doubt must have actually arisen in the case for adjudication and should not be a hypothetical issue. Therefore, references cannot be made based on hypothetical questions or points that may or may not arise in the future. However, if such a situation does arise, it may be considered for reference.Power and Duty of the High CourtConsultative Jurisdiction: The High Court possesses consultative jurisdiction when a reference is sought. It is not obligated to solely decide the specific legal question in doubt. As established in the case of S.K. Roy v. Board of Revenue, the High Court can also consider new aspects of the law if they emerge during the proceedings.Discretion in Answering Questions: The High Court has discretion in answering the referred question under CPC. According to Order 46 of the Code, the High Court may choose to answer the question and send the case back to the referring court for disposal in line with the law. Alternatively, the High Court has the authority to refuse to answer the question and can even quash it.Effects of Reference under CPCImpact on Decree: In the case of L.S Sherlekar v. D.L. Agarwal, it was established that if the High Court answers the question in favour of the plaintiff, the decree is confirmed. Conversely, if the High Court’s response is unfavorable, the suit is dismissed.Decision Transmission: Rule 3 of Order 46 stipulates that after hearing the parties, if the High Court desires, it shall decide the referred points and send a copy of its judgment to the subordinate court. The subordinate court then disposes of the case in accordance with the decisions outlined in the judgment.Procedure at HearingRule 1: Statement and FormulationThe referring court, under Rule 1, is required to draft a statement outlining the facts of the case. It should also formulate the specific legal question on which it seeks the High Court’s opinion and provide its own opinion on the matter.Rule 2: Stay or Contingent DecreeRule 2 allows the referring court to take certain actions. It may choose to stay the proceedings or issue a decree or order contingent upon the High Court’s decision on the referred point. Importantly, this decree or order cannot be executed until the referring court receives a copy of the High Court’s judgment on the reference.Decree Confirmation or DismissalIf the High Court favours the plaintiff’s position in its response, the decree will be confirmed.Conversely, if the High Court’s response is unfavourable, the suit will be dismissed.Rule 3: High Court Decision TransmissionRule 3 stipulates that after hearing the parties, if they wish to be heard, the High Court must decide the referred point. Following this decision, the High Court must send a copy of its judgment to the referring court, which will then dispose of the case in accordance with the High Court’s decision.Rule 5: High Court’s Authority to Alter Decrees or OrdersAccording to Rule 5, the High Court has the authority to alter, cancel or set aside any decree or order made by the referring court. The High Court can then issue any order it deems appropriate.CostRule 4: Costs of Reference under CPCUnder Rule 4, the cost of the reference in CPC is considered as part of the overall costs of the case.Exception:However, in the judgment of L.S. Sherlekar v. D.S. Agarwal (AIR 1968 Bom 439), it was determined that if the reference is deemed altogether unwarranted, the High Court has the discretion to direct the referring judge to personally bear the costs.ConclusionA reference under CPC occurs when a subordinate court seeks the High Court’s opinion on a legal matter during a pending suit, appeal or execution proceeding. Governed by Order 46, the referring court formulates a legal question, stays proceedings or issues a contingent order and sends the question to the High Court.After hearing parties, the High Court provides an opinion, confirming a decree if favourable or dismissing the suit if not. The referring court then disposes of the case accordingly. The cost of reference is typically part of the overall case costs unless the reference in CPC is deemed unwarranted, leading to potential personal cost responsibility for the referring judge.Case BriefsLaw Notes for All SubjectsAdministrative Law NotesArbitration & Conciliation Act NotesLaw of Contracts NotesConstitutional Law NotesCorporate Law NotesCRPC NotesCyber Law NotesEnvironmental Law NotesLaw of Evidence NotesFamily Law NotesHuman Rights Law NotesInternational Law NotesIndian Partnership Act NotesIndian Penal Code NotesIntellectual Property Rights NotesJurisprudence NotesLaw of Torts NotesSale of Goods Act NotesTransfer of Property Act NotesOther Laws NotesImportant StatisticsSite users: 5+ LakhsSite viewership: 1.5M+ per monthInstagram followers: 10,000+ (Click Here)LinkedIn followers: 28,000+ (Click Here)WhatsApp groups: 27,000+ members (Click Here)Telegram channel: 6,500+ members (Click Here)Push notification Subscribers: 35,000+ "
