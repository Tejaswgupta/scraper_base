    "headline": "The Rise Of Deepfake Technology: A Threat To Evidence In Arbitration?",
    "data": "In the recent week, a video had been circulating of  Rashmika Mandanna which was later proven to be deepfaked. The video caused  immense humiliation to the actress who later on went to Instagram expressing  her displeasure. Famous Actor Amitabh Bachan also went to social media to  express his views to the same. Deepfakes are something that has come to public  attention in recent times and is now proving to be dangerous. A fictitious  video was circulated where Russian President Vladimir Putin had purported to  announce a full-scale war against Ukraine. Russian television aired this fake  video, creating misunderstanding and escalating geopolitical tensions.[1] In  the midst of the 2024 US presidential campaign, social media is overrun with  deepfake videos intended to influence public opinion. Even though big social  media companies like Facebook and Twitter have made an effort to forbid and  delete this kind of content, the efficacy of these measures is still debatable. In the Indian landscape as well, deepfakes have come  to lime light. For instance, during the Delhi Elections, 2 videos popped up  online wherein a politician is seen pleading with voters from various  linguistic backgrounds while speaking in two different languages. Upon closer  examination, it became evident that the videos were fake and that they were  made as part of his party's \"positive campaigning\" using Deepfake. [3]Consider all the various pornographic sites where  various famous actresses' faces have been deepfaked and misused. In 2020, a student in  Mumbai was arrested for making a deepfake porn video of his girlfriend to  threaten her. The technology is  now being used by fraudsters as well who pretend to be their loved ones and  friends in video calls asking for money when they are in dire need and scamming  them of their money. [4]The use of the faces of public figures or celebrities  in videos doing something out of character. All of this has made this an issue that  now needs to be addressed.  Deepfake is a  kind of AI technology that creates synthetic media like images, videos, and  audio using machine learning algorithms, especially generative adversarial  networks (GANs). The generator network generates artificial data that mimics  the actual data in the training set, like a synthetic image. After that, the  discriminator network evaluates the veracity of the synthetic data and gives  the generator input on how to enhance its output. Until the generator generates synthetic data that is  remarkably realistic and challenging to discern from the real data, this  process is repeated numerous times, during which the discriminator and  generator learn from one another.Using this training data, deepfakes are produced that  can be used in a variety of ways for both images and videos. (a) face swapping:  substituting one person's face for the one in the video; (b) attribute editing:  altering the video subject's appearance, such as their hair colour or style;  (c) face re-enactment: projecting the subject's facial expressions from one  person's face onto the subject in the target video; and (d) material that is  entirely synthetic: Although real material is used to train people's  appearances, the final image is completely artificial.ConcernsAuthentication  is fundamental to the admissibility of evidence. If the arbitration tribunals  admit evidence which are falsified then it can cause grave injustice to the  other party and hence lead to violation of natural justice. To authenticate the  evidence, experts need to be used which can lead to extra costs being incurred  and time being spend. “Deepfakes will make it easier for liars  to deny the truth in distinct ways. A person accused of having said or done  something might create doubt about the accusation by using altered video or  audio evidence that appears to contradict the claim,” their paper states.”Additionally, deepfakes  raise the possibility that credible but fabricated evidence will be used to  support an unfair conclusion. In the trials being held for the invasion of the  US Capitol, this similar tactic is being used by the Defendants to undermine  the evidence brought forward by the prosecution.  Even if the court, brings in experts to  authenticate the evidence, it only delays the matter and serves the Defendant  in the end. The report on ‘virtual justice’ by New York-based privacy group  Surveillance Technology Oversight Project (STOP) noted that parties to online  court proceedings may be asked to verify their identity by providing sensitive  personal information, biometric data, or facial scans – in the state of Oregon,  judges sign into their virtual court systems using facial recognition.[9]Detecting  Deepfakes: An Impossible Venture?To  identify deepfakes, there are a number of technical options available, such as  the following: [10]As  we move towards greener arbitration, the fears towards the use of video  conferencing as a means to record evidence is genuine. But as we as a society  incorporate new practices or new ways of doing things, new problems will arise  and it is quite obvious. What needs to be done is formulating solutions to  address these new problems instead of restricting progress. Currently in India,  to prosecute crimes with regard to deepfakes, the IT Act lays down the  following provisions. However,  these laws are not enough and we need an elaborative provision to deal with  deepfake crimes. As the Digital India Act 2023, is said to replace the IT Act  we just have to wait and see how it addresses deepfakes. It is expected that  the new law will address current technologies and crime with respect to it.  There is also a need for lawyers to be trained with respect to artificial  intelligence. Proper training can allow arbitrators and counsels to detect the use  of deepfake technology in evidence. There is also need for expert verification  of video evidence before admission so as to establish genuinity. Necessary  protocols and guidelines need to be established. The use of deepfake in  evidence has not yet become too apparent but in the future it will and we as a  community need to ready.  The concerns  are not just restricted to arbitration but also court litigation as well.  The  author is an Advocate practicing at Goa.

    "headline": "My Lord, It's not about 'Your Honour'!",
    "data": "\"You cannot force  someone to respect you, but you can refuse to be disrespected\", a quote,  though by someone unknown, truly encapsulates the natural principle of human  tendencies, which, in all circumstances, cannot be so regulated through rules  and procedures, as the subjects are products of emotions largely, than of  logic. The fluid nature and fine line of distinguishable difference between  respect and disrespect, tends to define the relations in personal and  professional space, and is no different when it comes to how the learned  counsels, public officials and other members of the public, are found  addressing the honourable judges in our country. As it is usually said, that  the past will define the future, in many ways, India is still being subjected  to adopted slavery with the carrying on of the British Courts' undefined and  unreasoned practices. It bears no doubt that many countries use titles for  addressing the honourable judges in accordance with their customs and  traditions. However, the use of the titles viz. 'Your lordship/ladyship' and  'Milord/My Lord' to address the honourable Judges in India, prevent us to give  our court system an identity of its own and a sense of belongingness 'WE, THE  PEOPLE OF INDIA' desire.Before, we advert to the real and practical issues  concerning the need to have a uniform and pervasive implementation of a  localized suited system of addressing the honourable judges in our country, the  practice as is presently being found prevalent in twenty five (25) major  countries of the world, must be seen, if not studied, to understand the context  and issues surrounding therewith, the same being contained herein below, in the  form of tabular researched details:Notably, one can easily relate to, that apart from many other practices,  India has inherited courtroom etiquettes from the British. In other words, they  are a relic of colonial rule. In the United Kingdom, judges of the Court of  Appeals and the High Court are addressed as 'My Lord' or 'My Lady'; Circuit  judges as 'Your Honour'; Magistrates as 'Your Worship', or 'Sir' or 'Madam';  and District judges and Tribunal judges as 'Sir' or 'Madam'. Therefore, the  genesis of the legality of such use, has been in the long usage of the  practice, and being passed on from generation to generation, through learnings  of the court craft and procedures.In the  Indian context, where the country's social fabric is interwoven with secularism  and equality, if one studies the general parlance, the term 'Lord' is  understood in terms of attributing the said title to Deities namely Lord Shiva  (Hindus), Lord Jesus (Christians), Rabb/Allah (Lord and Master/God) - [Muslims]  and others, and accordingly, the usage does not bear any semblance to any  living personality in any manner. The status of faith and divine powers, could  not have been so meant to be bestowed upon a living individual or group of  individuals, and that too way by a select few, in the course of professional  etiquettes, without having a wilful acceptance of the people at large. Such  titles are though just 'Honorifics' as a matter of court practice, but may have  a tendency to be wrongly understood in its extension or overlap with religious  practices and sentiments of any or every community in India. Therefore, the  compulsion to address the honourable judges as such, being a part of legacy and  unwritten long-standing diktat, was to be shown the guided route in order to  bring out a near uniform approach, consistent with the dignity and majesty of  the courts and largely, for the justice delivery system as a whole. The role of the regulator of the legal profession, cannot be  forgotten, and has to be valued both in terms of its rule making and supervisory  duties towards the implementation of its rules, policies and standards. The Bar  Council of India is a statutory body created by Parliament to regulate and  represent the Indian bar. The council performs the regulatory function by  prescribing standards of professional conduct and etiquette and by exercising  disciplinary jurisdiction over the bar. The home page on the official website  of the Bar Council of India, displays the description of a page titled as  'Brief History of law in India' as is available at specific web link i.e. http://www.barcouncilofindia.org/about/about-the-legal-profession/legal-education-in-the-united-kingdom/, wherein it is stated that, as extracted  in parts: \"Law in India has evolved from religious  prescription to the current constitutional and legal system we have today,  traversing through secular legal systems and the common law. Secular law in  India varied widely from region to region and from ruler to ruler. Law as a matter of religious prescriptions  and philosophical discourse has an illustrious history in India. The Indian Bar  had a role in the Independence movement that can hardly be overstated –  that the tallest leaders of the movement across the political spectrum were  lawyers is ample proof. The Constitution of India is the guiding light in all  matters executive, legislative and judicial in the country. It is extensive and  aims to be sensitive. The Constitution turned the direction of system originally introduced for perpetuation of  colonial and imperial interests in India, firmly in the direction of social  welfare. The Constitution explicitly and through judicial interpretation seeks  to empower the weakest members of the society. India has an organic law as  consequence of common law system. Through judicial pronouncements and  legislative action, this has been fine-tuned for Indian conditions. The Indian  legal system's move towards a social justice paradigm, though undertook  independently, can be seen to mirror the changes in other territories with  common law system. From an artifice of  the colonial masters, the Indian legal system has evolved as an essential  ingredient of the world's largest democracy and a crucial front in the battle to  secure constitutional rights for every citizen.\" (emphasis supplied), and make  us to realize the need for localization of the practices and procedures, best aligned  to our own people and their needs, in the application of law for dispensation  of justice.In  the said direction forward, the Bar Council of India made a serious attempt in  the year 2006 post consideration of the observations of the Hon'ble Supreme  Court of India in re Progressive & Vigilant Lawyers Forum [W.P. (Civil)  40/2006] that the matter was to be decided by the BCI as how the Judges should  be addressed, by exercising its powers under Section 49(1)(c) of the Advocates  Act, 1961, and made rules on professional and etiquette standards to be  observed by advocates, in so far as it related to addressing the honourable  judges in different courts in the country and in furtherance thereof, Chapter IIIA to Part VI of the BCI Rules  was added through a resolution by the council. The relevant extract of the said  resolution is reproduced herein below, for ready reference:CHAPTER-IIIA: To address the CourtConsistent  with the obligation of the Bar to show a respectful attitude towards the Court  and bearing in mind the dignity of Judicial Office, the form of address to be adopted whether in the Supreme Court, High  Courts or Subordinate Courts should be as follows: \"Your Honour\" or \"Hon'ble  Court\" in Supreme Court & High Courts and in the Subordinate Courts and  Tribunals it is open to the Lawyers to address the Court as \"Sir\" or the  equivalent word in respective regional languages.Explanation-  As the words \"My Lord\" and  \"Your Lordship\" are relics of a Colonial past, it is proposed to incorporate  the above rule showing respectful attitude to the Court.The said resolution was circulated vide  letter bearing ref. no. STBC (CIR) No.11/2006 dated 20.04.2006 by the Bar  Council of India to the Secretaries of all the State Bar Councils and also to  the Registrars' of all the High Courts in the country, requesting them to  circulate the said resolution to all the Bar Associations in their states, and  to others also, in order to give adequate publicity to the said resolution  among the lawyers. Subsequent thereof, the same was published in the Gazette of  India and officially came into force with effect from 06.05.2006, with its addition  as Chapter IIIA in Part VI in the Bar Council of India Rules. But, where is the controversy now when the  law is clear, concise and communicated to everyone, and calling out only for  compliance?The  answer lies in self-contradictions by the Bar Council of India itself, besides  the non-adoption of it by the Hon'ble Courts, and mixed as well as confused  fearful compliance by the learned advocates. The losing party in the entire  official transaction is a learned advocate, who has been put in a fix, with the  continuing incertitude about the use of right title or term. Nobody as it is  felt, might be so interested to bring such change in the courtroom, where the use  of title, in line with the Bar Council of India's rule, is not prevalent or  otherwise encouraged. Although, the Bar Associations of the Kerala High Court  and the Punjab & Haryana High Court have issued resolutions in line with  the council's rule deprecating the practice of using 'My Lord' and 'Your  Lordship', the success might not have come much as intended.The  2006 rule discouraged the use of 'My Lord' and 'Your Lordship', and prescribed 'Your  Honour' or 'Hon'ble Court' as an acceptable way for addressing the Supreme  Court & High Courts, and 'Sir' in Subordinate Courts and Tribunals. But,  the said distinction too is unnecessary as respect towards and faith reposed in  the judicial office cannot be segregated in terms of the jurisdiction  exercised, and the real difficulty has been created by our own council by issuing  a press release dated 23.02.2021 wherein it has been informed that:\"The  BCI would like to clarify that as far as back on 28th September, 2019 on the  request made by Office-Bearers of Bar Association of some High Courts with  regard to the Advocates addressing the court, it was resolved that as per  mostly preferred and prevalent practice, lawyers of the country be requested to  address the Hon'ble Judges of various High Courts and Supreme Court as 'My  Lord' or 'Your Lordships' or 'Hon'ble Court', while Lawyers of Subordinate  Courts, Tribunals and other Forums may address the Court as 'Your Honour' or  'Sir' or the equivalent word in respective regional languages.\"However,  it is not at all clear if the existing rule has been amended in line with the  resolution, which is purportedly being circulated as a press release, as issued  by the learned Chairman of the Bar Council of India. Usually, it is found that  press releases, on behalf of a public authority, are issued by or in the name  of the Secretary of that authority with specific identity number, being its  file reference number, along with the date of such issuance, and even the  resolution dated 28 September, 2021 as referred in the press release, does not  find uploaded on the official website of the Bar Council of India. But in no  way, the statutory rule, already notified, could be taken off the statute book,  by passing a resolution and that too, without bringing the copy of the original  document within the knowledge of the interested and affected stakeholders.Over  to the judicial set-up with much flip-flops and varied approaches being  witnessed, in the year 2019, the Hon'ble Rajasthan High Court, in its full  court meeting had unanimously resolved to request the counsels and those who  appear before the Court to desist from addressing the Hon'ble Judges as 'My  Lord' and 'Your Lordship', to honour the mandate of equality enshrined in the  Constitution of India. Similarly, many  judges including Mr. Justice  Ravindra Bhat, Judge, Supreme Court of India, Mr. Justice S. Muralidhar, Chief  Justice, Orissa High Court, Mr. Justice Arun Kumar Tyagi, Judge, Punjab &  Haryana High Court, Mr. Justice P Krishna Bhat, Judge, Judge Karnataka High  Court, have asked, time and again, the learned advocates not to address them as  'lordships'. However, to the other side of the coin, being the judicial side of  adjudication of the said issue of addressing the judges, a remark was found  made by the then Chief Justice of India, Mr. Justice S. A. Bobde on 13.08.2020 wherein  the title 'Your Honour' was held to be inappropriate to be used in the Hon'ble  Supreme Court of India, partaking the practice of the court beyond and above  the law of the land in force. Similar was the issue in the year 2014, in the  matter of Shiv Sagar Tiwari vs Secretary General SCI and Ors. [W.P. (Civil) No.  881/2013], wherein the Hon'ble Supreme Court of India had rejected the petition  seeking the ban  on the usage of archaic expressions of 'My Lord', your Lordship' and such  others to be a symbol of slavery and against the dignity of the country, by  terming the same as a 'negative prayer' and stated that the terms 'My Lord' and  'Your Lordship' had never been compulsory.'Specific Courtroom Compliance' i.e. a courtroom where the use of  colonial titles 'My Lord', 'Your Lordship' and such others, is forbidden or  discouraged, at the instance of the request made or direction issued by the presiding judge, or otherwise being fearlessly shunned by majority of  the learned lawyers, in their own volition as a matter of compliance to the  rule framed and notified by the Bar Council of India, has grown out bigger each  day, as a general norm in the last fifteen (15) years with few such courtrooms  being found as such and there appears to be no change being expected in the  offing, and learned advocates who have to uphold the best interests of his or  her client, would himself or herself generally restrain from mis-adventuring in  such cause for obvious reasons, and yes, these are those practical difficulties  being faced with no clear solutions. Be that as it may, the issue is not just  about respect or disrespect to the Hon'ble Judges, but it travels beyond it, to  our freedom from colonization and in an extended or pure view, a creative thorn  to our independence, whether judicial or otherwise.The  identification of the problem and its appropriate description is not  sufficient, unless accompanied with a solution. In this issue, simply the  acceptance of the rule framed by the Bar Council of India, by all the Hon'ble  Judges is the fast forward solution, as to be practiced by the learned lawyers  over a period of time, to make it a behavioural pattern in their courtroom  exchange. The usage of terms or tiles like \"Your Honour\" or \"Hon'ble Court\" or  \"Hon'ble Bench\" or \"Hon'ble Sir or Madam\" in a respectful manner, which is reflected  through body language of the person addressing, as a means of non-verbal  communication, is a more appropriate and desirable way of addressing the judges. The same should not be perceived as disrespectful and  unconventional and should be left entirely to the discretion of the learned  advocates, as respect through compulsion is no respect, whether or not, the  same is given or received. It is believed that the council's rule of  distinguishing the subordinate courts being the district judiciary, from the  High Courts and the Supreme Court, in terms of usage of the titles or terms  while addressing the their honourable judges, too should be avoided and  necessary amendments be made. Lastly, and at least, a matter before the Hon'ble  Court should not get prejudiced only because of the way a learned advocate,  being an officer of the court, addresses the honourable presiding judge(s), and  practice of law, being a noble profession, should be left to take its own creative  and corrective course of action, in the pursuit of justice.The author, Mohit Kumar Gupta is an advocate at High  Court of Delhi and District Courts-Delhi NCR.
