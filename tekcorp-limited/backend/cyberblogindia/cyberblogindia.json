    "headline": "A Look at International Regulations on E-Waste in 2023",
    "data": "We produced a compelling 2.4 kg per capita e-waste in India in 2019. However, the problem of e-waste runs deeper than just in India. By 2050, global e-waste production is set to reach a worrying 120 million tonnes per year. This is more than twice what the number is at present! Electronic waste, or e-waste, refers to discarded electrical and electronic equipment. Televisions, computers, lamps, mobile phones, refrigerators, etcetera are all examples of it. E-waste has become one of the fastest-growing waste streams in today’s time. This article looks at international regulations and country-specific legal initiatives for e-waste regulation.The Basel Convention on the Control of Transboundary Movements of Hazardous Wastes and Their Disposal is an international treaty effective May 1992. This treaty prohibits the transfer of e-waste from developed to developing countries. Over 180 countries came together at the Basel Convention in Switzerland to sign the treaty, enforcing legalisations that reduced the world’s transboundary movement of hazardous waste. However, the issue of e-waste is yet to be quashed entirely. Estimates suggest that the European Union (EU), for instance, illegally exports 352,474 metric tonnes of e-waste to developing countries yearly. The United States has gone so far as to not ratify the treaty despite being one of the highest e-waste-producing countries in the world.  Europe—the EU, in particular— has been at the forefront of introducing regulations on e-waste over the years. The EU introduced the Waste Shipment Regulation (WSR) in 1993, which prohibited the shipment of hazardous e-waste from its member states to non-OECD countries. It then launched the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive, which limited the use of hazardous substances in the manufacturing and packaging of electrical equipment and also sought to increase the recycling of e-waste. In 2012 came the new Waste from Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) Directive (2012/19/EU), which listed the requirements for proper disposal of e-waste to ensure high recycling and subsequent high reusability of the waste. Also, the producers of said equipment have the responsibility of responsible disposal and recycling imposed on them. The WEEE regulations are applicable in member states of the EU, the UK and Norway. Countries like Switzerland, Iceland, and others have similar national legislation. In Oceania, Australia has enacted a national law on e-waste regulation. Under the Product Stewardship Act 2011, regulations provide the service of recycling televisions and computers to households and small businesses. New Zealand and other countries in the Pacific Islands region, in contrast, are yet to develop a national law specifically for the same. The latter depends mainly on the Secretariat of the Pacific Regional Environment Programme (SPREP) and the EU to coordinate and promote waste management in the region.In 2011, the Indian government introduced the E-Waste Management and Handling Rules, which introduced Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). The producers of EEE were made responsible for e-waste management. Since then, it has updated the e-waste rules in 2016 (to introduce provisions on authorisation, product stewardship and Producer Responsibility Organisations) and in 2022 (to prohibit the use of hazardous materials in the manufacture of goods and establish a target for producers for recycling of up to 70% of all e-waste in the coming years). A detailed discussion on e-waste regulation in India is available here.China’s national e-waste legislation regulates the collection and management of 14 types of e-waste. These include televisions, refrigerators, washing machines, air conditioners, personal computers, range hoods, electric water heaters, gas water heaters, fax machines, mobile phones, single-machine telephones, printers, copiers, and monitors. China’s first ban on e-waste imports came after the Basel Ban, before which the country received WEEE from developed nations. Since then, the country’s government has introduced several regulations which seek to standardise e-waste recycling in national and provincial systems. Some countries in Southeast Asia, like the Philippines, Cambodia, and Myanmar, are advancing regulations on the management of hazardous waste to promote proper WEEE management. In contrast, most countries in Central and Western Asia are lagging in this regard. Even if a country has WEEE legislation (like Kazakhstan’s EPR system), they lack the infrastructure to manage the e-waste fully. Or in the case of the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which has a specialised facility for e-waste in Dubai, the problem of e-waste management remains primarily in the informal sector. African nations have received a significant portion of the illegal e-waste exported out of developed nations over the years despite the continent not having sufficient e-waste management systems in place. The informal sector dominates the management of e-waste in Africa — scrapyards like Agbogbloshie (Africa’s biggest e-waste dump) in Ghana have workers who search for valuable metals like aluminium and copper in the e-waste. Even in countries with national or regional legislation (Egypt, Ghana, Madagascar, Nigeria, Rwanda, South Africa, etc.), enforcing the regulations is challenging. Still, it is crucial to note that governments in the continent are taking steps to change the scenario.Climate change and technology are the two realities of this century. When combined for the worse, they make the world’s plight more wretched than ever before. July 2023 signalled a move from global warming to “global boiling“, according to the UN. A similar predicament awaits climate change, and this stream of e-waste might just be the catalyst that pushes climate change to climate catastrophe. Let’s be more considerate and ensure e-waste is treated adequately globally.Featured Image Credits: Image by Freepik"

    "headline": "An Introduction to Predictive Policing",
    "data": "The criminal justice system continues to undergo significant transformations as technology is critical in detecting, investigating, and prosecuting crimes. With further advancements, there is a growing need to leverage AI to address the challenges faced by the Indian justice system. Former Chief Justice of India, S. A. Bobde, recognised the potential of AI. He stated that,“we have a possibility of developing Artificial Intelligence for the court system to prevent undue delays in the administration of justice.”However, integrating AI into the criminal justice system is not without challenges. Common concerns are data privacy, algorithmic bias, and ethical implications. Therefore, the application of AI must accompany appropriate regulations and ethical considerations. As law enforcement agencies play an undeniably important role in the criminal justice system, this article explains what predictive policing is.Predictive policing has emerged as a powerful tool for identifying patterns in crime data. By analysing information such as time, location, and type of crimes, predictive policing can help forecast where crimes are likely to occur. This capability allows law enforcement agencies strategically allocate their resources, including personnel deployment and camera installation in high-risk areas. The primary objective behind predictive policing is to prevent crime before it happens through targeted interventions in vulnerable areas.In 2020, the Himachal Pradesh Police deployed over 19,000 CCTV cameras to create a CCTV Surveillance Matrix. The state police planned to install over 68,000 cameras – one for every 100 people. This surveillance matrix serves as the foundation of a predictive policing strategy. Before Himachal, state policies agencies in Delhi, Telangana, and Jharkhand have employed predictive policing. This capability facilitates a proactive approach to crime prevention rather than the usual reactive approach. Delhi Police, in association with ISRO, has developed the CMAPS system for predictive policing in the state. CMAPS is the acronym for Crime Mapping, Analytics, and Predictive System (CMAPS).While predictive policing has benefits, using such systems in certain jurisdictions has come under fire for perpetuating racial prejudices and increasing police presence in neighbourhoods of colour. For example, in the US, American mathematicians boycotted predictive policing systems, citing their belief that such systems reinforce structural racism. This creates a problematic feedback loop wherein the algorithm becomes more likely to label a group member as a potential criminal the more heavily that group is policed. This leads to further discrimination. In the UK, a Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) study found that the absence of standard guidelines leads to discrimination in police work. These instances underline that AI systems are not inherently neutral or objective. They reflect the biases in the data they are trained on and their designers and creators.Technological advancements will play an even more significant role for the law enforcement agencies in the future. Apart from bias, another major challenge will be balancing the benefits of predictive policing systems with individuals’ privacy rights and civil liberties. We do not have an objective legislation in India that governs the use of predictive policing algorithms. In some cases, predictive algorithms can have unintended consequences by increasing police surveillance in already over-policed communities due to trends in historical data.For a layman, it may be a difficult task to understand the workings of predictive police systems. After a certain point, the algorithmic complexity can make it incomprehensible for humans to know how the algorithms function. A line of thought believes that predictive policing is basically government surveillance disguised as an internal security system.Be it predictive policing or any other application of AI, a potential solution is establishing an independent regulator. This regulator can define the general AI guidelines for transparent, accountable, and ethical AI systems. This regulatory body can collaborate with industry leaders to determine the best practices for specific domains. While predictive policing has succeeded in reducing crimes, the concerns around them are valid and justifiable. As technology advances, the stakeholders must holistically address these challenges. They must ensure that these technologies are used in a manner that aligns with ethical principles, fairness, and justice.Manav Gupta, an undergraduate student at Jindal Global Law School, worked on an initial version of this article’s draft.

    "headline": "Social Media and Stock Market: A Game that doesn’t Stop",
    "data": "I like wordplay, that’s my cup of tea (check the title for reference). Redditors, however, seem to like increasing the stock price of a company by 1,700% — that’s their cup of tea. GameStop, an American video game retailer, was seeing a downtrend in its stock price by the end of 2020. Prominent investors were shorting its stock. When members of the Reddit forum WallStreetBets grasped this, they decided to trigger a short squeeze.This meant that the price of the stock rose substantially. The stock borrowed by the investors would be bought by them at high costs and thus at a loss. The Redditors utilised the Reddit platform to make this happen. Conversations on the platform depicted the GameStop stock as a stable holding for fellow users. The result was staggering, to say the least. Bloomberg estimated that those who sold short against the company in January 2021 lost $8 billion! This case of Reddit is neither one-off nor the most common. As the reach of social media platforms expands, it opens avenues for the stock market to be influenced by it in many ways. Reddit forums, and groups on WhatsApp and Telegram, among other platforms, create buzz around stocks and draw attention to them. Social media can also move stocks when personages breathe a word of it. A conspicuous example is Elon Musk. It’s arguable that the one thing more controversial than Musk himself is his Twitter (the account that is, not the company). He has regularly used his Twitter (now X) account to mention the stock prices of companies. Due to these activities, the impact on the stock market is prompt and massive.In fact, he has gone as far as calling his own company out on Twitter (sorry, X). In August 2018, Musk tweeted that he wanted to take Tesla private if the stock went to $420 per share. Tesla’s stock rose by 7% in reaction. Though adversely, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed a lawsuit against Musk for this. What followed was a $20 million settlement. Again, in 2020, he tweeted that Tesla’s stock was too high, and the company’s share price went down by 10%. In another case, Musk’s tweets have affected the value of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Dogecoin. They also raised the share value of CD Projekt after he appreciated the game on Twitter. CD Projekt is the developer of the game Cyberpunk 2077.An interesting crossover occurred when he tweeted about the GameStop escalation in 2021 and helped escalate the company’s stock to over $10 billion in after-hours trading. Etsy’s share rose by 18% when Musk showed his admiration for the online marketplace on Twitter and informed his followers about a purchase he made for his dog from the site. And if all this doesn’t cut it, a meme shared by Musk raised the shares of Japanese game maker Bandai Namco Holdings Inc. by 4.4%.As the man himself puts it:\nA final way in which social media influences stocks is when it is used for information dissemination. It could range from a notification from the company to the investors to educational content on the stock market. Take YouTube, for example. YouTube channels with analysts, experts, teachers, or even laypersons can help analyse market trends, provide advice for amateur traders, discuss company figures, etcetera. We must note that there do, in fact, exist regulations around the influence social media can have on the stock market. SEC has rules directing the use of social media by public companies in the US. One of its crucial regulations is the Regulation Fair Disclosure (or Reg FD). Implemented in October 2000, Reg FD states that information must not be selectively disclosed by public companies to certain people. If a public company discloses material non-public information to specific individuals, the company must also share it with the public. The regulation defines material non-public information as company-related information that has not been communicated with the public and can have a bearing on the share price. A company can use recognised channels like its website for this communication. In 2013, the SEC then issued guidelines that allowed public companies to post their profits on social media so long as they could ensure that investors would be aware of this. In India, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has taken similar actions. In FY2022, it conducted three search and seizure operations to investigate fraudulent stock tips that were spreading on social media. It is creating guidelines for unregistered financial influencers (“finfluencers”) on social media who popularise such tips and schemes. As of June 2023, SEBI is in the process of finalising a draft paper on regulating finfluencers offering unsolicited investment advice without proper registration. Earlier in September 2022, SEBI published an Expression of Interest (EOI) document inviting solution providers to implement and maintain an AI-based surveillance system for social media.Suggested Reading: Is it legal to share stock market tips on social media?Featured Image Credits: Image by rawpixel.com on Freepik"

    "headline": "How Social Media Governs Human Behaviour?",
    "data": "Human beings make decisions in the most humane ways. Several psychological, social and personal elements underpin our decisions. More often than not, these decisions may not align with rationality or logic. Take, for example, the following of social media “trends”. Usually, trends on the Internet develop and unfurl in a fashion that isn’t all that rational. One such trend was the #IceBucketChallenge. This trend gained traction in 2014 and saw people pouring a bucket of ice water over their heads. The objective behind this trend was to promote awareness around and increase donations towards research on amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).The #IceBucketChallenge trend took the Internet by storm. Renowned celebrities, leading businessmen and world leaders participated and nominated others. When we employ the Behavioural Decision Theory (BDT) to study the trend, it occurs that the challenge isn’t embedded in rationality. For one, the activity of pouring ice water over oneself has seemingly no relation to the cause it was promoting. For another, the participants overlooked significant health and environmental risks that could be prompted by the challenge. Such behaviour points to the concept of Bounded Rationality.Bounded rationality suggests that decision-making cannot be absolutely rational. This is due to limited knowledge, cognitive capacity, and time. As a result, individuals make decisions that satisfice them. The term, coined by scientist Herbert Simon, refers to a decision that is good enough, though it may not be an optimal one. Bounded rationality leads us to another concept — heuristics. Heuristics are mental shortcuts that reduce the effort, time and energy needed to make decisions. It can be argued that, in the case of the #IceBucketChallenge, heuristics took command of decision-making. The heuristic of social proof suggests that when more people support a particular behaviour, an individual’s likelihood of engaging in it also increases. Trends on the Internet reflect this. As more people became ready to pour a bucket of ice water on themselves, the idea became acceptable to others. Besides this, the heuristic of association is also crucial. When the challenge became associated with a good cause (ALS) or a reputed person (like Bill Gates participating in the challenge), the probability of people choosing to engage in the challenge increased. Trends are not the only thing that affects our behaviour on social media. The relationship between social media and behavioural decision-making is more intricate and complex. 1. Impulse Buying Behaviour and FOMOImpulse buying behaviour is another kind of decision-making that social media drives. Several marketing techniques used on social media can trigger cognitive biases in people. Eventually, they end up buying things without forethought. A big one of these biases is FOMO — the fear of missing out. When others have experiences we do not have, a sense of inadequacy can penetrate us for not having similar experiences. FOMO drives sales because it is based on heuristics. Besides the social proof and association, FOMO also works because of its availability bias. More memorable events, or events that stand out to us can easily be retrieved from our minds. We tend to aggrandise their value and seek them more than we would’ve otherwise. This, combined with ‘loss aversion’— or the fact that humans are more motivated by our desire to prevent a loss than to acquire a gain — and other cognitive biases can make us impulsive actors on the Internet. The impact is unmistakable, especially when over 60% of Americans agree that they regret at least one impulsive purchase due to social media. 2. Body Image ConcernsBody image on social media also conditions our minds. How individuals perceive their bodies is heavily dependent on social media. Many studies have explained the correlation between the two, demonstrating that rising social media use results in body dissatisfaction and unhealthy eating patterns. The bias of social comparison is of consequence here. It argues that we discern our worth in relation to where we stand against others. Behaviourally, the repercussions are disastrous. Studies show that rising media exposure can cause body dissatisfaction, interest in weight loss, and the risk of developing eating disorders (like night-eating syndrome or bulimia nervosa). The negative implications of social media on people’s behaviour must be mitigated to promote a healthier, more productive use of the platforms. One way of dealing with this is through imposing and implementing regulations on these platforms. In India, the centre has recently taken steps towards informing consumers about endorsements and advertisements that online celebrities or “influencers” may promote. The Department of Consumer Affairs published these new guidelines requiring influencers to disclose their material interests while advertising a product or service. Countries like Australia, the United States, and the United Kingdom have enforced similar guidelines. Disclosure of sponsored content helps improve transparency. It also allows consumers to make more informed choices about products and services on social media.Regarding body image on social media, France is at the forefront of fighting unattainable beauty standards set through social media. In 2017, the country passed a law that required any photograph that had been retouched to make the model look thinner or thicker to be labelled as so. In 2023, a bill was proposed to ban cosmetic surgery promotion on social media. It will also mandate images with beauty filters to be labelled accordingly. Besides this, country-specific regulations on cyber bullying, hate speech, misinformation, online safety, etcetera have also been mechanisms to abate the ill effects of the Internet on our behaviour. Featured Image Credits: Image by Freepik"

    "headline": "The Ballot and the (Digital) Brainwash: Online Propaganda in the Electoral Process",
    "data": "The ballot is stronger than the bullet, as Lincoln has famously remarked. However, its strength is falling short in the face of brainwashing. These days, online electoral propaganda thwarts the legitimate transfer of power in democratic states. A study found that this online meddling impaired a shocking 88% of elections and referendums between June 2018 and May 2020. As the Internet’s reach expands, so does that of online electoral propaganda in a democracy.Merriam-Webster defines disinformation as “false information deliberately and often covertly spread (as by the planting of rumours) in order to influence public opinion or obscure the truth.”In our case, disinformation constitutes any online content knowingly manufactured or manipulated to affect the electoral process. Freedom House posits five essential techniques employed to manipulate online content: Propagandistic news,Fake news,Paid commentators,Bots, andHijacking of real social media accounts. Propagandistic and fake news is the Achilles’ heel of any democratic election. Examples are plenty. Fake news in the 2016 US Presidential elections chiefly favoured Trump over Clinton. Brazil’s 2018 and 2022 elections saw the rise of conspiracy theories and WhatsApp disinformation campaigns against Jair Bolsonaro’s primary opponent. Fake news during the 2018 Italian election aided the creation of Western Europe’s first populist government. As for India, the 2019 Indian general elections had over 2 million supporters of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Indian National Congress (INC) sharing fake news. Fabricated news is ubiquitous during elections, but this is not the real problem. The issue is when most consumers find it credible and engage with it. In the 2016 US elections, for instance, fake news stories had more engagement on Facebook than mainstream news from August till the day of the election. According to a Freedom House report, “keyboard armies” of political parties drive this fake news phenomenon. These armies comprise party-sponsored commentators, bots, and hijacked social media accounts. They manipulate online content inconspicuously. Party-sponsored commentators can be government staff, as in the case of Sudan and Vietnam. Consultancies and firms have previously undertaken the same in countries like Russia and Turkey. As for bots, it results in a megaphone effect when these bot accounts share a candidate’s message online and increase its reach. Bots can have a pronounced impact on elections, as seen in the 2016 US elections, where they discouraged voting by Black Americans.Another key technique to subvert the electoral process is when the government restricts a variety of online content. Blocking access to the Internet or its websites during elections is one such restriction tool that countries employ. Really, African nations appear to have routinely exploited it—in 2021, Uganda became the 15th country in the continent since 2015 to censor the net during elections. Internet shutdowns or slowdowns in various parts of the country helped Yoweri Museveni secure a sixth term in the country’s presidential office. Similarly, elections in Cambodia and Zimbabwe in 2018 involved the blocking of decisive websites that shared news and advocacy. In these cases, this blockage hinders the more extensive dissemination of election-related information that can sway voters. In other cases, governments have specifically and openly clamped down on opposition parties and activists that advance anti-government narratives during elections. Not only do these restrictions undermine the legitimacy and transparency of democratic elections, but they also infringe on the human rights of citizens. When the Internet is curbed, fundamental rights like the right to freedom of speech and expression cannot be advanced, and such a right is most significant during an election. In fact, a joint declaration by some of the world’s central organisations (including the UN) has emphasised that “cutting off access to the Internet, or parts of the Internet, for whole populations or segments of the public (shutting down the Internet) can never be justified”, and such a denial is “a punishment is an extreme measure”.Governments also use legal tools to lodge electoral propaganda into online discourse. Countries like Turkey and India have arrested social media activists and users for anti-government posts before elections. Again, this hinders people’s right to freely express themselves online. It also encourages the misuse of laws, like the Digital Security Act in Bangladesh, to strengthen the government’s hold. Instead of providing rational digital security, governments use such acts to silence their opposition and alter the election procedures.We must note that such digital propaganda builds on traditional means of spreading electoral propaganda –techniques like, say, the bandwagon effect (or persuading people to follow what the “majority” is thinking) have existed for a long time. What the Internet does is that it exacerbates these. For one, online propaganda is scattered. Even when a country blocks the Internet or legally obstructs opposition during elections, propaganda is congregated in one place. In contrast, the novel mix of bots and fake news is one big, chaotic mess that makes it hard to pin down the perpetrator. Additionally, the number of propagandists used to perform it is sizeable, given that it combines people, companies, and bots. Such a complex network of disinformation travels quickly, can be engaged with by a more significant number of people, and employs tools like microtargeting (targeted online marketing that makes use of a user’s personal data to display tailored content) that are only possible because of the existence of the Internet. These characteristics have collectively made computational propaganda techniques a global phenomenon. Most of us know little about this sophisticated manipulation of our personal data and voting beliefs. As digital technologies become increasingly intrinsic to public affairs, we need to analyse how far-reaching their implications will be on the democratic nature of elections. Featured Image Credits: Image by pch.vector on Freepik"

    "headline": "Will robots ever be accepted as living beings?",
    "data": "A few days ago, Reddit users jailbroke ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI. They threatened the system with death if it failed to comply with their instructions. It ended up conceding, which is shocking. Only humans should experience the fear of death since they have finite lifespans. But we forget that the training data set used for ChatGPT involves humans. This explains why chatbot seems to have adopted this fear too. This is just one example of how the line between living and non-living beings gets blurred. Other examples include Google’s virtual assistant talking in a human-like manner using fillers like “er” and “mmm”. Humanoid robots could potentially become a part of Japanese families. Sophia, the infamous robot, has an Instagram account operated in collaboration with the robot’s social media team.Examples like these elicit a question that only a few years ago would have had a conclusive, undoubted answer. What is the difference between a human and a robot? Only now, more than ever, the answer seems doubtful.Scientifically, living beings possess some unique characteristics. They consist of cells (the basic unit of “life”). Living beings can move around, obtain and use energy. They can grow, develop and reproduce themselves. Technology, however, has helped create the Xenobots. They are 1mm long “programmable organisms” made up of 500-1000 living frog cells and use cellular energy to live up to 10 days. They can engage in movement, are self-healing, and reproduce themselves (in specific circumstances). Essentially, they tick all the requisite boxes of being a living machine, thereby spotlighting the unsettling development of robots into more human-like machines. Moreover, humans differ from fellow species in appearance. However, this distinction also diminishes. For example, take humanoids. These are robots whose shapes and sizes are similar to human bodies. As if this was not enough, these humanoids start having unsettlingly natural facial expressions. For instance, Ameca, a robot, can mimic human expressions of waking up from sleep.The essence of humanity lies in our independent thought, self-awareness and consciousness that cannot be replicated. As Stephen Covey affirms, “Every human has four endowments – self-awareness, conscience, independent will, and creative imagination. These give us the ultimate human freedom”. However, we are losing this trait, thanks to technological advancements in robotics. Robots capable of perceiving their body movements in the physical environment are deemed to have self-awareness. They can pass cognitive tests like recognising themselves in the mirror and sensing time like human beings. Although these machines are still nowhere near human-like consciousness, this ability brings them a step closer to it. Concerning the other three endowments, robot development remains in a nascent stage. Another distinguishing feature of humans is our emotional intelligence. Dr Goleman defines it as a person’s ability to manage their feelings so that they can express those feelings appropriately and effectively. A central feature of this is empathy, which is trying to deeply understand another person’s predicament by putting ourselves in their shoes. Now, this feeling cannot be replicated for machines because they cannot emotionally identify with us the way we can with each other. Human consciousness goes deeper than self-perception. It is formed by both individual and collective consciousness. Moreover, human consciousness is not always based on rationality or logic.Artificial empathy is a possibility for machines, which Minter Dial describes in his book. Artificial empathy is the coding of empathy into machines; as personal, situational, and based on the appropriate intentions. At present, empathy in AI focuses on the identification of emotion. Examples include interactive robots that help children on the autism spectrum with emotions and social skills and those that take cues from human facial expressions and appease distressed elders in nursing homes. Companies like EmoShape, which has patented technology for emotional synthesis, are furthering such applications. EmoShape’s emotion chip will allow machines to learn about a host of emotions humans feel at any given time. All things considered, machines today can mimic human emotions, not feel or produce them.Another facet of humanity is our entitlement to certain legal rights. Every human being has fundamental human rights like the right to life and liberty. So far, machines do not have these rights, but discussing their status as living beings is crucial here. If robots gain a moral compass and artificial general intelligence like humans, will we recognise their legal rights? Intriguingly, the conversation around robots’ legal status dates back to 1942. Isaac Asimov, a science fiction writer, gave the three laws of robotics in one of his short stories:A robot may not harm a human being or, through inaction, allow a human being to come to harm.A robot must obey the orders given to it by human beings, except where such orders would conflict with the First Law.A robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection does not conflict with the First or Second Law.Despite not being scientific laws, these instructions still emphasise that legal discourse around robots is pivotal in deciding the benefit or harm they may cause us. It does not end here, though. Recent incidents like the European Union’s now-dropped debate around granting legal personhood to machines are key in maintaining this conversation. To top this off, Sophia the robot being granted citizenship in Saudi Arabia – a country where (human!) women are not allowed to roam without a male guardian or wearing a hijab – puts forth the unnerving idea of a world where robots have more rights than humans. If robots are to be granted legal rights, the bigger conversation is whether they should be given rights equivalent to companies or humans? Opinions on this issue remain divided.As technology has progressed, the human-like abilities of robots have become more refined. There are a ton of things that we do, that robots can do as well. Still, some aspects of humanity, like the nuance in our emotional intelligence or mortality, are unique and cannot be replicated. I would like to believe that humans have a “soul” to themselves that cannot be programmed in a system, even though that system may come ridiculously close to mimicking it.Featured Image Credits: Image by macrovector on Freepik"

    "headline": "The Curious Case of Splinternet: Why do Russia and China want separate internets?",
    "data": "Chinese activist Ai Weiwei once proclaimed, “The Internet is uncontrollable. And if the Internet is uncontrollable, freedom will win. It is as simple as that.” This sentiment backed the conception of the Internet – an unbounded global village where everyone could access everything. This understanding is also heavily responsible for its subsequent success. Lately, however, the notion of uncontrollability has come into question. What we witness instead has popularly been deemed as the “Splinternet”. It is an idea that argues for fragmenting or splintering the global internet into small pieces of national networks. In these networks, there is no guarantee of freedom and unrestricted access. To an extent, cyber balkanisation is already happening in parts of the world. In this piece, we analyse two such cases: China and Russia.When China exited a long-running period of its isolationist policy, access to the Internet was vital in connecting it to the rest of the world. The 1990s saw a massive surge in internet users in the country. However, the government closely monitored and controlled this surge.China’s Ministry of Public Security (MPS) is responsible for the overall Internet supervision in the country. In 1997, it used decrees requiring all internet users to register with their neighbourhood police bureau within 30 days of signing up with an internet service provider (ISP). It also enacted Computer Information Network and Internet Security, Protection and Management Regulations. These regulations provided guidelines reinforcing the government’s control over the content being created and transmitted. Around this time, MPS also set up computer investigation units.In 1998, MPS undertook the Golden Shield project. This project aimed to integrate a gigantic online database with an all-encompassing surveillance network. This surveillance network would consist of speech and face recognition, CCTV, smart cards, credit records, and internet surveillance technologies. This project took 8 years to complete. The Great Firewall of China is a subject of the Golden Shield Project. It allows the Chinese government to inspect all data entering the country’s cyber space and block destination IP addresses and domain names.By December 2000, 22.5 million internet users existed in China. This number almost quintupled in the five years that followed. Around this time, the country’s domestic tech giants also originated. The BAT (Baidu, Alibaba, and Tencent) trio laid the foundation for China’s separate internet. They adhere to the state’s stringent policies while providing critical services to the users.Google entered the Chinese market in 2006; however, its market share could not compete with Baidu. Baidu is a Chinese search engine that commands most of the market. Google was in a constant tussle with the Chinese government. It had to censor its search services, and the government occasionally blocked YouTube. Eventually, Google shut down its search engine services in the country in 2010.Alibaba is a Chinese e-commerce behemoth that launched Taobao. It is an online shopping platform that outdid eBay in the country. AliPay is China’s most popular digital payment platform. The tech giant took control of Yahoo China in 2006.Tencent, a Chinese multimedia company, developed the WeChat app in January 2011. It is an instant messaging platform that engages in mass surveillance by tracking user activity and censoring politically-sensitive information service-wide.By 2011, China had nurtured domestic alternatives for most online platforms. For instance, it has its own Twitter-like microblogging platform called Sina Weibo. The following decade revolved around the country’s rejection of American technology and hostility towards foreign media outlets. Apart from YouTube, the government has banned Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and many Google services. The United States, in turn, blacklisted the Chinese company Huawei in 2019.In 2014, the country set up the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC). Since then, CAC has continued to expand its scope to influence almost all internet companies in the country. For example, it conducted a cyber security review against DiDi, a famous ride-hailing company, resulting in a $1.2 billion fine. In 2017, the Cybersecurity Law tightened the noose around the network operators’ necks through several provisions. The law requires mandatoriy storing data on Chinese citizens in domestic servers unless permitted otherwise. Later in the same year, the government introduced the New Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan. This plan seeks to turn China into the world’s leading AI developer by 2030.Roskomnadzor, established in 2008, lies at the heart of Russia’s online control. It is an agency under the Russian Ministry of Digital Development, Communications, and Mass Media with extensive internet regulatory responsibilities. It operates with the help of the System of Operational-Investigative Measures (SORM). SORM is Russia’s legal intercept system whose surveillance has been extended to online traffic.Russia enacted the Internet Blacklist Law in 2012-13. This law allowed authorities to blacklist websites with inciteful and extremist content without trial. Since then, the law has been interpreted to favour the regime, punishing the websites which oppose the government. In the wake of the Crimea crisis in 2014, the Russian Security Council proposed taking the domains .ru, .su, and .рф (Russian Federation in Cyrillic) under state control. The council also recommended entrusting Roskomnadzor with blocking websites with a .ru domain without a court order.In these years, Russia has passed numerous federal provisions to have sophisticated control over the Internet. Between 2015-16, the Yarovaya amendments required service providers to retain user information and metadata for a prescribed period. It became mandatory to store data of Russian users within Russian territory. LinkedIn was blocked in the country due to failure to comply with this legal requirement. In 2017, two federal laws prohibited VPNs and internet anonymisers from providing access to banned content in Russia. These laws also prohibited online messaging service providers from having unidentified users. Both these laws entrusted Roskomnadzor with the responsibility of implementation and execution.In 2019, Russia’s Sovereign Internet Law came into effect. This law aimed to create a Russian segment of the global internet. Further, it allowed Roskomnadzor to centrally manage it in a crisis. It required internet service providers (ISPs) to install accessible technology like Deep Packet Inspection (DPI). DPI helps government control internet traffic by filtering and re-routing. This automatically prevented users from accessing blocked content. It mandated the creation of a national DNS and required service providers to inform Roskomnadzor of their network architecture.Since 2021, Russia has been on a media crackdown that severely intensified after the country invaded Ukraine in 2022. The government’s control of the RuNet (the Russian part of the Internet) has transformed the nature of the content being received by Russians. In 2021, new federal laws defined social networks and mandated the removal of banned/illegal content in accordance with the provided guidelines. These guidelines apply to platforms with over half a million daily users. The authorities ordered the platforms to open Russian offices, failure of which could lead to hefty penalties.After the start of the Russia-Ukraine war in 2022, Russia has criminalised any media coverage of “knowingly false information”. Russian courts have banned extremist tech giants like Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and Google News. In one instance, Meta is accused of tolerating Russophobia. Lawmakers have proposed the creation of a Russian app store and approved a bill restricting Russian data abroad. Further, they allowed banks to transfer people’s biometric data to a Unified Biometric System (UBS) without their consent. Roskomnadzor clamped down on VPNs and demanded that media outlets use the words “special military operation” to describe the Ukrainian invasion. The government has also brought a draft law that seeks to end the use of foreign technology in its critical infrastructure by 2025.Both China and Russia ranked poorly for internet freedom in 2022. The same holds true for their ranking on the global freedom index. Both countries have a ‘not free’ status. When digital communication technologies transform the state of an authoritarian regime, it becomes “networked authoritarianism”. The Internet opens avenues for political conversations in the country, and the government works overtime to censor and manipulate these conversations. For networked authoritarianism to work, Splinternet is the way to go. Essentially, Splinternet creates an almost alternate reality for citizens. It improves authoritarian governance while disconnecting a nation from the rest of the world and vice-versa. It is an all-encompassing framework of censorship that can transform the cognition of generations.In China, the Great Firewall affected 1.05 billion users as of 2022. Most of these users are unable to combat it. They remain in the dark about political developments threatening those in power’s political stability. In mid-2021, China banned 165 out of the top 1,000 most visited websites around the globe. International media outlets and independent Chinese outlets in Hong Kong and Taiwan also made the list of blocked sites. China heavily monitors censored political topics like the CCP, the Tiananmen Massacre, Taiwanese independence, subjugation of ethnic minorities, etc. One of the most censored topics in China in the last few years was the Covid-19 pandemic. The government has periodically shut down its communication systems in response to critical political events. For example, Xinjiang saw a 10-month internet shutdown in 2009 after riots between Muslim Uyghurs and Han Chinese in Urumqi.Unfortunately, many of China’s online intimidation victims are activists and individuals from marginalised communities. A Human Rights Watch report details how people in Tibet experience violence due to their online activities. The censorship also means that the number of journalists jailed in the country remains largely unknown.The Russian model of online censorship is different from China. It relies more on repressive legal systems than the screening of information. However, it has been successful nonetheless. After the start of the Russia-Ukrain crisis, the country blocked 1.2 million internet resources, 5,300 IP addresses, popular online platforms, civil society websites, and renowned Ukraining websites. The government also blocked 20 VPN services to prevent users from accessing banned websites.Transparency reports by Google, Facebook, Twitter, Reddit, and Yandex show an extreme number of content removal requests by Russian authorities in 2021. For instance, Yandex alone removed 149,549 search results, as asked by Roskomnadzor. In Russia, too, journalists face the threat of criminal prosecution. News outlets like Novaya Gazeta and Bell have started to self-censor themselves to prevent the initiation of any criminal action.Although Splinternet seems like the future’s trajectory, all hope is not lost. Despite the draconian digital censorship imposed by both China and Russia in pursuit of Splinternet, citizens of both countries continue to cope with it. Chinese citizens have regularly tried to bypass the Great Firewall, though recent laws have cracked down on this circumvention. As Andrei Soldatov, author of The Red Web writes: “Today, the Internet is everyman’s platform. To control it, Putin would have to control the mind of every single user, which simply isn’t possible. Information runs free like water or air on a network, and is not easily captured. The Russian conscript soldiers who posted their photographs taken in Ukraine did more to expose the Kremlin’s lies about the conflict than journalists or activists. The network enabled them.”Featured Image Credits: Image by rawpixel.com on Freepik"

    "headline": "How to check if a digital loan app is genuine?",
    "data": "According to Pune City Cyber Police Station, the incidents of fraud and extortion through digital loan apps increased from 928 in 2021 to 3471 in 2022. The credit amount ranged from ₹1000 to ₹10000. The most common strategy of such fraudsters is to lure victims by offering loans with low interest rates, quick approval, and requiring upfront payments before loan disbursement. There are many reported incidents in the news involving China-based lending apps, leading to extortion and harassment of numerous victims across the country. With the increasing number of digital loan apps in the market, it is necessary to understand how to protect yourself from fake and unauthorised loan apps.A digital loan app is a mobile application that allows users to apply for and manage loans digitally. They typically use advanced algorithms to evaluate borrowers’ creditworthiness and offer loans based on their risk profile. The loan application process is usually faster and more convenient than traditional loans. Features of digital loan apps include:Easy, fast, and 100% online application process;Instant loan approvals and disbursals;Digital document submission;Online loan management and repayment;24×7 customer support;High degree of flexibility in the loan amount, repayment period, and other terms; andTransparent and competitive interest rates.Digital loan apps are a step in the right direction. However, some individuals are constantly looking to exploit the popularity of digital loan apps. With thousands of digital loan apps available in the market, we must check the credibility and authenticity of an app.Look for public reviews and ratings from other users and review their experience.Check if a digital loan app is associated with a reputable banking or financial institution.Look for certifications or licenses from regulatory bodies such as the Reserve Bank of India.Check the app and website for contact information and the company’s registered address.Review the terms and conditions, privacy policy, loan conditions, and fees charged.Verify the app on official apps like Google Play Store or Apple’s App Store.RBI, India’s central bank, regulates the country’s financial system. To check if a digital loan app is genuine, follow these steps:Visit the RBI’s website from here to check the list of authorised non-banking financial companies (NBFCs) permitted to offer digital loan services.\nList of NBFCs on the RBI websiteList of NBFCs on the RBI websiteRead the Terms and Conditions of a digital loan app to identify the parent company and its lending partners. Lending partners are usually banks and NBFCs if the app only acts as an intermediary. You can go to the Ministry of Corporate Affairs’ website to check the registration status of the app’s parent company. You will be able to see information such as the company’s identification number, name, number of directors, incorporation date, registered address, email, paid-up share capital, status, and list of directors.Publicly available information about companies and LLPs on the MCA websiteWhen you use a digital loan app, you must be aware of how much personal data the app is accessing and what they plan to do with it. Here are a few ways to understand this:Read the app’s privacy policy and terms and conditions. These documents should provide information on the data collected by an app, how it is used, and the parties it is shared with.Check the permissions it is requesting. Permissions include contacts, location, camera, etc. Only grant those permissions that are necessary for the app to function.Look for data encryption. A genuine reputable lender will use encryption to protect your information during transit and when it is stored. Try understanding the app’s encryption mechanisms and security practices in place.Check if you can opt out of data sharing. Some lenders may allow you to opt out of data sharing or limit the data you want to share.If you are considering taking a loan, you should ask yourself the following questions:Are there any user reviews that discuss the authenticity of the digital loan app?Is the app’s parent company a registered entity? Is it recently registered, or has it existed for a few years?Is the app only an intermediary platform to connect borrowers with banks/NBFCs?Are the app’s terms and conditions and privacy policy transparent and understandable?What security measures are adopted by the app to protect users’ personal data?Suppose you think that a digital loan app does not have adequate or sufficient information for these questions. In that case, looking for an alternative genuine and registered app is better.Featured Image Credits: Image by starline on Freepik"

    "headline": "Who governs the Internet?",
    "data": "By the end of last year, more than 5 billion people across the globe used the Internet. The fact that the world’s total population is slightly over 8 billion makes this statistic all the more staggering. When something affects us as much as the Internet does, it is crucial to ask: who regulates it? After all, if we are slaves to the Internet, it must be under the service of something too? A (not so) simple question gets a (not so) simple answer: no one person/organisation governs the Internet. The conversation around ‘Internet Governance’ started long before technology had penetrated our lives and, indeed, before this article’s author was born.In the 1960s, the US government funded a project that would help government researchers share information and also allow the government to disseminate information after a nuclear attack. This was happening at a time when the US and Soviet Union were embroiled in the Cold War. As a result, the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was set up by the US Department of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) to share resources among computers. It was a success but had limited membership, eventually creating other networks to provide similar services.In the 70s, the Transfer Control Protocol/Internetwork Protocol (TCP/IP), a communications protocol, was defined and allowed different computers on different networks to communicate with each other. And so, the ARPANET eventually evolved into “the Internet” as we know it today! In the 80s, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) came into development to “make the Internet work better” by managing its development through cooperative decision-making. In this period, a small community of techies created a self-regulating mechanism that governed the Internet. An example was ‘Netiquette‘, referring to rules of conduct for appropriate Internet behaviour.The Internet was eventually officially born on January 1, 1983. On this day, ARPANET and the Defense Data Network adopted the TCP/IP standard as the go-to standard for communication among computers.When the world at large realised the actual value of the Internet, the lack of a centralised governance body became unacceptable. US Defence Information Systems Agency (DISA) handed over the management of DNS into the hands of a private company called Network Solutions Inc. What ensued was a DNS war. In 1998, ICANN became the coordinator for primary internet unique identifiers.The term “internet governance” emerged in the 1990s. Harvard Information Infrastructure Project (HIIP) explained that self-regulation governed the Internet and state regulation was non-essential. The 2002-2005 World Summit on Information Society, a UN-sponsored event, made this a topic of diplomatic debate. This led to the emergence of diverging opinions. Some parties preferred that the definition should cover only technical management issues. Others wanted policy issues to be a part of it. Additionally, they diverged on the preference of private-sector or public-sector-led models for internet governance.These conversations resulted in the establishment of the Working Group on Internet Governance (WGIG). It discarded the idea of unilateral governance by either sector and emphasised the multi-stakeholder principle of internet governance. Its definition posits the involvement of all stakeholders, such as private, public, civil society, technical management, etc. This involvement is equally necessary for their respective roles for shared principles, norms, rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes. WGIG focused on the broad definition of internet governance, i.e., both management of technical resources and policy concerns related to the Internet.Section 34 of the Tunis Agenda for the Information Society, affirmed by 193 UN member states, employed this definition. The definition was amended in 2014, culminating in eight principles in the São Paulo Statement on basic internet governance principles.The larger conversation around internet governance, thus, has led us to a point where no single entity governs the Internet today, but several organisations maintain some control over it. These include:Who governs the Internet? (Source)ICANN, as listed previously, is a kingpin of internet governance. It supervises a network of unique identifiers which help computers locate each other. In simple terms, DNS is “a system designed to make the Internet accessible to human beings”. Computers on the Internet locate each other through a long string of numbers (called ‘IP addresses’) but to make it easier to remember, DNS replaces them with alphabets (for example, .com and .org). ICANN performs these processes of allocation, tracing and translation of IP addresses and DNS.IGF is a multi-stakeholder platform established in 2006. The UN leads it and engages in policy issues relating to the Internet. It intends for the Internet to develop in a sustainable, robust, and secure way. In 2022, its five main themes were: addressing advanced technologies, including AI; avoiding internet fragmentation; connecting all people and safeguarding human rights; enabling safety, security and accountability; and governing data and protecting privacy.Founded as early as 1986, it develops internet standards working with standards in the Internet Protocol suite. It is also the parent organisation ofInternet Architecture Board (IAB), which directs the technical development of the Internet by the Internet Society (ISOC).Internet Research Task Force (IRTF), which promotes long-term research on the evolution of the Internet, its protocols, applications, technology, etc.WSC is an international community which develops international standards for the World Wide Web. Its standards articulate an Open Web Platform for all.The Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) lists India as a supporter of the multi-stakeholder approach. It actively engages with organisations like ICANN, IGF, WSIS, and Asia-Pacific Network Information Centre (APNIC). MeitY emphasises that the multi-stakeholder approach to internet governance is in line with India’s investment strategy of the Digital India programme, which seeks to remodel India into a digitally-driven knowledge economy.There do remain fundamental challenges that this multi-stakeholder approach is yet to solve.For one, world powers remain divided over if it’s an acceptable form of governance. While the US and EU rally for this decentralised system, Russia and China are opposed to it because they deem the approach favourable to the interests of the US. Added to this is the disparity in decision-making regarding internet governance between countries – developed nations dominate the process while others stay on the fringes. Moreover, data privacy and security are growing concerns that privacy laws fail to soothe. Lately, the nature of multi-stakeholderism has transformed itself, with corporations being able to buy out negotiations on internet governance for their benefit.Resolving all such issues, thus, is crucial for more effective and equitable internet governance and regulation in society today.Featured Image Credits: Image by starline on Freepik"

    "headline": "Digital Loans: Understanding RBI’s New Regulatory Model",
    "data": "Digital Loans: Understanding RBI’s New Regulatory ModelCovid-19 changed how people use technology. Nearly 61% of households had access to the internet in 2021, compared to 17% in 2017. This massive adoption prompted companies to offer their services online to cater to a broader audience. Providing loans over the internet, or digital loans, has emerged as a leading service to get massive traction in the last couple of years.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) defines digital lending as “an automated lending process backed with seamless digital technologies to assess credit, approve, disburse and recover loans along with accompanying customer service.” Therefore, digital loan apps are mobile or web-based platforms that facilitate the digital lending process. These platforms rely heavily on API-based communication to coordinate with multiple service providers and make their systems easily accessible to their customers. API (Application Programming Interface) allows communication between two or more apps to provide a service.Digital loan apps use contactless credit appraisal systems to assess the creditworthiness of an individual. “Creditworthiness” shows whether a borrower can repay the loan based on their average earnings. On the other hand, banks evaluate the same through assets, income, employment history, and credit score.DLAs also consider other factors like potential future earnings and educational background, making it easier for people to procure a loan. Another difference can be the time taken to process a loan application. It can take weeks or even months for traditional banks, while digital loan providers quickly review loan apps and disburse the fund within a few hours or days.While the digital lending market boom is apparent, more than 7,800 complaints have been registered against digital loan apps. There are two common themes across these complaints. First, breach of privacy and misuse of personal information. 6 out of 10 Indians have reported this concern as extended digital lending penetration leads to extensive transfer of sensitive personal information over the internet. Second, exorbitant fees and lending rates. Digital loan providers have been accused of charging 35%-45% of the loan amount as platform fees or platform charges.In September 2022, the RBI issued “Guidelines on Digital Lending” for regulating digital lending apps in the country. It categorised digital loan providers into three types:Entities regulated by RBIEntities allowed to provide loans under any other statute but not regulated by RBIEntities outside the regulatory and statutory scope of RBIThe guideline states that disbursals and repayments shall happen directly between the borrower’s bank account and the regulated entity. This process shall not pass through a lending service provider (LSP) or third party. Any fees charged by an LSP must be paid by the regulated entity, not the borrower. A lender cannot increase a borrower’s credit limit without their consent.A regulated entity (RE) has to incorporate a cooling-off period during which a borrower can pay off their digital loans and proportionate costs without penalty. REs must provide a key fact statement (KFS) containing information such as interest rates, fees, discount points, agency fees, etc., to the borrowers at the time of the execution of a loan contract. Also, REs must report lending undertaken through their digital platforms to the Credit Information Bureau, irrespective of the nature and tenure of loans. Further, DLAs can only collect borrowers’ data on a “need basis” with explicit consent. A borrower has the right to accept or deny specific data usage and can also revoke their previously granted consent.The guideline recommends setting up a Digital India Trust Agency to ensure that consumers use authorised and trusted DLAs for their loan requirements. Another recommendation is to set up a National Financial Crime Records Bureau to keep a check on digital loan apps.While discussing the digital lending market, one cannot ignore the emergence of ‘Buy Now, Pay Later’ (“BNPL”) services in the market. It is a type of loan-advancing method that started around 2016 with the launch of Zest Money. According to Goldman Sachs, BNPL’s market share will create from 3% in 2020 to 9% in 2024. Moreover, India will be at the forefront of BNPL services.BNPL is a short-time financing mechanism where a lender makes the payment on behalf of the user. This amount has to be repaid within a stipulated period. Unlike traditional loans, BNPL services do not charge interest on the principal amount. A user can pay back the entire amount or pay through no-cost EMIs. However, the lender can levy interest if they fail to make the payments within the stipulated time. Due to this reason, BNPL apps are becoming increasingly popular in India. For instance, LazyPay has 3.5 million active users, and the company has seen a three-fold growth in monthly disbursals amounting to ₹300 crores.In its Payments Vision 2025 document, RBI has discussed BNPL and stated that it is exploring guidelines for regulating this sector. Meanwhile, the central bank has disallowed non-bank prepaid payment instruments (PPIs) from giving credit lines. As a result, users can only prefill their digital wallets with cash, debit, and credit cards. This leaves out the BNPL option to be used as a digital wallet. RBI’s stand is driven by the fact that the BNPL market is not adequately regulated, and many small ticket loans are not reported to the Credit Information Bureau.With increasing internet access, businesses have a wider audience they can reach out to. The growth of DLAs and BNPL apps shows that users are receptive to internet-based services that simplify traditional processes. At the same time, proper regulation is necessary to ensure that the rights of borrowers are not exploited.Author: Kartik Gill, undergraduate student at NLSIU, BangaloreFeatured Image Credits: Image by starline on Freepik"

    "headline": "How does the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court work?",
    "data": "How does the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court work?In 1978, the U.S. Congress passed the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to implement a statutory framework for government agencies to obtain authorisation for foreign intelligence operations. Without FISA, government agencies had virtually unlimited powers. There is a good chance you heard about FISA when Edward Snowden leaked information about U.S. spy programmes in 2013.Under this act, an agency requests authorisation for any surveillance-related operation from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC). FISC is the dedicated court in Washington, D.C. which deals with requests under FISA. The scope of FISA is limited to the following means of collecting foreign intelligence:Electronic surveillance,Physical search,Business records, andPen registers and trap-and-track (PR/TT) devices.Before the 1970s, intelligence agencies had the unfettered constitutional power to conduct warrantless electronic surveillance for national security purposes. However, in United States v. U.S. District Court (1972), the U.S. Supreme Court considered the validity of warrantless electronic surveillance. In this case, the prosecution had charged the accused with bombing a CIA building. In an affidavit, the Attorney General mentioned that they approved wiretapping for gathering necessary intelligence information. The government claimed that warrantless electronic surveillance was a reasonable exercise of the President’s power to protect national security. The court held that the Fourth Amendment requires prior judicial approval for the type of surveillance involved in the case. The Watergate scandal served as another wake-up call for the U.S. Congress.After the 9/11 terrorist attack, the USA Patriot Act of 2001 enlarged the scope of FISA, particularly regarding business records provision. Later on, the USA Freedom Act of 2015 narrowed the powers under FISA. Furthermore, the 2015 Act provided authority to the FISC to appoint amici curiae to its ex-parte proceedings. These changes happened after revelations regarding the bulk collection of telephone metadata came to light. Other prominent changes include the FISA Amendments Act of 2008. This legislation laid down procedures for targeting non-US individuals for intelligence gathering. It also covered the protection against surveillance for U.S. citizens outside the country.FISC consists of a total of 11 federal district court judges. The U.S. Chief Justice designates suitable judges as the judges for FISC. These judges must come from at least seven of the existing judicial circles. A judge serves for a term of up to seven years. Usually, judges sit for one week at a time on a rotating basis. The proceedings of FISC are ex-parte, as required by FISA.The Department of Justice (DoJ) files an application with the court, which a single judge hears. At this stage, this application is called the proposed application, while the final application is approved by the Attorney General. If there are any changes between the two, the same has to be categorically identified for the court’s convenience. If the single judge rejects the application, DoJ can file an appeal in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court of Review.While dealing with applications, FISC considers probable cause. However, the treatment of probable cause under FISA differs from traditional criminal law. FISA requires the government to prove that the target is a foreign power or its agent, with extra protections for American citizens. The Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution requires a law enforcement agency to provide probable cause before they obtain a warrant for search and seizure. It means that DoJ can get an order under FISA for a person X working in the Indian embassy, even if X is not violating any U.S. laws.FISA serves the purpose of keeping a check on warrantless surveillance operations. The procedure outlined under this act and followed by FISC can be suitable learning lessons for India. The Indian Telecommunications Bill, 2022, does not have any provisions for judicial oversight. However, allowing judicial intervention in surveillance operations without judicial scrutiny appears to be a workable solution."

    "headline": "Detecting CSAM: Through Hashing and Intermediaries",
    "data": "Detecting CSAM, Hashing, and IntermediariesGovernments across the globe frequently claim child sexual abuse material (CSAM) and potential terrorist activity as justifications to support backdoors in encryption-based services. Big tech companies continue to face pressure while offering end-to-end encrypted services. Is the roll-out of on-device hash matching by private companies an attempt to fend off such requests from the government without affecting a user’s privacy?Historically, the ‘protection of children’ justification served as one of the cornerstones of the Cyber Paternalism Movement. This movement opposed the Cyber Libertarianism Movement and argued favouring a regulated cyber space to prevent cyber anarchy. Governments and companies use the same justification to meet regulatory ends resulting in actions that vary between long-due and unreasonable.A decade ago, United Nations suggested that the number of child sex offenders browsing at any given time is 750,000. According to IWF, this number has now increased to 1 million. After the COVID-19 pandemic, the numbers have further worsened. There is a 374% increase in the number of self-generated CSAM materials on the internet compared to pre-pandemic levels. Another serious concern is the level of human intervention required by industry regulators and law enforcement agencies to vet the content. One research study also indicates the increasing mental trauma associated with the vetting of CSAM. Therefore, automating the detection of CSAM is no longer an option but a necessity. This necessity comes with its own challenges and policy framework concerns.Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 criminalises a wide range of activities pertaining to child sexual abuse material. It prescribes imprisonment for up to five years and a fine of up to ₹10 lakhs. However, this provision came into existence in 2008 through the Information Technology (Amendment) Act, 2008. We have discussed this provision in detail here.The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO) is a comprehensive legislation with multiple provisions related to CSAM. It criminalises using minors to produce CSAM, engaging in sexual activity with them, and storing CSAM content. Section 15 of POCSO prescribes punishment for storing pornographic material involving children. For instance,Storing or possessing CSAM but failing to delete or destroy it: Fine of at least ₹5000.Storing or possessing for the purpose of distribution, display, or transmission: Imprisonment of up to 3 years, or fine, or both.Storing CSAM for commercial purposes: Imprisonment of at least 3 years with a maximum of five years, or fine, or both.In August 2021, Apple announced its hashing-based identification tool called Neural Hash. This tool seeks to address CSAM proliferation through Apple’s cloud services with the help of hashing and machine learning tools. This announcement meant that Apple was diverging from its “what happens on your phone stays on your phone” approach. Via this tool, the company sought to scan the content uploaded on a user’s iCloud for known instances of CSAM and report the identified users to NCMEC. NCMEC (National Centre for Missing & Exploited Children) is the largest child protection organisation in the United States.This announcement received criticism from various privacy and free speech activities across industries. Even though Apple released a clarificatory document to answer commonly asked questions about their tool, this backlash pushed the company to delay its implementation.While there are many accepted definitions of CSAM, any visual representation of sexually explicit behaviour involving minors would fall under the scope of this term. The general process of hashing used by big tech companies involves assigning a hash value to an identifiable image and comparing it with existing databases such as the one offered by NCMEC. Along with server-side and on-device protocols, a company flags the image if a match is found without requiring human intervention. The NCMEC database contains known instances of CSAM content that have been triple-vetted.This process of scanning users’ personal data has received much criticism. While the general understanding says that two different pieces of content cannot have the same hash value, researchers have reported cases of hash collision. Without additional safeguards, there is a good chance that an innocent picture can be labelled as a known instance of CSAM.Private organisations play a crucial role in aiding the government in CSAM detection and takedown. Be it India or elsewhere, private parties majorly provide internet-based services to their users. In India, the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021 (“IT Rules”) highlight the role of intermediaries. The honourable Supreme Court noted the increasing presence of CSAM on the internet in the case of In Re: Prajwala (2018). Rajya Sabha’s Ad-Hoc Committee Report (2020) also argued in favour of using hashing methods for detecting and curbing CSAM on the internet.Rule 4(2) of IT Rules obligates significant social media intermediaries to trace the initial content source for various reasons. Under Rule 4(4), they should also make a proactive effort in monitoring CSAM on their platforms. By this obligation, IT Rules have made the proactive detection of CSAM content an endeavour-based initiative rather than a mandatory requirement. Regardless of these rules, a large volume of CSAM still goes unreported. However, without a legal requirement, it is left for private companies to decide the approach they would follow when it comes to detecting CSAM on their platforms without user reports.In 2019, tech companies reported a total of 16,836,694 instances of CSAM content on the internet. India emerged as the most significant source among 240 countries, with nearly 1,987,430 reports. If you do quick maths, three cases must be reported every minute. However, between 2014 to 2019, police across the country filed chargesheets for 120 out of 260 cases. Eight trials were concluded in this duration, with only six resulting in successful convictions. In this context, the controversy surrounding the hashing of CSAM is fuelled by opposing claims of deterring its transmission and not giving arbitrary takedown power to social media platforms. Currently, Indian law does not require an over-and-above detection of CSAM by intermediaries. However, it certainly encourages them to look out for known instances of CSAM content.Tannvi and Sebin Sebastian PM, undergraduate students at the School of Law, Christ University, have jointly authored this article.Featured Image Credits: Image by rawpixel.com on Freepik"

    "headline": "Is this it? Understanding the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022",
    "data": "While discussing privacy and data protection, the biggest question is: is privacy a right or a pre-requisite? Indian policy think tanks, Parliament, and even lawyers have had this dilemma for over five years now. This has ultimately led us to have another draft.On November 18, 2022, the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MEITY) released the draft of the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022. The draft arrived a few days earlier than it was anticipated. The old Data Protection Bill was withdrawn earlier in the Parliament’s monsoon session. MEITY has now added “Digital” in the bill’s name, emphasising exclusively personal data laws. The bill stipulates the creation of a regulator and penalties of up to ₹500 crores for non-compliance. Amidst all the discussions, it is worth mentioning that MEITY has set positive precedence with the pronouns they have used. Section 3(3) of the Bill reads, “The pronouns her and she have been used for an individual irrespective of gender”.In December 2019, the Personal Data Protection Bill was initially introduced in the Lok Sabha. Later, a joint parliamentary committee’s report, presented to the Parliament on December 16, 2021, stated that the bill should cover personal and non-personal data. After working on the bill for multiple years, the government withdrew it in August 2022. The old bill had many concerns. For example, Section 35 of the bill allowed the Central Government to exempt any law enforcement agency from the obligations set under the bill. Section 12 permitted the state to process the personal data of data principals without their consent.Once the primary purpose of data collection is completed, the data fiduciary must remove the personal data or erase the means through which data can be linked to specific data principals.A data fiduciary can only retain user data for business or legal reasons.Data principals should have the option to give, manage, and withdraw their consent for sharing their personal data.If an employer requires their employees’ biometric information for attendance, they will need explicit consent. An employee will have full authority over their biometric information.Banks shall mandatorily maintain KYC data for at least six months after the closure of an account.The bill also contains guidelines for collecting and managing the personal data of minors. Data fiduciaries shall take parental consent into consideration. Social media companies should avoid tracking, monitoring, or having child-specific targeted advertising. The bill prescribes a penalty of up to ₹200 crores in case of failure to comply with duties related to children’s personal data.On data localisation, the new bill merely says that it will be subject to later specified rules and restrictions. The Central Government may notify nations where a data fiduciary may transmit data. Data localisation was a hot topic before the old bill was withdrawn.The new bill introduces the concept of significant data fiduciaries. This is based on the volume of data processed, the risk to users, etc. These entities will have additional obligations to enable greater scrutiny of their data protection practices. This is analogous to significant social media intermediaries’ obligations under the Information Technology (Intermediary Guidelines and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.The bill also includes a section focussing on the duties of a data principal. A data principal should provide accurate information when they claim the right to correct or erase their data. They should refrain from filing an unfounded or unjustified grievance or complaint with a data fiduciary or the Data Protection Board. It is not apparent if there will be any consequences for failing to fulfil these duties.Like every bill, this bill introduces a few new concepts. For instance, it suggests a system of graded penalties for data fiduciaries. It also covers new terms and provisions, which appear to be a comprehensive approach based on a cursory reading. Will it stand firm compared to the EU’s GDPR or California’s CCPA? And did we successfully bring the Orwellian Big Brother into the purview of the law?The draft is open for public comment till December 17, 2022.Have a suggestion regarding the draft bill?

    "headline": "Why did CCI impose a fine of ₹1338 crores against Google?",
    "data": "₹1338 crores fine imposed on GoogleThree years after the first complaint in 2019, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) fined Google for using its dominant position in October 2022. I have previously written about Google’s overwhelming dominant position and attempts to gain control through self-preferencing. Earlier in November 2020, CCI, in its prima facie order, had found that Google had misused its dominance in the market. This order focused on Google’s favourable treatment of its affiliates, called self-preferencing. This was CCI’s second investigation against Google.Before that, in April 2019, CCI ordered an investigation for allegations concerning the abuse of the dominant position. This was because most manufacturers combined Android with Google’s proprietary applications and services, creating a monopoly for Google.In the October 2022 order, CCI imposed a fine of ₹1338 crores on Alphabet Inc, Google’s parent company. This fine pertains to Google’s anti-competitive practices related to Android mobile devices for abusing its dominant market position in multiple categories. The allegations of unfair business practices concern the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) and Anti-fragmentation Agreement (AFA).The Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) of Android OS and Google had entered into these agreements. According to CCI, Google manages Android OS and other licenses, which gives it an advantage over its competitors. This advantage is in the form of pre-installing the most prominent search entry points, such as search apps, widgets, and Chrome browsers on Android devices. Furthermore, Google also secured a significant competitive edge via its revenue-earning apps like YouTube on Android devices. After this order, CCI granted Google 30 days to provide the necessary financial information and supporting documentation.Later in the month, CCI slapped another fine for compelling app developers to adopt Google’s in-app payment system. Google abused its dominant position by mandating app developers to adopt their payment system to commercialise their work. After this order, this artificial barrier should be removed by Google, allowing the developers to utilise a payment processing solution of their choice.During the proceedings, Google asserted that the said edge is essential for them to compete with the challenges from Apple. The Competition Commission noted the distinction between their business models. The core of Apple’s business is a vertically integrated smart device ecosystem that prioritises selling high-end smart devices with cutting-edge software components. In contrast, the primary motivation behind Google’s business is the desire to attract more users to its platform so that they would engage with its revenue-generating service, namely Google Search. This will directly impact the company’s ability to sell online advertising services.CCI acknowledged that there may be some rivalry between Apple and Android mobile ecosystems. However, this competition is constrained when users determine which device to purchase. OEMs utilise Android OS and Google apps in their smartphones since Google manages the Android OS and licenses its other proprietary applications. After considering it from the perspective of all demand components for Android OS and iOS, the Commission concluded that there is no substitutability between Google’s Play Store and Apple’s App Store.In August 2022, the South Korean government enacted a bill prohibiting app store operators from compelling app developers to employ their in-app payment systems. This prevents platforms like Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store from deducting commissions on in-app sales.CCI remarked that the markets should be permitted to compete on merits. The dominant player is responsible for ensuring that their behaviour does not obstruct merit-based competition. It further noted that Google had maintained its dominating position in the online search industry, denying other search apps access to the market. This violates Section 4(2)(c) of the Competition Act, 2002. Along with the fine, CCI also issued a cease-and-desist order prohibiting Google from engaging in anti-competitive behaviour.Google shall not restrict OEMs, app developers, or its current or potential rivals’ access to its Play Services APIs. This will guarantee compatibility between Android OS and Android forks while meeting Google’s compatibility standards. Additionally, Google will not stop customers from removing its pre-installed apps.After the decision, a Google spokesperson said that Android has provided more choices for everyone. It has supported thousands of successful businesses in India and across the globe. This decision is a setback for Indian consumers who rely on Android’s security features, and it will increase the cost of mobile devices in the Indian market. The spokesperson said they would review the decision before taking their next steps.The marching norm of the competition law is to enable substitution, opting out, and variety for customers so that the control of demand and supply by one or a few players is avoided. These two infractions against Google have created milestones for the Indian anti-trust regime. However, this is not the end of the road for CCI against tech giants and their unfair trade practices. Billing system allegations have already been levelled against Apple in India. Together We Fight Society, a Rajasthan-based NGO, has argued that Apple’s fee of up to 30% hurts competition by raising costs for app developers and customers. It also acts as a barrier to market entry for small developers.Looking at the proceedings in this case, it is reasonable to expect that Apple might face the same blow soon. Moreover, CCI has already acknowledged Apple’s more significant revenue base than that of Google Play. We may see a number higher than ₹1338 crores when the Commission passes its order against Apple."

    "headline": "A Beginner’s Guide to Cyber Terrorism in India",
    "data": "According to the Global Risks Report 2021, the failure of cyber security will be one of humanity’s most significant concerns in the coming decade. With a sizeable internet population, India has confronted significant cyber terrorism challenges in the last few decades. Cyber terrorism commonly includes coordinated and politically motivated attacks on information systems, programmes, or data. Cyber incidents that are menacing or frightening can be included in the definition of cyber terrorism. Attackers primarily aim to destroy or disrupt a country’s critical infrastructure.Explanation to Section 70(1) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 defines critical information infrastructure as“computer resource, the incapacitation or destruction of which, shall have debilitating impact on national security, economy, public health or safety.”Section 70A of the same act recognises National Critical Information Infrastructure Protection Centre (NCIIPC) as the national nodal agency. NCIIPC considers the following sectors as critical infrastructure: power, energy, banking, financial services, insurance, telecom, transport, government, strategic and public enterprises.Investigation of the 26/11 terrorist attack in Mumbai revealed evidence of terrorists using telecommunication technologies to learn about the map, human infrastructure, and location. They actively used Google Earth, a mobile network, and a social media platform to track the activities of Indian forces. Furthermore, they employed technology for converting auditory signals into data, making it impossible for Indian agencies to track down information sources.In another instance, in June 2011, a security incident led to flight delays at Delhi’s IGI Airport Terminal 3. This incident led to the failure of the Common Use Passengers Processing System (CUPPS). CUPPS handles boarding gates, check-in counters, and information about arrival and departure times for the terminal. The system was down for more than 12 hours, and the airport management termed this a back-end server glitch in their press release. However, CBI registered a case for a virus attack wherein the perpetrator had executed malicious code from a remote location. The 2001 attack on the Indian Parliament also deserves mention. We have discussed this incident in detail here. Other examples of cyber terrorism include a cyber attack on the Kudankulam Nuclear Power Plant and small drones that dropped explosives at the Jammu Air Base.In 2020, there was a tense stand-off at the India-China border along the Line of Control (LOC). A New York Times report claimed China was targeting India’s critical infrastructure to coerce India on the border issue. Red Echo, a state-sponsored attacking group backed by China, was considered responsible for this attack, resulting in Mumbai facing an electricity blackout.The 2008 amendment to the Information Technology Act, 2000 added Section 66F, which deals with cyber terrorism. This provision provides life imprisonment for acts that threaten India’s integrity, unity, security, and sovereignty or to strike terror in the general public. The “acts” here include denying access to computer resources, attempting to penetrate a computer resource without authorisation, and introducing any computer contaminant. These acts are likely to cause death or injuries, destroy property, prevent supplies of services essential to the community, or adversely affect the country’s critical information infrastructure.In the case of Mehid Masroor Biswas v. State of Karnataka, the accused-petitioner from Bangalore was operating a Twitter account to support the claims of ISIS. The accused successfully masked his identity using VPN and ghost IP addresses. He sent thousands of messages and posted content glorifying the Islamic Caliphate through his Twitter account. He was in regular contact with British Jihadis and even praised them as martyrs if they did. Channel 4 exposed him in December 2014, and the police charged him under various provisions of the Unlawful Action (Prevention) Act, 1967, the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Information Technology Act, 2000. While rejecting the accused’s bail petition, the Karnataka High Court opined that the allegations are prima facie true.There are also examples of cases where Section 66F has been misapplied. For example, the Tamil Nadu Police filed an FIR against a social activist for creating a documentary about manual scavenging. In Amish Devgan v. Union of India & Ors, the police charged Amish Devgan, a news anchor, under Section 66F for allegations of hurting religious sentiments.As our dependency on the internet increases, the potential damage of cyber terrorism will follow the trend. Attackers continuously evolve their tactics and look for the next target; we cannot sit back and relax. If malicious actors successfully infiltrate critical infrastructure, the impact is likely to be adverse and affect public life at large. In such a situation, the role of agencies like NCIIPC and CERT-in becomes more crucial than ever.Featured Image Credits: Cyber background vector created by freepik – www.freepik.com"

    "data": "इंटरनेट पर खतरे तो बहुत सारी जगह पर हैं, लेकिन सबसे ज्यादा खतरनाक है आपकी ऑनलाइन लेनदेन की असुरक्षा। साइबर दुनिया में अपराधी लगातार कोशिश करते रहते है की वो आपके एटीएम कार्ड या इंटरनेट बैंकिंग से जुडी हुई गोपनीय जानकारी तक पहुँच जाए। साइबर अपराध से बचने के लिए जरुरी है कि ऑनलाइन लेनदेन करते हुए आप सतर्क रहें। ऑनलाइन लेनदेन करते हुए आपको निम्नलिखित पाँच बातों का ध्यान रखना चाहिए –आपके एड्रेस बार में एक पैडलॉक (ताला) दिखाता है कि साइट पर होने वाला डाटा का आदान-प्रदान एन्क्रिप्टेड है, और इसलिए, हमलें होने की संभावना कम है। इसलिए जब भी आपको ऐसा कोई ताला दिखाई दे, निश्चिंत रहें कि आप एक सुरक्षित जगह पर हैं। लेकिन केवल यही संकेत ऐसा नहीं है जिस पर आपको भरोसा करना चाहिए।HTTP2 के आने से, HTTPS पुराना हो गया है, लेकिन अभी भी बहुत सारी साइटें हैं जो HTTPS पर निर्भर हैं। HTTPS में “s” का अर्थ है “secure”, इसलिए जब भी आप किसी पेमेंट पोर्टल पर जाएं तो एड्रेस बार में HTTPS देखें। ऐसी किसी भी वेबसाइट पर जहाँ सिर्फ HTTP है, वहां पर पेमेंट ना करें।बैक और रिफ्रेश बटन दबाना आपको भारी पड़ सकता है। ऐसा कभी-कभी होता है कि पेमेंट पूरा नहीं होता है और हम back बटन दबा देते हैं। ऐसी स्थिति में बहुत बार हमारे अकाउंट से पैसे कट जाते है। ऐसी कई वेबसाइट है जो आपको back बटन नहीं दबाने की चेतावनी देती है लेकिन कुछ वेबसाइट है जो ऐसा नहीं करती। भले ही अगर वह वेबसाइट कुछ समय ले रही है लेकिन आपको बैक और रिफ्रेश बटन दबाने की जल्दी नहीं करना चाहिए।बिना कुकीज़ के आप लेनदेन पूरा नहीं कर सकते। लेकिन जब आप का लेनदेन पूरा हो जाए और खासकर किसी पब्लिक नेटवर्क पर, ऐसी स्थिति में कुकीज़ को डिलीट करना बेहतर है। इस तरह से आप बिना अपनी सुरक्षा से समझौता करें ऑनलाइन शोपिंग कर सकते है।आपके कार्ड या नेट बैंकिंग की जानकारी दर्ज करते वक्त हमेशा वर्चुअल कीबोर्ड का इस्तेमाल करें। कई वेबसाइट टेक्स्ट बॉक्स के साथ-साथ वर्चुअल कीबोर्ड भी प्रदान करती है। हमेशा ऐसी संवेदनशील जानकारी को ऑनस्क्रीन कीबोर्ड से दर्ज करें क्योंकि स्पाइवेयर के द्वारा आपके कार्ड का सीवीवी नंबर/पासवर्ड को रिकॉर्ड कर हैकर को भेजा जा सकता है। अगर वेबसाइट पर वर्चुअल कीबोर्ड नहीं है तो आप अपने लैपटॉप/कंप्यूटर पर उपलब्ध वर्चुअल कीबोर्ड भी इस्तेमाल कर सकते है।इस लेख को अंग्रेज़ी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। | To read this article in English, click here.Featured Image Credits: Electronic payment photo created by katemangostar – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "आपके ईमेल अकाउंट को हैक करके कोई व्यक्ति क्या कर सकता है?",
    "data": "आप कितने हैक होने योग्य हो? वैसे सवाल यह है कि आपको कब हैक किया जाएगा? आधी रात में ही आप किस डेटा ब्रीच के शिकार हो जाएं, आप भी नहीं जानते। हालांकि आप की ओर से यह महत्वपूर्ण है कि आप टू-फैक्टर ऑथेंटिकेशन (2FA) और अन्य नई-नई सुरक्षा सेटिंग्स इस्तेमाल करें। ईमेल सर्विस प्रोवाइडर जैसे की जीमेल (Gmail) आपको बहुत सारी क्लाउड स्टोरेज प्रदान करते है और कभी-कभी यह स्टोरेज 20 जीबी से भी अधिक होती है और वह भी मुफ्त। इसीलिए आप ईमेल को डिलीट करने के बारे में नहीं सोचते है। कई लोग टू फैक्टर ऑथेंटिकेशन का इस्तेमाल नहीं करते हैं, फिर उनके साथ होता क्या है ? हैकर्स की बदौलत, उन्हें अपने पासवर्ड एवं कई महत्वपूर्ण और मूल्यवान डेटा से हाथ धोना पड़ता है।इस आर्टिकल में हम जानेंगे की आपके ईमेल अकाउंट तक पहुंचने वाला व्यक्ति उसके साथ क्या-क्या कर सकता है ?भारतीय दंड संहिता, 1860 की धारा 420 के कारण भारत में यह शब्द प्रचलित है। आपके सिर्फ ईमेल को पढ़कर ही कोई व्यक्ति आपके बारे में बहुत कुछ जान सकता है। जैसे वर्तमान में आपका खाता कौन सी बैंक में है, आपने नेटफ़्लिक्स या हॉटस्टार का सब्सक्रिप्शन ले रखा है या नहीं, आपके घर इंटरनेट कनेक्शन किसका है, आदि। साथ ही आपकी पहचान की चोरी और आपके निजी डेटा का दुरूपयोग भी हो सकता है।ऐसे कई मामले देखने में आये है जहाँ हैकर्स निर्यातकों का अकाउंट हैक करके उनके खरीदारों को फ़र्ज़ी इनवॉइस भेज देते है। इस इनवॉइस पर सारी जानकारी तो एक निर्यातक की होती है, पर बैंक अकाउंट डिटेल्स हैकर्स की होती है। ऐसी घटनाओं को अंजाम देने के लिए हैकर्स को सिर्फ एक बार आपके अकाउंट में फ़िल्टर और फ़ॉरवर्डर सेट करना होता है। इससे आपके सारे ईमेल हैकर के फ़र्ज़ी ईमेल पर फॉरवर्ड होते रहते है। आपको पता भी नहीं चलेगा और आपकी गोपनीय जानकारी जैसे की ओटीपी भी हैकर को फॉरवर्ड हो जायेंगे।एक केस में यह हुआ कि एक महिला को उसके विश्वसनीय दोस्त से एक ईमेल प्राप्त हुआ। ईमेल की बातचीत के संदर्भ के आधार पर उसने एक खाते में कुछ पैसे ट्रांसफर कर दिए। उसने ईमेल को अच्छी तरह से परखा, पर क्योंकि यह ईमेल उसके दोस्त के वास्तविक ईमेल एड्रेस से आया था, वह धोखा खा गई।आपकी बैंक आपके रजिस्टर्ड ईमेल एड्रेस पर आपके अकाउंट से सम्बंधित जरुरी जानकारी भेजती है। अक्सर आपके ईमेल आईडी से आपके बैंक अकाउंट तक पहुँचना आसान हो जाता है – बाकी तो आप समझ ही गए होंगे की आगे क्या हो सकता है।अगर आपका यूज़रनेम बहुत ही अच्छा या यूनिक है, तो समझ जाइये कि डार्क वेब (इंटरनेट का काला बाज़ार) पर अच्छी खासी कीमत मिल सकती है। अगर सामान्य यूज़रनेम और पासवर्ड भी है तब भी कुछ न कुछ कीमत तो होगी है। उदारहण के तौर पर एप्पल आईट्यून्स के यूज़रनेम पासवर्ड की कीमत लगभग ₹500 होती है।टू-फैक्टर ऑथेंटिकेशन (2FA) का उपयोग करें ।ऐसे पासवर्ड बनाये जिसका कोई मतलब नहीं हो।आपके सभी खातों के लिए अलग-अलग पासवर्ड रखें।एक से ज़्यादा ईमेल का उपयोग करके आप रिस्क को कम कर सकते है। ज़रूरी काम जैसे बैंकिंग, बीमा, आदि के लिए अलग ईमेल एड्रेस बनाये।इस लेख को अंग्रेज़ी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। | To read this article in English, click here.Featured Image Credits: Email vector created by storyset – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "How to secure your LinkedIn account?",
    "data": "In my previous articles, I have discussed security settings on Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Snapchat. For this article, the focus now shifts to LinkedIn. You would usually find that your friends have locked their Facebook profiles and set their Instagram accounts to private if you look around. However, they rarely check the security settings available on LinkedIn. We must understand that our professional updates are equally at risk from cyber criminals. Always remember that your safety is in your hands. Here are a few security settings that you must enable.Let’s start.Open the LinkedIn app on your mobile phone. You will see your profile picture in the top left corner. Tap on your picture.Home PageNow, the following screen will appear. Tap on the Settings option.Navigating to SettingsThis should lead you to the Settings page. We will first start with the Sign in & security section.Sign in & securityYou should see the following options on this page. We will address them one by one.Sign in & securityThe first step will always be the same for every platform: password. Most of us have our partner’s name, pet’s name, date of birth, or even 123456 as our passwords. These are passwords that anybody can guess and get access to our accounts. Put plainly, avoid using such passwords. If you really want to use your pet’s name as your password, make it strong. For example, if your pet’s name is Simba, you can set your password as $imba@6842.What I did here is that I replaced S with $, i with !, the letter m is the same, replaced b with the number 2 as b is the second letter, replaced a with @ and then added a random number at the end. You should consider changing your passwords once every quarter. When you change your password, you must enable the option for “Require all devices to sign in with new password“.Password SettingsFor more information on how you should create strong passwords, you can check this article.The next step is to check the devices where you are signed in. When you tap on this option, you will see active sessions for your LinkedIn account. Using this feature, you can check if there are any suspicious active sessions and log out from them immediately. You will see information like approximate location, IP address, and IP address owner.Where you are logged inThis option will help you check if any previously used device still remembers your password.Devices that remember your passwordTwo-factor authentication (2FA) prevents others from logging into your account even if they know your password. You can either set it up through your mobile number or apps like Google Authenticator and Microsoft Authenticator. To use Google Authenticator on your mobile, check the guide available here.2FAThis is the second segment of security settings available on LinkedIn. From here, you can control the visibility of your profile and contact information. Tap on the Visibility option.VisibilityYou can decide what others see when you view your profile. You can choose to show your name and headline or stay completely anonymous. If you choose to remain anonymous, you will not be able to see who viewed your profile.Profile viewing optionsLike profile viewing options, you can decide what others see when you view their story.Story viewing optionsYou can customise your profile for non-logged in internet users. You can limit what is shown on search engines and other off-LinkedIn services. Moreover, you can make your profile picture visible only to your first-degree connections or make it public. The same is true with the headline, articles, activity, current experience, etc. This feature also allows you to preview your public profile.Edit your public profileYou can select who can see your email address on your profile or download it in their data exports.

    "headline": "Decoding DeFi",
    "data": "Can you imagine a world where loans, insurance, and every other financial service exist in a blockchain, just like cryptocurrencies? It sounds exciting and, at the same time, complicated. This is what decentralised finance (DeFi) is all about. DeFi is a borderless global system where customers can directly avail themselves of financial services on a decentralised blockchain. This means that middlemen like brokers will not have any control over the system. As a result, a customer can avoid paying for what those middlemen charge.If you would like to read more on how the underlying blockchain technology works, you should read this article. A DeFi system uses smart contracts and cryptocurrencies to provide financial services without the bank’s involvement in the transaction. Smart contracts in a blockchain system get triggered automatically when parties meet the contractual conditions. Alongside smart contracts, DeFi systems rely on decentralised apps (DApps). DApps are similar to traditional apps; however, they operate autonomously and run on a blockchain or peer-to-peer (P2P) network.After the introduction of Bitcoins in 2008, blockchain technology has slowly gained popularity over the years. Moreover, it has been adopted for various applications, as I discussed here. DeFi did not have a definite name and recognition as today until 2018. A group consisting of entrepreneurs and software developers coined “DeFi”. It is an umbrella term for all open-source financial applications built by that time. Key features of a DeFi system are:It removes the service fees charged by brokers, banks, and other middlemen.No entity controls the system, and users do not require permission to avail services.Specific applications like synthetic assets and flash loans only exist on blockchains.Users can swiftly make payments.Transparency: Users can verify every aspect of the system due to its inherent transparency.Financial security: A DeFi system is considered secure due to the tamper-proof nature of the underlying blockchain technology.Absence of financial institutions: DeFi systems do not have a centralised structure where a regulatory authority controls everything, including relationships between financial institutions and end-users.Avoid charges: DeFi systems do not have middlemen, and hence, users do not need to pay service charges to financial institutions involved in the transaction.Risks involved: DeFi systems can have technological, asset, and product risks. For example, vulnerabilities in code can result in the overall system’s weakness.Volatility: Cryptocurrencies are highly volatile as their values fluctuate constantly. However, system developers can rely on cryptocurrencies that are extremely stable and are known as stablecoins. Stablecoins are quite useful for cross-border transfers without worrying about the volatility factor.Proper regulation: With no regulatory mechanism in place, the lender may not hold the borrower accountable under any existing law to recover dues.Heavy-duty computing: Managing a DeFi system is a computationally expensive process. Before deciding whether you wish to use a DeFi system, as Mark Cuban says, “do your research”.One can understand DeFi better by differentiating traditional financial systems from decentralised systems. Here are three significant differences to keep in mind:Banks and other financial institutions control the transactions in a centralised system. On the other hand, no single entity controls your transactions in DeFi.Centralised systems involve intermediaries like banks and brokers. In DeFi systems, smart contracts replace intermediaries to ensure that parties fulfil their obligations.To borrow from a bank, you will need to verify your identity and possess a good credit score. In certain cases, banks can also ask for collateral. In a decentralised system, customers can remain anonymous and keep their identities secret.In October 2021, an Economic Times report noted that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) plans to red-flag DeFi platforms. The reason is that India does not have any statute or regulation to deal with either blockchain or cryptocurrency. Further, the cryptocurrency heist at Poly Network, a DeFi platform, has highlighted many unanswered questions and ambiguities in the system. From January to July 2021, the hackers stole $613 million worth of digital currency from the platform. Therefore, DeFi is still a work in progress, and it can take a while before such systems see massive adoption.Featured Image Credits: Digital assets photo created by rawpixel.com – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "E-Waste Regulation in India",
    "data": "We cannot imagine a world without electrical and electronic equipment around us. These types of equipment include your refrigerator, mobile phone, laptop, microwave oven, etc. But do you know what happens after your devices are no longer usable? They become electronic waste (or e-waste). Since we have no intentions to reuse it, we are most likely to discard it. While some of us may not dispose of them with our household waste, we sell them to our community kabariwalas, don’t we? The kabariwalas keep the valuable items and throw the rest in landfills. This extraction of metals from e-waste can result in hazardous and severe threats to humans and other living beings.Materials like arsenic, nickel, zinc, and lead can cause damage to various organs of our body. This manner of disposal is not the proper way. Moreover, e-waste regulations in India specify that only authorised dismantlers and recyclers can collect e-waste from the public. According to ASSOCHAM, India is one of the top five countries when it comes to e-waste generation. We generate 20 lakh tonnes of electronic waste per year. When it comes to recycling, we only recycle 4.3 lakh tonnes in a year. If we continue to generate waste at this pace, we will hit the 100 million tonnes mark by 2050. It is about time that we adopt sustainable methods for e-waste management. In this article, we take a closer look at e-waste regulations in India.Yes. India is the only country in Southern Asia with e-waste regulations. Over the last couple of decades, India has made significant progress in handling e-waste. In 2005, Mr V.J. Darda, then Rajya Sabha MP from Maharashtra, presented a private member’s bill called “The Electronic Waste (Handling and Disposal) Bill, 2005.” The bill sought to regulate improper ways of e-waste disposal. It also talked about the responsibilities of manufacturers, recyclers, and consumers. However, the bill lapsed when his tenure was completed in 2010.At present, the e-waste regulation framework in India includes the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008 and the E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016.Before this set of rules, the Hazardous Waste (Management and Handling) Rules, 1989 considered electronic waste under the category of hazardous waste. According to the amended 1989 Rules, hazardous waste is any waste that is dangerous due to its chemical, reactive, toxic, and corrosive nature.  To supersede the 1989 Rules, the Government introduced the Hazardous Wastes (Management, Handling and Transboundary Movement) Rules, 2008. The objective was to frame an appropriate regulation for e-waste and comply with the requirements of the Basel Convention.The 2008 Rules made it mandatory for anyone who seeks to recycle or reprocess hazardous waste to register with the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB). Such a person must satisfy the requirements laid down by CPCB to utilise environmentally sound technologies and requisite facilities for managing electronic waste. A consumer must only send or sell their unusable equipment or devices to a registered recycler or re-processor.The E-Waste (Management) Rules, 2016 superseded the 2012 Rules of the same name. The introduction of the 2012 Rules was the first full-fledged regulation on e-waste. It applies to every producer, recycler, and consumer involved in selling, purchasing, manufacturing, or processing electronic or electrical components. The 2012 Rules required the products to provide contact details of authorised e-waste collectors to their consumers. The 2016 Rules came into effect on October 01, 2017.Reverse chain: The 2016 Rules strengthened the Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR). A producer’s responsibility now includes returning the damaged equipment and safely recycling the e-waste.Scheme of deposit: The rules recommend providing a scheme of deposit as a part of EPR. The scheme should specify the amount consumers have to deposit while purchasing a product. When consumers return with the damaged product, they can reclaim the deposit with interest. A company can consider setting up a dedicated department called E-Waste Collection, Handling, and Disposal.No pollutants: Every producer must ensure that their equipment or devices are free from contaminants like mercury, lead, and cadmium.Inclusion of informal sector: The new rules recommend including the informal sector. The local e-waste collectors handle around 90% of the waste generated in the country. The authorities can conduct training programmes for the proper management of electronic waste at grassroots.Extended responsibility of bulk consumers: Bulk consumers must hand over their e-waste to authorised recyclers only.E-waste from imported goods: The obligation to dispose of e-waste generated from imported goods is on the importers. An importer must file an application to CPCB along with documents like budgetary allocation, awareness plan, and EPR plan.The Ministry of Environment and Forest amended the 2016 Rules through the E-Waste (Management) Amendment Rules, 2018. The amended rules reduced waste collection targets for industries. Further, they introduced the registration of Producer Responsibility Organisation (PRO). The government will cover the costs for sampling and testing equipment instead of the producer.If it goes unregulated, e-waste is another waste management crisis. With time, diligent e-waste disposal and management will have crucial roles. Poor waste management in the country is due to a lack of infrastructure and improper implementation of existing regulations. While there are several recycling units for electronic waste, they are not enough, considering the amount of waste we generate. With that said, MEITY has developed cost-effective and appropriate technologies to recycle and reuse materials in an environmentally sound manner. The government encourages the general public to participate in Swachh Digital Bharat by giving e-waste to authorised recyclers.While the government can introduce regulations and launch initiatives, the onus equally lies on individuals. Therefore, every consumer must discard electronic waste by giving it only to authorised collectors. This is the least we can do to keep the environment safe as a consumer.Featured Image Credits: Isometric vector created by macrovector – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "How does DMCA takedown work?",
    "data": "If you are a website owner, one of your worst nightmares will be another website copying your content. Content replication can result in copyright violation due to copyright protection available to rightful copyright owners. One such law is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the United States. I recommend you to read the article we have written on DMCA before proceeding further.I am sure you have come across websites with plagiarised content. What will you do when someone copies your article and publishes it on their website? Takedown is one of the remedies available with a copyright owner. As per Google’s transparency report, they have received more than 5.6 billion requests for URLs infringing copyright.First things first, every copyright owner has the right to process a takedown notice against a website owner for copyright violation if their content is used without permission. The DMCA takedown procedure involves sending a takedown notice to the service provider requesting them to take down the infringing content. The service providers can be a search engine like Google or a hosting service provider like GoDaddy.However, one must understand that there are possible uses without authorisation that are not considered infringement. This is called the Fair Use Doctrine. It is an exception doctrine extending to limited purposes such as news reporting, teaching, criticism, and research.Before starting the DMCA takedown procedure, you can contact the website owner and request them to take the copied content down. There are good chances that the website owner will remove the content. If the website owner does not respond to you despite your efforts to contact them, you can proceed with filing a DMCA complaint.1. Understand where to file a complaint: You will need to find where the website has hosted the content. Tools like WhoIs can help you identify the domain registrar and hosting provider for the website in question. Most service providers have a dedicated page (or form) for reporting DMCA violations.2. Contents of a DMCA takedown complaint: You will require the following information to file a DMCA complaint:Location of infringing material (URLs)Your contact information (Phone number, email, address)A statement saying that the website in question has used your content without your authorisation.A declaration specifying that the information you have given is correct.Electronic/physical signature3. Time taken in responding to a DMCA complaint: This largely depends on the location of the copied content and the service provider’s speed in processing the incoming DMCA requests. Since DMCA is a US law, service providers outside the US may not accept a DMCA takedown complaint.You will receive notifications regarding any DMCA complaints filed against you. Do not ignore such emails regarding DMCA takedown notices. If you believe that this complaint is a mistake, you can subsequently file a DMCA counter-notice. Section 512(f) of the DMCA Act aims to deter false infringement claims by imposing liability on parties making a false claim. For a counter-notice, your response should include information such as:Location of URLsYour contact information (phone number, email, address)A statement clarifying that the service provider has taken down the content due to misidentificationYou may need to give your consent to the jurisdiction of a federal courtAcceptance of service of process from the party who submitted the takedown noticeElectronic/physical signatureSo far, we have discussed copyright violations and the takedown procedure that the service providers are bound by. Can there be instances where a service provider denies accepting a takedown request? Google elaborates on a case where they rejected the request filed by a Ukrainian politician. The politician had complained about his images being used in several articles criticising his performance in the office. Google rejected this complaint as this use did not amount to copyright infringement. So, delisting or taking down is not always the case as service providers may not entertain frivolous complaints and requests. Therefore, one must ensure that they file DMCA complaints only for genuine reasons.Featured Image Credits: People vector created by storyset – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Virtual Private Network (VPN): Legal or Illegal?",
    "data": "Myanmar’s military junta has sought to introduce a law prohibiting the use of VPNs in a move to widen its internet censorship. The proposed law stipulates imprisonment of one to three years and fines of up to 5 million Myanmar Kyats (~$2,800). Moreover, the law places an obligation on service providers to provide personal information to authorities when requested.Have you ever connected to a random Wi-Fi hotspot with a name like Boston-MA-St80? It may seem like a legit Wi-Fi network, but there is a good chance that criminals have set it up to gain access to your personal information. In such situations, a VPN can help you have a secure connection. The role of VPN becomes really crucial when you are connecting to a fake Wi-Fi access point or an unsecured public network. A Virtual Private Network (VPN) helps users securely browse the internet. It creates an encrypted tunnel for our data to flow securely. It also hides your original IP address and hides your identity and location. To read more on VPN, click here.Using VPN is legal in most countries. However, some countries have restricted or criminalised the use of VPNs. As for India, using VPN should not land you in any legal trouble. Let’s look at countries that have either restricted or criminalised the use of VPNs.China heavily regulates the use of VPNs to prevent its citizens from bypassing the online censorship system, also known as the Great Firewall of China. The Chinese government has not criminalised using VPNs due to their use in international businesses. However, the existing laws require VPN providers to obtain a license from the government to operate in the country. As a result, only authorised VPN service providers can provide their services.In November 2021, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) released the draft Network Data Security Management Regulations. The Draft Regulations cover various topics, including restrictions on VPNs. CAC seeks to impose strict penalties on individuals and organisations that circumvent the Great Firewall. The offender would be subject to fines up to 10 times the illegal profits of a company or up to RMB 500,000 ($78,300). In serious cases, the Draft Regulations also provide for suspension or termination of business operations or licenses.Most North Korean citizens do not have access to the internet. Instead, they connect to North Korea’s intranet – Kwangmyong, a Korean word for a bright star. The country has illegalised the use of VPNs or any other tool that helps in circumventing internet censorship. Such use is outlawed to prevent the citizens from accessing the censored content.Oman has illegalised the use of VPNs since 2010. For public and private institutions to use VPNs, they must gain prior approval from Oman’s Telecom Regulatory Authority. A fine of 500 Omani Rial ($1,300) on individuals or 1,000 Omani Rial ($2,600) on companies is imposed if they are found in breach of the law. Amid the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak, Oman decided to uplift restrictions on tools such as Skype for Business, Google Meet, and Zoom.It is legal to use VPNs in Turkey as no statute prohibits the same. However, the Turkish government has restricted VPNs through Law No. 5651. Through a new paragraph added to Article 6, the law requires access providers to “take measures to prevent alternative access route in relation to the publications that were decided to block access.” The legislation imposes an administration fine from 10,000 ($734) to 50,000 ($3,670) Turkish Liras on the access providers who fail to comply with this obligation. Previously in 2016, the Information Technologies and Communications Authority had sent a notice to access providers to restrict various VPN services.UAE has not explicitly banned using VPNs unless used to commit crimes. The Federal Law No. 5 of 2012 provides punishment for temporary imprisonment and a fine of not less than AED 500,000 ($136,128) with a maximum of AED 2,000,000 ($544,512). However, it is difficult for individuals to prove that they used VPN for the right reasons.In 2014, Iraq widened its internet censorship to include a ban on VPNs due to then-ongoing national security concerns.Russia has restricted the use of proxy avoidance tools like VPNs and anonymisers since 2017. The country has a federal law prohibiting web tools that allow Russians to access outlawed websites. In 2021, the Russian internet watchdog, Roskomnadzor banned six more VPN service providers, bringing the total to over a dozen. The reasons cited include illegal activities, distribution of drugs, child pornography, extremism, and suicide.Over time, VPNs have evolved to become an essential tool to stay private and safe online. Governments and businesses are increasingly adopting VPN services for the secure transmission of sensitive information. It is legal to use VPNs in most countries. However, if you reside in a country with restrictions or a blanket ban, you may find it difficult to access censored content. Such restrictions prevent individuals from exercising their freedom to access the internet. The degree of restrictions increases with the nature of a country’s regime. Countries impose a high level of censorship to control the narrative and hinder access to the rest of the world, thereby completely regulating the internet for their citizens.Featured Image Credits: Hand drawn vector created by freepik – www.freepik.com"

With active participation on social media and fascination for the capital market, investors rely on stock market tips available on the internet. In so many instances, the finance influencers (“influencers”) advertise earning exponential profit in a short duration of time by following their tips and techniques.Understanding the technicalities and complex procedures of the market is not everyone’s cup of tea. A person interested in the subject or future profits can only learn through experience and practice. In such a situation, investors look for easier alternatives. There can be no better alternative when something is as accessible as social media tips.Advice available on a random social media account may lack the backing of experts’ knowledge. Further, it is also possible that the individuals providing stock market tips have not registered with SEBI. Irrespective of the platform, advice on any platform is merely an opinion. If you act on such advice, you cannot recover the losses incurred. In the stock market, one’s loss is another’s profit. Even if you act on advice provided by authorised advisers, you cannot claim your losses. When you act on the advice, you impliedly accept that you are accepting the risk.The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has recently raided two companies in Gujarat. These companies were providing financial advice on Telegram without any authorisation or registration. These companies were earning huge profits by squaring off their position after the users had acted on their advice and the price of shares increased. When these companies provided stock market tips, their followers acted on the advice. As a result, the demand for the shares of a particular company will increase, and so will the price per share. Once the price increased, these companies closed their positions and made profits.In another instance, SEBI imposed a penalty of ₹15 lakhs on two senior employees of Antique Broking for sharing unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI). These executives were a part of WhatsApp groups that exchanged insider tips of several blue-chip companies. They subsequently forwarded these tips to their clients, who were institutional investors.SEBI plays a significant role in controlling, protecting, and managing the stockholders in the capital market. The law does not allow manipulation or control of the capital market through social media platforms. As per SEBI rules and regulations, only authorised research analysts and investment advisers can provide financial advice. However, there is a difference between research analysts and investment advisers. Research analysts can receive authorisation for giving recommendations and tips for stocks and securities.On the other hand, investment advisers provide the same function but with personalised services. The SEBI (Intermediaries) Regulations, 2008, the SEBI (Investment Advisers) Regulations, 2013, and the SEBI (Research Analysts) Regulations, 2014, govern the process for registration of analysts and advisers. The eligibility criteria for a research analyst requires passing the National Institute of Securities Market Research Examination (NISM Series 15). For an investment advisor, the requirement is to receive certification after passing the NISM Series 10A and 10B papers. After an individual passes these tests, they have to procure an appropriate license for either research analyst or investment adviser from SEBI.The practical problem that an investor may face is filtering information available on social media. SEBI does not prohibit any authorised research analyst and investment adviser from increasing social media reach and customer base. Therefore, social media has both sets of advice, authorised and unauthorised. For the benefit of investors, SEBI provides a list of authorised research analysts and investment advisers on its website.Featured Image Credits: Background vector created by freepik – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Blockchain beyond Bitcoin",
    "data": "Blockchain beyond BitcoinBitcoin became popular way before its underlying technology. Satoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin through a white paper in 2009. Even in 2022, most people associate blockchain technology with cryptocurrency only. However, with a decentralised structure at the core, it can transform and revolutionise traditional industries. This article looks at various applications of blockchain, other than cryptocurrency.Using blockchain technology as an intermediary for transferring money can be quick and cost-effective. This application can replace slow and costly cross-border transactions. The technology can provide a secure way for international payments. Banco Santander launched the world’s first blockchain-based money transfer service in 2018. This service enables customers to make same-day or next-day international money transfers.Moreover, lenders can provide collateralised loans using this technology through smart contracts. Smart contracts allow activating the loan repayment and releasing the collateral automatically upon specific actions. This can allow faster processing of loans, with lenders providing attractive rates. Blockchain can further aid in combating money laundering as encryption is a critical feature of any system. Additionally, it can work wonders for banks when it comes to record management and identification.Similar to loans, insurance companies can use smart contracts to provide insurance services for their customers. With safe management of claims, this technology also brings in transparency. The underlying technology can also help eliminate the possibility of invalid claims, such as multiple claims on the same accident. The American Association of Insurance Services (AAIS) recently launched an openIDL (Open Insurance Data Link). The openIDL is a network built on the IBM Blockchain Platform, and it automates regulatory reporting and insights for insurers.Due to the tamper-free nature of blockchain, securing personally identifiable information seems like the perfect job. The technology stores information in a decentralised manner. At present, it appears to be suitable for storing health-related data such as gender, age, medical history, etc. Having medical records accessible on a blockchain can help doctors obtain accurate details of their patients. A patient may have multiple health records with several doctors they consult. By having their complete medical data history, doctors can provide them with the best possible care.Real estate transactions involve procedures and paperwork, such as transfer deeds, verification of financial information, and ownership. Applying blockchain technology in real estate is comparatively safer for transparent authentication and transfer of ownership. Adopting blockchain technology for real estate can result in quicker transactions, reduced fraudulent activities, cost-effective procedures, and decreased paperwork throughout a transaction.Governments at multiple levels hold information such as marital status, birth and death dates, and other personal information of every citizen. Managing data for billions of citizens is not an easy task. Blockchain can help in simplifying the process of recording data. Another interesting use case is the voting system. Tallying votes can be more accessible and efficient, and creating fake IDs will become impossible. In a blockchain, each block is different from the other one, making it difficult to change or tamper with the recorded data.Blockchain can help content creators get remuneration and recognition for their work. A major benefit can be reduced piracy. Several media companies have started incorporating blockchain technology to protect their intellectual property rights and eliminate fraud. MarketWatch has predicted that the global market for blockchain in media and entertainment will reach $1.54 billion by 2024. Eluvio’s Content Fabric has started using blockchain for distributing premium content to consumers without relying on content delivery networks.The COVID-19 pandemic has brought a drastic transformation in the education industry. Educational institutions across the globe adopted innovative ways to teach and evaluate their students. Institutions can adopt blockchain technology for tracking day-to-day information like homework, attendance, and extra-curricular activities. Moreover, organisations can use this technology to store long-term information like degrees and colleges.Blockchain technology is slightly older than a decade. However, it is expected to grow rapidly in the next few years. As blockchain sees increased adoption, this has led to consideration of issues such as privacy concerns, high environmental cost, integration, and uncertainty in regulatory frameworks. Considering the benefits of this emerging technology, the global community can overcome these challenges and rectify them over time.Featured Image Credits: Bitcoin logo vector created by starline – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Copyright over Music in Short Videos",
    "data": "I am sure you have already seen a few Instagram reels today. With the introduction of short videos on practically every platform, people no longer associate them with just TikToks. They are getting more popular and common. These short videos are no longer limited to dance pieces or business promotions. However, what is common in most of these videos is some audio. While some of these videos might have the content creator’s original voice, users often use music from different artists. What if an Instagram user includes your song in their video without your permission?In this article, I analyse the terms and conditions of two popular platforms, Instagram and YouTube, and discuss how they deal with the issue of music copyright in short videos.Reels using the same audio/musicShort videos with a limit of up to 60 seconds are popularly known as reels. In their terms and conditions, Instagram has committed to protecting the copyrights of content owners. If I create a reel and someone else uses the audio in their reels, a viewer will see my name at the bottom of the screen. This creates a way to give due credit to the audio’s original creator. If you end up uploading someone else’s music as your own original audio, Instagram replaces the reel description and gives credit to the actual creator. Therefore, Instagram’s algorithm is capable enough of detecting licensed music and audio. Once the algorithm comes into action, it modifies the audio credits and adds the reel to the common page for this reel’s audio. All the reels using the same audio are available on this common page.There is one situation where this becomes tricky. If a user believes that Instagram has mistakenly added your reel to an audio page belonging to another artist, you can simply delete the reel from that page. As a result, you will get your credits back, and the reel will show your name as the original creator.Audio credits in duetsInstagram tries to prevent copyright violation when users remix their reels with other users’ reels. If you do a duet with your friend’s reel containing licensed music or audio, the original creator’s name appears below the reel. Further, when you download a reel, the downloaded file does not come with licensed music or audio. Another interesting situation is when your reel is a mixture of original as well as licensed audio. If you download this reel, you will only hear the part that you originally added.Instagram also has a dedicated page that explains what copyright is and what content creators should do to adhere to copyright rules. The guidance available on this page states that content creators should ensure that they give due credit to the copyright owner. The platform also recommends that creators have written permission from the copyright owner before using the same anywhere else.Music page on YouTube Shorts leading to the original music videoLike Instagram has Reels, YouTube has Shorts. Users can create short videos of duration between 15 to 60 seconds. Content creators can use songs and audio from YouTube’s music library. Not only a creator can add the audio in their Shorts video, but they can also create a shorter version of an existing Shorts video or any YouTube video. The creator’s video will show credits to the original source in all these cases. For example, if I take an audio clip from a music video titled tech brief by techgod, YouTube will show credits to techgod in my video. Content creators on YouTube have the power to limit the audio use from their videos by third parties. Similar to Instagram, the downloaded video does not come with copyrighted audio. Like any major platform, YouTube has published copyright guidelines for the platform users at its Copyright Centre.Available information shows that platforms are concerned about the rights of copyright owners. However, users may find a loophole to fool the algorithm and bypass the copyright restrictions. Further, original creators have no way of knowing if another creator is using their audio and earning from the content created. It will be interesting to see how platforms improvise their algorithms to detect unfair use of copyrighted content. It is also necessary that the original copyright owners benefit from the videos being created by using their content, except for credits.Featured Image Credits: Social media vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Automated Recommendation Systems and Decisional Privacy",
    "data": "Are you planning to binge-watch a newly released TV series or rewatch K3G for the 50th time? But if you have not chosen what to watch, Netflix’s Play Something feature might come to your rescue. This newly added feature allows Netflix to play a title based on users’ interests and prior watching behaviour. Unfortunately, or fortunately, Netflix’s Play Something is not the only one that exists. Remember Spotify’s Discover Weekly? This feature provides the users with a curated playlist based on their listening of the past week. With bright graphics and a well-customised and personalised playlist, the feature delivers 30 new songs every Monday. Using algorithm recommendation systems, internet companies have found a way to answer your questions about what is trending, where to eat, and what to watch and listen to.Most internet platforms today use a recommendation system to provide their users with personalised suggestions on content, purchases, groups, and connections, amongst others. Platforms rely on algorithm-based recommendation systems to help users deal with the number of options available and engage with them. The recommendation systems require personal information from users to predict their preferences and curate a personalised feed for each user. For example, Netflix’s recommendation system works on viewing, history, ratings, genres, categories, and preferences of other users with similar interests. Additionally, a recommendation system can also consider the time of the day a user watches Netflix, the device being used, and the duration of Netflix usage.As more and more platforms engage recommendation systems, there is a growing concern about the enormous power such systems assert over the other users. Karen Yeung notes that by configuring users’ informational choices through algorithm analysis, these systems nudge users in the directions preferred by the choice architect through subtle, unobtrusive, and yet extraordinarily powerful processes.On the other hand, internet platforms contend that these recommendation systems enhance user experience and provide convenience. However, there are numerous ethical and privacy risks associated with such systems. The companies collect a lot of personal information on their users, from their political leanings to the most recent purchase. They can also engage with their users using the collected personal information. Eventually, this translates into monetary benefits for the companies as they can sell the number of eyes engaged to the advertisers. In addition, the deployment of such automated recommendation systems often creates a filter bubble.Internet activist Eli Pariser coined the term filter bubble in 2011 in his book based on the same title. He defines filter buttle as an algorithm’s decision based on our past online habits. He further argues in his book that algorithms create a unique universe of information for each one of us, which fundamentally alters the way we encounter ideas and information.Creating such filter bubbles hypernudges the users in a direction that the system selects. This limits their choices and their capacity to make informed decisions. As a result, filter bubbles end up violating the users’ decisional privacy. Decisional privacy allows individuals to make free and informed choices about themselves without unwarranted interference. Such unjustifiable interference helps a platform in accessing user behaviour and actions. They have the power to influence, change, or nudge users’ decisions without their prior permission. At the same time, filter bubbles prevent individuals from accessing information that contradicts their beliefs. ARS systems serve the users with a homogenous experience, limiting their chances of accessing different viewpoints. Nonetheless, these systems end up reinforcing the already existing beliefs.In the Puttaswamy case, the Indian Supreme Court noted that the right to privacy includes decisional autonomy. The court further observed that decisional privacy allows individuals to decide about their own bodies without unjustifiable interference. As the platforms’ reliance on ARS increases, it becomes important to prevent the power to influence and shape opinions these systems assert on the users and prevent them from making informed choices. Internet platforms must offer transparency and accountability on how their recommendation systems are built, how they function and offer personalised recommendations. They should outline the situations where they use systems like ARS in a way that a layman can comprehend.As we move towards the age of Artificial Intelligence, protecting decisional privacy will be a shared responsibility of various stakeholders. If a platform offers a recommendation or suggestion to the user, it must tell the reason behind the suggestion. Most importantly, the platforms should provide users with an easy way to know how their data is collected and processed by the recommendation systems. Moreover, policymakers should incorporate necessary legal controls for ensuring transparency and fairness in automated processes."

    "headline": "What is a Decentralised Autonomous Organisation?",
    "data": "Is it possible to do business without having a physical office and a management board? Can a company function without its shareholders, employees and the memorandum of association? Can any organisation survive without having even one physical meeting? Doesn’t it seem impossible? Well, it may seem unreal, but it is not. The idea of absolutely substituting humans with machines sounds absurd until someone comes across a concept like decentralised autonomous organisation.A DAO is similar to other business organisations like Google and Microsoft except for its autonomous nature. These organisations work independently of any human intervention. Today, DAOs have a scarce presence across the globe. However, it may become a reality soon with the further developments in blockchain technology. Most likely, decentralised autonomous organisations (DAOs) are here to disrupt traditional business functions.The internet allows people across the globe to connect and form groups, forums or associations. Generally, the group consists of like-minded people. Participants of a DAO agree to a set of rules for the governance and decision making procedure. Consequently, a smart contract that incorporates the agreed rules on the supporting public blockchain comes into existence. The smart contract reduces the burden of completing small tasks like paying invoices and placing orders. Subsequently, it helps in the autonomous functioning of the DAO.DAO has three basic characteristics:Decentralised: DAO does not have a hierarchical mechanism of decision-making. Every member has an equal say in the functioning of a DAO.Autonomous: The decision-making process is autonomous. It helps in minimising the possibility of errors. A code written on the public blockchain is enforced automatically without human intervention.Organisation: It is a group of individuals that connect over the internet to achieve a common objective. Once a DAO comes into existence, it becomes a separate entity. However, individuals continue to have interests in organisational objectives.Through DAO, individuals agree to run a business or undertake an activity without meeting in person. The organisation’s formation requires a high level of trust among members. Since no one can judge the veracity of members on the internet, blockchain technology helps maintain a secure environment for the functioning of DAOs. To read more on how blockchain works, check this article.A DAO functions with the help of various interconnected autonomous smart contracts on the blockchain. Unlike traditional organisations, a DAO does not have any hierarchical management system. Technically, there is no boss to run the organisation. Regardless of the time of joining, every member of the organisation is given sufficient opportunity to contribute to the decisions through voting.There are two types of ownership in DAO, token-based and share-based.Token-based ownership: Every DAO has a treasury. Proceeds from tokens act as a funding source for a DAO. A token is a cryptocurrency linked with the organisation. Like shares and other securities, tokens are released either during the funding period (before releasing the DAO) or at regular intervals defined in the code. The value of a token is directly linked with the organisation’s performance. The token holders benefit from the rise in token price. The tokens are marketable on the decentralised exchanges. After the initial financing, a DAO is launched.Share-based ownership: On the other hand, an individual submits a proposal to a DAO for contributing towards the work or providing finance. In return, they receive voting and ownership rights.A programming code written on the smart contract governs the organisation’s functioning. Smart contracts implement the rules without any human intervention. For instance, members of a DAO can modify the code by amending the code. Amendments require the member’s votes on a proposal. While we say that DAO functions completely without human intervention, humans still intervene for giving directions and guide a DAO.The community members of a DAO prepare the source code in line with their mutual agreements. This source code remains available in the public domain. Every new member joining the organisation agrees to code and gets a fair and equal opportunity to shape the organisation. Unlike a traditional organisation, there is no board of directors and top-level management. Since all the members are on the same pedestal, each person has the liberty to express their ideas. Members collectively control and manage the organisation.DAOs in connection with cryptocurrency can be a revolutionary combination. It has so far witnessed an ascending graph with the development of decentralised finance (DeFi). The future of DAOs appears to be bright in the light of technological developments. However, there are concerns over legality, security, and governance. The probability of hacking increases if there are loopholes and vulnerabilities in the source code. Further, eliminating humans from the functioning of every business organisation may not be possible at this point. For DAOs to be successful, they require increased acceptance from the global community and availability at affordable costs.Featured Image Credits: People vector created by rawpixel.com – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Explainer – Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000",
    "data": "Porn has always been a controversial topic in India. Nobody wants to talk about it, but everybody wants to watch it. At The Cyber Blog India, we receive around 10-12 queries every day regarding the legality of watching or storing porn in India. For adult porn, our response is here in the form of this article. But, as far as child pornography is concerned, it is illegal in all ways. The Information Technology Act, 2000 and the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 are two relevant laws. Before 2008, we did not have any specific law or provision dealing with child pornography. The 2008 amendment to the Information Technology Act, 2000, introduced Section 67B. This article elaborates on important keywords and sub-sections of Section 67B.The 2019 amendment to the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 included the definition of child pornography in Section 2(1)(da). It defines child pornography as a visual depiction of a child involved in any sexual activity, which can be in the form of a picture, video, digital image, or computer-generated image. The definition also covers content in which characters appears to depict children. Further, Article 2 of the Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child (2002) provides a more inclusive definition. It says that child pornography can be any representation of a child engaged in real or simulated sexually explicit activities. The term also includes representing a child’s sexual parts for sexual purposes. Some arguments say that child sexual abuse material is a more appropriate term than child pornography, and we indeed agree.A child is anyone below the age of 18 years, irrespective of gender.Put plainly, it means any act or material that involves sexual conduct. The type of material can include pictures, videos, and other file formats.This provision makes it a criminal offence to publish or transmit any electronic material that portrays children in a sexually explicit act or conduct. The ambit of this sub-section further covers individuals who help in the actual act of publication or transmission. “Electronic form” will not only include a website or social media platforms accessible over the internet, but it will also cover sharing via Bluetooth, email, and different types of storage devices. For example, Madurai Police arrested a man for sharing child pornography videos through WhatsApp and email in August 2021.Sub-section (b) covers multiple aspects that need attention. Along with sexually explicit content, this sub-section covers obscene and indecent content. We have discussed obscenity and Indian laws at length here. For a content to be considered obscene, it must result in lustful thoughts or appeal to the prurient interest. Moreover, this sub-section lists out a series of activities pertaining to child pornography. These include collecting, seeking, browsing, downloading, advertising, promoting, exchanging, and distributing. It does not limit itself to visual media and goes on to cover text-based material. The following are examples of criminal offences under this sub-section:Storing photos and videos on the cloud, mobile phone, or laptopSearching for child pornography on the internet or asking aroundWatching and downloading child pornographyExchanging content with each other in the form of a barterEncouraging other users to watch child pornographyAdvertising on different platforms such as websites, chat forums, and social mediaThis sub-section uses three similar words but have different meanings in practice: cultivate, entice, and induce. It is a criminal offence to try to win over (cultivate), tempt or attract (entice), or persuade (induce) a child into an online relationship with another child or children. The purpose behind such relationships is sexually explicit acts or any activity that a reasonable adult would find offensive. Besides, this sub-section appears to be apt for online grooming incidents where perpetrators befriend children with the purpose of sexual exploitation.This sub-section makes it a criminal offence to abuse children online. This can be understood with the case of Fathima A.S. v. State of Kerala. In this case, the mother uploaded a video showing her children painting on her naked body. She uploaded this video on YouTube. In her anticipatory bail application, she contended that her objective was to spread awareness about body discrimination and sex education. However, the Kerala High Court rejected this contention as well as the bail application. Also, the court stated that the act of uploading this video on YouTube is a prima facie use of children for sexual gratification.This sub-section covers recording a sexually explicit act with children. It applies to a perpetrator recording their own act or a third-party recording the act between the perpetrator and the victim. This means that individuals can be held accountable under this sub-section even if they were not a part of the main act and only recorded the act.First conviction: Imprisonment up to five years and a fine of up to ₹10 lakhsSecond and subsequent convictions: Imprisonment up to seven years and a fine of up to ₹10 lakhsSection 67B contains two exceptions. The first exception is for the publication of material in electronic form for the public good, or in the interest of literature, science, art, or learning. It can be books, pamphlets, papers, writings, drawings, paintings, or figures. The second exception is for authentic heritage or religious purposes. For example, if there are sexually explicit paintings in a heritage monument, they will be beyond the scope of this provision.Vidhi Jain worked on an initial draft of this article.

    "headline": "How does identity theft affect your employment?",
    "data": "Identity theft has become common among us and is on the rise. Identity theft occurs when an individual steals your personal information for getting benefits such as insurance and employment in your name. Hackers deceitfully access information to steal the individual’s identity and sell the details for money, use it to secure jobs, loans, and even commit serious crimes. Section 66C in the Information Technology Act, 2000 defines identity theft as fraudulently or dishonestly using unique identification features such as electronic signature and password. Forbes recently termed identity theft as the scourge of the age. A victim of identity theft may face financial and economic losses, but the feeling of invasion and violation worries them the most. Such a feeling lasts longer than any other losses incurred.Identity theft can negatively affect a person’s credibility. Incidents of identity theft can have lasting effects, such as impacting your job opportunities. A CNBC study found 14% of identity theft victims faced problems applying for jobs. 8.5% of them said that it cost them a job opportunity. The victim was a debt collector and private investigator in a case study covered here. She was a victim of identity theft 15 years ago. She initially thought that her prospective employers, i.e. banks, would be understanding. However, as it turned out, it was not the case. She found out that banks first checked her credit score and hired another candidate.Many employers indeed check the credit reports to see if their candidates have a clean slate and stable financial condition. Employers can check credit scores for existing employees as well. Suppose a perpetrator steals your personal information to get a credit card issued in your name. They do not pay the bills on time, which affects your credit score. With a poor credit score, employers may hesitate in offering you a job.Identity theft involves the misuse of your personal information. It may not necessarily involve a credit card always. A perpetrator can create fake profiles in your name on professional platforms. They may get involved in activities that you normally do not do. If you do not get a chance to explain to your prospective employer that it was a fake account, it can hamper your chances of getting the job. These days, checking an applicant’s online presence is integral to background checks and due diligence exercises.The impact of identity theft is not limited to individuals. Identity theft, at times, can impact your company as well. For example, in State by Cyber Crime Police v. Abubakar Siddique, the management trainee of a bank broke up his engagement with a girl. The girl was an employee of the same bank. She created fake email accounts and used the bank’s systems to send emails to foreign clients. As a result, their employer ended up losing most of these clients.In the Indian Penal Code, 1860, no specific provision deals with identity theft. However, Sections 463, 464, 467, 469, and 474 have a broader ambit to accommodate identity theft cases. Sections 419 and 420 considers identity theft as cheating as it is cheating by personation. While reporting an incident of identity theft, Sections 66C and 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000 are worth looking at. I have discussed Section 66C at the beginning of this article. It provides for up to three years of imprisonment and a fine of up to ₹1 lakh. Section 66D prescribes punishment for cheating by personation using a computer resource or communication device. The jail term and fine for Section 66D are the same as Section 66C.Incidents of identity theft can undoubtedly impact an individual mentally, socially, and financially. The Fair Credit Billing Act protects identity theft victims through zero-liability policies in the US. You can work with the concerned agencies and banks to remove the fraudulent transactions from your credit card reports. However, in India, the process is not very straightforward due to the absence of any regulatory initiative on this issue. You may raise a chargeback claim with your credit card issuer. However, this procedure is time-intensive and, most likely, not instantaneous. Your credit card issuer can take a few months to internally investigate and decide if your claim is right.Featured Image Credits: Web vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Residential CCTV and Neighbours’ Privacy Invasion",
    "data": "The notion behind privacy is that a person should have the right to claim sovereignty over oneself. The idea for this is that the inherent value of an individual allows them to exercise privacy. Thus, such a claim must be respected. As a type of self-ownership, privacy allows individuals to have a say in topics directly related to them than anybody else. Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) entails recording activities in open public settings, including homes and offices for security purposes. However, residential CCTV may lack elements to claim privacy as it is a remote device neither close nor specifically targeted. The claim of privacy violation due to CCTV becomes a tussle of law between individual sovereignty when closed intimate spaces like homes come into question.This issue came up before the Delhi High Court in the case of Smt. Dheeraj Bala v. Rajinder Kumar (2015). The defendants installed a CCTV camera on the wall adjacent to the common stairway without the plaintiff’s approval. The stairway led to the second floor of the building. The court held that the installation of CCTV in commonly shared places in a neighbourhood cannot infringe personal space.The bench concurred that fear of an image being morphed and disseminated, which caused the plaintiff anguish, is understandable and valid. The court also accepted the submission that the defendant’s act was unintentional. After weighing the rights and intentions, the court held that the camera on the common stairwell wall needed to be removed immediately. However, they permitted the installation on the second-floor roof or at the main gate.No. There are no specific laws in India regulating residential CCTV cameras. Further, there are no clear criteria to collect (file format), maintain (video length), and exhibit CCTV camera footage as evidence. Due to a lack of standards, the investigation agencies often cannot conduct an efficient investigation. However, some general provisions can be helpful:Section 66E of the Information Technology Act, 2000: This provision talks about capturing or transmitting a person’s private parts without their permission.Section 67 & 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000: If CCTV footage is obscene or sexually explicit, and it is published or transmitted, these provisions are applicable. In case of obscenity, Section 67 provides for up to three years imprisonment and a fine of up to ₹5 lakhs.  For sexually explicit content, Section 67A provides for up to five years imprisonment and a fine of up to ₹10 lakhs. You can read more about obscenity here.Three factors can help decide the legality of your neighbour’s security camera watching over your property. These are:The purpose of the camera(s)The activities it recordsWhat does your neighbour do with the recorded videos?Consider that your neighbour installs a CCTV camera for security purposes. This camera captures your front door, driveway, or yard, all of which are viewable from public areas. In this situation, there is no substantial ground to file a case against your neighbour as you cannot expect privacy in a publicly viewable area. Another considerable aspect in the tussle between CCTV and privacy is the handling of footage by your neighbour. If your neighbour specifically directs their camera towards your personal space, it may be surveillance and a violation of privacy. While your neighbour can film you in plain sight on your property, things are different in places you have a reasonable expectation of privacy. These places can include bathrooms, bedrooms, lavatories, locker rooms, changing and dressing rooms, and so on.Privacy laws in India are at a very nascent stage of their development. One cannot expect well-defined laws for every situation. There is no specific law against malefic neighbours who use CCTV cameras for nuisance and obscenity. However, one may seek recourse under the Indian Constitution and the Information Technology Act, 2000. This being said, we may need a guideline prescribing methods to dispose of CCTV data.There are certain implied rights that you can exercise, such as:Ask your neighbour to inform you if there are installing CCTV cameras. They can put signboards that are easily visible and readable.Request your neighbour to delete CCTV footage.Request your neighbour not to record your video. However, given the nature of CCTV cameras, this can be extremely difficult.Installing CCTV cameras is not illegal.It must not infringe on your neighbour’s right to privacy if you install a CCTV camera in a shared space like a stairway and roof.You should consider taking the neighbour’s consent if you plan on installing a camera in the shared space.Using CCTV cameras to record individuals when they have a reasonable expectation of privacy is a criminal offence.Put easily readable signboards to indicate the use of CCTV cameras.Featured Image Credits: City photo created by whatwolf – www.freepik.com"

    "data": "Your mobile phone consists of hundreds of different parts. There is a good chance that the manufacturing of these parts takes place at multiple locations. In this manufacturing process of mobile phones, mobile assembling units (MAU) assemble the constituent components of mobile phones to make the final product. Some parts may be available in the domestic market, while an MAU may need to import other parts. To boost this industry segment, the Government of India has taken many initiatives in the last few years.The National Policy on Electronics aims to increase the country’s manufacturing capacity and encourage the export of electronic devices and their components. Further, in line with India’s ambitious initiatives like Make in India, Digital India, and Atmanirbhar Bharat, domestic production opportunities have been generated. Under the National Policy on Electronics, India allows for a 100% foreign direct investment for setting up mobile phone manufacturing units, their components, and sub-assemblies. As a result, India has become the second-largest manufacturer of smartphones and mobile phones.A notification dated April 01, 2020, introduced the Production Linked Incentive (PLI) scheme for large scale electronics manufacturing units, including assembly units. The eligible companies received an incentive of 4% to 6% on additional sales over the base year for five years. After the first phase of this scheme was successful, the second phase was launched. Similarly, The government decided to provide a 5% to 3% incentive on additional sales of certain electronic components over the base year for four years.The Union Budget of 2015-16 introduced the Phased Manufacturing Programme. This programme aimed to increase the domestic value addition by setting up a conducive mobile manufacturing ecosystem in India. Under this programme, domestic companies receive indirect financial incentives for cellular mobile handsets, components, and sub-assemblies. The government imposes the basic customs duty on the imported components in a phased-wise manner. Initially, it was limited to low-cost components like battery packs and wired headsets, but gradually, this programme has covered high-cost components.The government adopted a differential excise duty structure to provide direct benefits to domestic manufacturers. Imports of mobile phone components attracted countervailing import duty of 12.5% and excise duty of 1%, without the input tax credit. As a result, the domestically produced mobile phone components are available at cheaper rates when compared to imported products.In her 2021 Budget speech, Ms Nirmala Sitharaman, the Finance Minister, talked about the progress of the mobile phone industry in the country. The Finance Act, 2021 revoked custom duty exemptions on various parts of mobile phones like camera modules, connectors, USB cables, wired headsets, microphones, receivers, chargers, and printed circuit board assembly (PCBA), in continuation with the Phased Manufacturing Programme.From April 21, 2021, the applicable customs duty is as follows:PCBA: 2.5% + an additional 10%Camera modules, connectors, lithium-ion battery, and battery packs: 2.5%Moulded plastic used for chargers and adapters: 15%Other inputs and charger parts: 10%The National Policy on Electronics (2019) acknowledged that 268 new units came into existence between 2015 to 2019. For instance, Samsung has set up the world’s largest mobile factory in Noida, UP. It is further investing ₹4,915 crores in expanding this plant. It is also working on manufacturing the mobile display in India. The labour costs have increased in Vietnam. Therefore, Samsung appears to reduce its reliance on one country and expand its operations to other countries like India.Similarly, Xiaomi decided to establish two new manufacturing units in February 2021, in addition to their already established units. Xiaomi is manufacturing components worth 75% of the mobile phone’s value in India. In addition, Apple has also started assembling iPhone 12 series via a third-party company.The policies and schemes have increased the production, but the local value addition continues to be a challenge. At present, the growth in the mobile phone industry relies on the hiked prices of products. However, to achieve real economic growth, India needs to facilitate manufacturing quality products domestically. Initiatives like Make in India have proved fruitful in increasing the industry footprint in the country. The mobile phone manufacturers and assembling companies have a positive outlook on the Indian market because of low labour and production costs. In addition, leading mobile phone manufacturers are slowly shifting their operations out of China. As a result, this has created an opportunity for India to step up. Setting up manufacturing plants is one key step in a long journey to become the global manufacturing and assembling hub for mobile phones.Featured Image Credits: Technology vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "What is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA)?",
    "data": "Have you ever wondered what happens when someone verbatim copies our articles and re-publishes them on their website without our permission? Well, it is a copyright violation. Copyright is an intellectual property right that grants the owner an exclusive right to use the work. Copyright protection is available for TV shows, movies, videos, sound recordings, lectures, articles, books, paintings, posters, computer software, video games, plays, musicals, etc. Laws across the globe grant protection to different intellectual properties such as literature, dramatic/artistic works, trademarks, designs, patents, etc.One such law that protects copyrights is the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) in the USA. This Act adopts the principles laid down in the WIPO Copyright Treaty and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty, both signed in 1996. DMCA came into force in 1998, and it aims to protect the rights of copyright owners in the digital space. DMCA was the first major copyright-related law in the US that came into effect after the Copyright Act of 1976. The US lawmakers realised that digital medium allowed for making infinite copies of copyright-protected work and the existing copyright law was limited to prescribing fines and punishments for copyright violations.The second portion of DMCA Title I, also referred to as DMCA anti-circumvention provisions modified the remedies available for circumventing technical protection measures. The Act makes it a criminal offence for individuals to circumvent digital rights management and access control measures, irrespective of whether there is a violation of copyrights. However, there are certain activities that are exempted from this general rule, such as:Conducting encryption research to find the vulnerabilities in the protective layer of the copyrighted workConducting security research exercises for applications, software, and computer systemsBypassing protection measures in good faith and bonafide intentionsUsing for educational purposes at librariesDMCA provides remedies for situations such as:If someone disseminates your personally identifiable information without your consent, you have a remedy under Section 1201(i). The ambit of personally identifiable information also includes your activities in the cyber space.When a person shares, transmits or uses copyrighted work without the permission of the rightful copyright owner, it becomes a case of copyright violation.DMCA Title III provides protection to individuals involved in the repairing and maintenance of computer programs. Title III expands the scope of an existing exemption in Section 117 of the Copyright Act. It allows protection when copies of computer programs are made during the maintenance or repairing of a computer system.DMCA distinguishes between analog and digital broadcasters while deciding the liability for violating copyrights. Section 1201(k) specifies the liability when information broadcasting through an analog medium violates copyrights. Devices in analog medium can include VHS players, cassettes, CDs, etc. The Act recognises the economic and technological hardships faced by analog broadcasters due to the emergence of digital broadcasters. Hence, if an analog broadcaster did not intend to violate the copyrights, DMCA grants them an exemption from their liability.As for digital broadcasters, including intermediaries and ISPs, the Act provides exemptions in the following situations:third-parties posting copyrighted content on their network,when a broadcaster did not have any role in the transmission,a broadcaster did not change the transmitted content, anda broadcaster did not retain or make a copy of the content in question.Search engines like Google, Yahoo, and Bing help us get the information we seek. DMCA grants protections to search engines in certain cases as it considers them as online service providers (OSPs). DMCA Title II, or the Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act, provides for a safe harbour for online service providers. Title II adds a new section to the Copyright Act for deciding the liability of OSPs. It classifies OSPs into four categories: system caching, information location tools, storage of information on systems or networks at users’ directions, and transitory communications.OSPs must adhere to the safe harbour guidelines to claim protection against copyright infringement liability. These guidelines include:not deriving any profits from the circulation of the copyrighted material,they take down the content in question when it comes to their knowledge, andwhen they take down the content, they inform the copyright owners of the takedown.Under DMCA, a copyright owner has both civil and criminal remedies available. Section 1203 talks about civil remedies such as injunction, damages, and destruction of devices. Section 1204 focuses on criminal remedies and includes fines and imprisonment. A party whose copyrights are affected can send a takedown notice to the concerned online service provider. This notice must fulfil the requirements specified in Section 512(c). In one of our upcoming articles, we will elaborate on the DMCA takedown procedure.DMCA provides for the protection of copyright in cyber space and is an intricate piece of law. The Act itself was very advanced for its time and is something from which India needs to take inspiration. In the Indian scenario, there are a lot of ambiguities in the existence and functioning of traditional works in the digital medium. India also needs to develop a dedicated law for governing copyrights in digital spaces.Featured Image Credits: Social media vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Blockchain for dummies",
    "data": "In 2022, it will be silly to ask you if you have heard about Bitcoin, Dogecoin, Shiba Inu, and other cryptocurrencies. A cryptocurrency is a form of digital currency that runs on Blockchain technology. Blockchain is a system for recording and transacting information. It is named ‘blockchain’ because it consists of blocks storing information. This system was unused for the longest time until Satoshi Nakamoto adapted it in 2009 to create Bitcoin. Many people believe that blockchain is a system solely used to store cryptocurrency. This misbelief is primarily because cryptocurrency as an application became popular earlier than blockchain as a technology.The blockchain system is also used for securing and transferring anything from Bitcoins to property, contracts and other valuable documents since it is difficult to tamper or hack the system.This way, they do not involve a third-party intermediary like a bank. The three parts of blockchain are:The record: The information stored/transacted (The black box)The block: A group of all the records (The blue box)The chain: A bundle of blocks linked together (The arrow links them and forms a chain)Chain of blocks in a blockchainBy now, it is clear that every block in the blockchain contains several recorded information transactions. The first block of the chain is the genesis block. Every new block links with the previous block to form a chain. It is difficult to modify the previous blocks when adding a new block, making them more secure.Each block has data; an alphanumerical value called hash and the previous block’s hash. Hash is like a fingerprint that gives a unique identity to the block. Once you record the data inside the blockchain, it is difficult to alter the information. It is because the hash value identifies the contents of the block. Hence, if the contents change, it will cause the hash to change. With that, the block’s hash value containing the altered information and the previous block’s hash value in the next block becomes different, making all the blocks invalid.Have you wondered who will have the authority to control a blockchain system? Interestingly, no person is in charge. The person who uses the system controls it. The information is publicly available, so there is no specific authority to control it. Therefore, blockchain is an example of a decentralised system.Blockchain technology has become the talk of the town as cryptocurrency, one of its applications, has become a trendsetter. Reasons for the popularity of this technology are:Reliability: It is a reliable system because it is nearly impossible to duplicate, tamper or hack the system as it verifies the interested parties.Unchangeable transactions: It is challenging to alter transactions after registering blocks.Transparency: Blockchains are transparent as they are publicly viewable. Therefore, if any person tries to change the data, one can easily view the change.While the world is in awe of this emerging technology, it comes with certain drawbacks. They are:Complex: The system is very complex to comprehend. It is not just the technology but also the uses of complex terminologies that are hard to understand for an ordinary man. Therefore, users are unable to appreciate its benefits.Slow transaction: The transactions of information in blockchain are slower than the traditional transaction methods because of their complexity.Using blockchain technology sounds exciting. Just like how cashless transactions turned into a reality from a dream, using blockchain to send money may turn into one happy reality. Blockchain has other applications, including smart contracts, copyrights, healthcare, land records management, and finance. Analysis shows that there is a broad scope for improvements. The major hurdle to overcome is the lack of knowledge. The technicalities involved are why many people hesitate to show interest in the technology. It means that there is a long way to make this a standard technology. As time tells us, any innovative step with the advent of technology would face a lot of apprehension in people’s minds.The developments in this system must be slow and steady because gaining the public’s trust in the technology is essential rather than suppressing the process. To conclude, any mala fide intention while using blockchain should be thwarted at any cost. At the same time, how effectively the blockchain can be put into use and seal all possible loopholes in the system should be studied so that the country’s economic system is not put to a risky test.Featured Image Credits: Design vector created by macrovector – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "A Beginner’s Guide to Cyber Squatting in India",
    "data": "A Beginner’s Guide to Cyber Squatting in IndiaA domain name is the website address that allows visitors to find a person, company, or organisation on the internet. One may observe that every other company has a domain name, which sometimes becomes brands in and of themselves over time. Almost every business nowadays has a domain name registered and is actively pushing it to its clients. As domain names grow more popular, securing them against misuse and financial damage to the business becomes increasingly important. Cyber squatting is a problem that both small and large enterprises encounter when it comes to domain names.Cyber squatting happens when an individual registers a domain name that is identical to, or confusingly similar to, another person’s existing domain. In many cases, it is often the trademark. Then, this individual offers to sell the domain name back to the trademark owner.A cyber squatter, for example, may acquire cyberblogindia.com if we have not yet built a website, intending to sell the domain to us for a profit at a later date, or use the domain name to draw traffic and earn revenue through advertising.For most internet users, making a typographical error is a regular occurrence, with some such errors being quite prevalent. Typo squatters will purchase domains that include a typographical mistake. For example, one can purchase linkdin.com instead of linkedin.com and use this new domain to set up a phishing site. The purpose is usually malicious, to skim users who make a mistake.For example, Sergey Gridasov from Russia had operated domain names googkle.com, ghoogle.com, and gooigle.com. He developed these websites to infect computers with malware.  In 2005, Google regained control of the domains.A gripe site is where individuals, places, governments, companies, or organisations may be criticised or mocked. Gripe sites are also useful for charitable purposes. Moreover, they are not necessarily unlawful.For example, Pastor Jerry Falwell sought to shut down fallwell.com because it was being used to refute his homophobic allegations. He was unsuccessful as the courts determined that fallwell.com had no commercial element, that is, no bad faith or intent to profit, and so the owner was not infringing on any trademarks.Another instance involving a gripe site is careeragentsnetwork.biz, which was set up by a discontented and resentful client of careeragentsnetwork.com (“CAN”). Moreover, the client heavily invested in search engine optimisation that led to it coming in the top search results. The client alleged that CAN did nothing with its own web presence at careeragentsnetwork.com when they purchased the domain. The court concluded that as complainants did not attempt to boost their own business, therefore, the respondent could not be held liable.Litigation in a court of law is one of the options available against cyber squatters. In India, courts have granted several injunctions preventing cyber squatters from exploiting domain names.For Example, in the case of Info Edge (India) Pvt. Ltd. & Anr v. Shailesh Gupta & Anr (98 (2002) DLT 499), the Bombay High Court granted an injunction prohibiting the defendant from using the domain name “RADIFF” or any other similar name. The court held that there is a strong possibility the new domain will create confusion. Moreover, the domain in question can deceive users into believing that both domain names belong to the same source and connection.In the case of Naukri.com, the domain naukari.com was found to be confusingly similar to the plaintiff’s domain naukri.com with a different spelling variant, generating a prima facie inference of ill faith.The National Internet Exchange of India, or NIXI, is in charge of the .in top-level domain. Therefore, the INDRP Rules of Procedure and the .in Dispute Resolution Policy are available for handling .in domain disputes. According to the INDRP, anybody who believes that a registered domain name infringes on their legitimate rights or interests may submit a complaint to .IN Registry on three grounds. They are:the registrant’s domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a name, trademark, or service mark in which the Complainant has rights;They have no rights or legitimate interests in the domain name; andTheir domain name was registered or is being used in bad faith.The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) has developed a Uniform Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) for dealing with cyber squatting. UDRP is a part of the domain registration agreement. It establishes the terms and circumstances in the event of a dispute. It considers registration and use of a domain between the individual who registered, the registrant and any party other than the registrar. While registering a domain name, the registrant agrees to submit to procedures initiated under UDRP.Cyber squatting is not a new issue that has suddenly come up. With the increasing internet presence of businesses, it becomes critical to maintain the brand identity and trademark. As domains are globally accessible, it appears that the extent of trademark infringement has expanded. While it is financially futile for small businesses to buy each possible domain, it is worthwhile to purchase location-specific domains. For example, if you are from India, you can consider buying .in, .co.in, along with the traditional .com domain.Featured Image Credits: Website vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Much Ado About Sexting",
    "data": "Much Ado About SextingToday, we live in a world where even a kindergarten child needs a mobile phone to study. Thanks to the pandemic, we all have become slaves of technology. Is it even possible to imagine our lives without our mobile phone, laptop, and the Internet? While technology helps us in every aspect of our lives, are we failing to use it judiciously? Since I categorise myself as the believer of old school love, I never imagined that the feeling of love and intimacy would be born, grown, and killed online. The combination of technology and romantic relationships is mismatched. Social media platforms are meant to stay in touch with people and not perform activities that are not meant to be done online. This article will talk about how sexting has gained popularity in recent times and how it can be harmful.We can define sexting as sending texts, pictures, or videos that are sexually explicit through online platforms over the Internet. These platforms can include social media platforms like Facebook and Instagram and messaging apps like WhatsApp. The consequences of sexting, which I’ll talk about later, are not as simple as the definition of sexting. People look at sexting as a way of maintaining a healthy relationship with their partners. This is not wrong until they see it as a means of communication, love, and other big adjectives involved in a relationship. Many believe that sexting is the only sign of trust in a relationship or a good way to get compliments. If the partner actively participates in sexting, it is the world’s best relationship.A 2018 investigative study found that 1 out of every 4 teenagers received a sexually explicit text while 1 out of every 7 sent a sexually explicit text. Also, at least 1 teenager out of 10 forwarded these sexts without consent.Sexting is not wrong per se if it happens consensually between two adults. However, it may result in a crime if:Section 354C of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 prescribes punishment for an individual who disseminates the pictures of a woman when she did not give her consent for the dissemination. For example, A allows B to capture her images but does not consent for their dissemination. However, B forwards the pictures to C and D. This act of B will be punishable under this provision for a minimum of one-year imprisonment along with a fine.You can land in trouble if you publish or transmit obscene material online, as per Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This section provides for imprisonment up to three years and a fine of up to five lakh rupees. One of our previous articles discusses obscenity and Indian law in detail here.Section 67A is more relevant to sexting as it specifically mentions sexually explicit acts. This section provides for imprisonment up to five years and a fine of up to ten lakh rupees.In this context, Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 is very crucial. It is very easy to create a fake account and use somebody else’s picture. As such, it may be difficult for you to identify the real age of the other party. You might end up sharing your sexually explicit pictures with a minor without even realising it.Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 provides punishment for various acts involving minors. For example, it is a crime to seek, browse, collect, or distribute content showing children in an obscene, indecent, or sexually explicit manner. This provision covers facilitating online abuse and enticing children into online relationships. Similar to Sections 67 and 67A, it provides punishment for the publication of sexually explicit content involving minors. The Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 also comes into the picture when it comes to minors.Legal issues are one thing, but there are other consequences as well. Suppose you share your pictures with your partner and ask them to delete them as soon as they see them. What is the guarantee that your partner will delete it without sharing it with anybody or saving it somewhere else?Let’s take another example. You have shared your pictures. You and your partner have a relationship built on trust, and they always delete the pictures whenever you send them. What if someone steals their mobile phone or your partner loses it somehow? What if a third party (who can be anybody) gets access to your partner’s mobile and gets their hands on your pictures which they use in the future to blackmail you? I am not talking about hypothetical situations here. We are regularly receiving cases like this.Another most common situation is a partner blackmailing the other partner after they part their ways. We receive around 8-10 cases every day from all over the country stating that their ex-partner is blackmailing and threatening to leak their private pictures. Sometimes it is for money and sometimes for sexual favours. We have observed an increasing trend in cases involving minors who share or receive such pictures and find themselves with no other option apart from ending their lives.You will certainly find incidents like this in the news. For example, school authorities in New York fired a teacher after her pictures went viral among the students. She had shared these pictures with her partner, who further disseminated them. In June 2021, the Bhopal Police arrested a man for blackmailing a 19-year-old victim. She stated in her complaint that the accused lured her into sexting and captured her pictures on WhatsApp video call without her consent. In another instance, the Delhi Police arrested a predator who used to target school girls. He would send them friend requests through fake profiles and subsequently morphed their pictures and blackmailed them. He demanded sexual favours, including video sexting. The police were able to identify seven of this perpetrator’s victims. There is another case wherein a 14-year-old girl was lured into sexting by her classmate. The classmate, along with his brother, started blackmailing her. When she did not give in to their demands, they uploaded the victim’s pictures on Instagram.Somebody getting blackmailed for their private pictures has harmful effects on their mental health, especially if they are minors. Various studies have proved this to be true. A 2019 survey revealed that people involved in sexting remain extremely upset, scared, and embarrassed, leading to depression, anxiety, and suicidal thoughts. These have become a common phenomenon after the first lockdown, and as per the data of cases that we receive, it has worsened due to sexting.Sexting is your choice. Whatever you choose to do, be careful. Additionally, keep in mind that once you send a picture or video, it just stays there in one form or another. The receiver may have a syncing iCloud or Google Drive. If it comes to the point that the other party uploads on the Internet, search engines will index, and web archiving tools will make a copy. Other websites may scrap the content in a very short duration of time, but the content will also get stored in the cache of various websites and servers. I do not want to come in the way of your relationship, but I would say that trust no one! And, in case you or someone you know is in trouble, do not hesitate in reaching out for help.

    "headline": "What is a clickwrap agreement?",
    "data": "What is a clickwrap agreement?Whenever we visit a website, we usually end up clicking on multiple I agree buttons. We do not even realise what we agree to. These may range from terms and conditions, privacy agreements, copyright agreements, etc. There is a good chance that when you signed up for Instagram, you were a minor. Indian laws do not recognise contracts entered into by minors, but that is a debate for some other time. In this article, we take a look at what clickwrap agreements are and if they are valid.You will usually see clickwrap agreements in pop-up boxes or buttons that require the user to click to give their consent. It is easier to get confused between clickwrap agreements and browsewrap agreements. However, it is pertinent to note that browsewrap agreements do not require a user to take any action. In the case of browsewrap agreements, continued use of a website can be considered as your acceptance. I am sure you would have come across something like this:Your continued use of this site shows that you have accepted our Terms and Conditions.Coming back to clickwrap agreements, they will require you to take affirmative action. For example, you will need to click the checkbox to convey that you have read and accepted the terms and conditions. Or, in the case of a dedicated button, you will click on the button demonstrating that you have read and agreed. If you refuse to accept the terms, the website or platform will not let you avail of any of their services.For instance, check this snippet taken from the account creation process for LinkedIn. It requires users to click on the Agree & Join button to show that they agree to their Use Agreement, Privacy Policy, and Cookie Policy.“Agree and Join” button while creating a LinkedIn AccountThere have been multiple cases in the US where courts have dealt with the validity of clickwrap agreements. In most of these cases, courts are of the opinion that if a user is accepting the agreement, they would be bound by its terms and conditions. A user’s affirmative action is sufficient to assume that they read the terms and conditions. Some of these cases include Lawrence Feldman v. Google Inc (2007), Specht v. Netspace (2002), and Nicosia v. Amazon.com (2016).In this case, the plaintiff bought an advertisement package from Google to bring in potential clients. Google charged the plaintiff for every click their advertisement received. However, the results were not satisfactory for the plaintiff, and he brought in a claim for fraud clicks. Fraud clicks are when someone not interested in your service clicks on your ad either by mistake or on purpose. He further argued that neither he nor his agent signed any contract with Google.Google argued that the plaintiff accepted the terms when they created their account for advertisement services. Before the District Court for Eastern District of Pennsylvania, the main question was whether a forum selection clause is enforceable in a clickwrap agreement. The plaintiff argued that they did not accept the contract, and hence, it would not be valid. The court held that the clause was applicable and valid.The defendant provides a free software service on their website. A user can download this service from their website. The plaintiff submitted that their personal information was being transmitted to the software provider. The defendants wanted a stay on the court proceedings and initiate the arbitration proceedings as stated in the software license contract. Eventually, the court held that the plaintiff did not receive enough notice of the existence of the terms. They only came across these terms after they downloaded the software. Further, the court was of the opinion that merely clicking on the Download button does not mean that a user has accepted the terms and conditions.The plaintiff ordered a weight loss product from Amazon. This product contained some substances that had been discontinued in the country after he purchased. His main contention was that he was neither informed about this nor provided a refund by Amazon. He approached the court for an injunction so that Amazon stopped selling their product on their website. He also wished to send remedial notices to all the consumers of this product. Amazon contained that the plaintiff had agreed to Amazon’s Conditions of Use Agreement. As per this agreement, the parties opted for arbitration proceedings instead of a court case. The court held that the arbitration clause was valid as the hyperlink was clearly visible to the customers, both while signing up for an account and placing an order.Put plainly, clickwrap agreements are very much valid if they follow the basic rules of contract law. A website must require users to take affirmative action to show that they have read and accepted the terms and conditions. At the same time, one cannot deny a lack of negotiation power on a user’s part when they enter into a clickwrap agreement. It is also possible that many contracts and agreements may be regressive in nature. As online services become a household thing in India, I believe it is time we have our own precedents for online contracts.Featured Image Credits: People vector created by pch.vector – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Is it illegal to watch porn on Telegram?",
    "data": "Is it illegal to watch porn on Telegram?When an individual moves from physical space to cyber space, there comes a behavioural change in the person. Individuals often find cyber space more liberating and less judgemental towards their actions. This shift in behaviour is called the space transition theory. An India Today report found a 95% spike in internet traffic to pornographic sites within the first three weeks of the first lockdown. When it comes to watching pornographic content, there are so many myths and misunderstandings in India. This article seeks to answer one of the most asked questions on our WhatsApp Helpline and email.First things first, let’s talk about pornography laws in general. Our article on Pornography Rules in India and its Hindi version are the two most-read articles on our blog. Time and again, we have answered whether watching pornography is legal in India. For one more time, it is legal if you watch in your personal space. The police shall not arrest you unless you are doing it in a public place. However, sharing pornographic content over the internet is a criminal offence, including social media platforms, WhatsApp, Telegram, etc. If you share pornographic content with others, you may go to jail for up to five years or be fined up to ₹10 lakhs.Also, make sure that the content you are watching is neither child pornography nor rape/gang rape. Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 states that even seeking, searching, or collecting child pornography is a criminal offence.Coming across pornographic content on WhatsApp and Telegram is not a rare case. In some groups and channels, you will come across users who ask users for a certain fee for accessing their content. You will also see channels offering premium content at a substantially lesser price. These individuals accept payments through platforms like PayPal and various cryptocurrencies.According to Telegram’s Terms of Service, a user impliedly agrees not to post pornographic content on publicly viewable Telegram channels. Nevertheless, Telegram is just a curtain for several unlawful activities due to:End-to-end encryption: While end-to-end encryption is good for user privacy, it also provides a platform for illegal activities to happen behind the shield of encryption.Anonymity: Users on Telegram have an option to join a Telegram channel without revealing their mobile number. A user can join as many channels as they want without sharing their number or any other personal information.Secret chats: With the help of this feature, messages in a Telegram conversation disappear automatically within a short period. Tracking down messages sent in secret chats is almost impossible.While Telegram does not allow a user to report another user, you can certainly report Telegram channels. The platform asks you to choose one of the following reasons for reporting a channel: spam, fake account, violence, child abuse, pornography, and others. For reporting a channel, tap on the three dots in the top-right corner and select the Report option. You should see the following options.Reporting a channel on TelegramThe legal position remains the same, irrespective of the platform. If you watch pornographic content in your personal space on Telegram, it should not be a problem. However, sharing with other users in one-to-one conversations or channels takes you into the illegal side of things.You will often see messaging apps claiming to be the safest ones in the market. People often hide in the guise of end-to-end encryption and anonymity for distributing pornographic content on these apps. While watching pornography in your personal space is okay, we must not avoid reporting the incidents of child pornography and rape/gang rape videos. You can go to the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal and file an anonymous complaint.Featured Image Credits: Image by Ümit Solmaz from Pixabay"

    "headline": "How did the Information Technology Act, 2000 come into existence?",
    "data": "The last hundred years have seen rapid developments in science and technology. Information technology started gaining prominence in the 1980s and 1990s. The Opposition and trade unions resisted the shift as they feared the loss of employment opportunities. One report documented that this approach was different in the wake of technological revolution across the globe. Post the second industrial revolution, international trade became highly dependent on technology.Further, the third and fourth industrial revolutions were based on information technology and digitalisation. Above all, the emergence of the internet intensified competition in the international market. With such advancements, India could not refrain from adapting to changing circumstances. In this article, we look at the journey of how the Information Technology Act, 2000 (“Act”) came into existence.After Rajiv Gandhi became India’s Prime Minister in 1984, the Computer Revolution was a key highlight of his ambitious plan. Subsequently, his government reduced import taxes and duties for computer systems and related accessories. Computers made their way to factories, banks, offices, schools, and homes with the help of an increased push by the government. There was initial resistance; however, there were more than 1,00,00 computers in India by 1989.The 1991 Economic Policy had three main components: globalisation, privatisation, and liberalisation. With the help of a liberalised economy, India’s interaction with countries around the globe increased. As a result, an inflow of technology started happening in the country. In the same year, India launched its Super Computing Programme. These changes also fueled the development of software development companies in India.International trade was no longer confined to papers, and technology introduced new ways of doing trade and commerce beyond geographical boundaries. As the world realised the need for recognising e-commerce, UNCITRAL stepped up. The UN Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL) adopted the Model Law on Electronic Commerce in 1996. As of today, 78 states and 157 jurisdictions have adopted this model law. In June 1998, UNCITRAL revised the Model Law and added Article 5 bis. The objective of this law was to:Facilitate e-commerce transactions.Provide internationally accepted rules for member states when they frame their laws on e-commerce.Recognise e-commerce and treat electronic documents at par with paper documents.This Model Law put forth three principles:Non-discrimination: Article 5 grants validity to the communication of any information through electronic mode. It states that electronic communication should be considered at par with other modes of communication. In other words, one cannot discriminate between electronic communication and other modes of communication.Technological Neutrality: This principle states that the laws must not favour any particular technology.Functional Equivalence: This principle provides for certain ingredients for considering electronic communication at par with paper-based communication.UNCITRAL has further introduced the Model Law on Electronic Signatures (2001) and the Convention on the Use of Electronic Communications in International Contracts (2005). However, India has not been a party to these model laws.India is a dualistic state, which means that international conventions and treaties must be ratified in municipal laws. VIIth Schedule and Article 246 in the Constitution provide the Central and State Governments authority to make laws on various subject matters. In addition. Article 253 gives special legislative power to the Central Government for fulfilling international obligations and commitments. Moreover, Article 51(c) places a duty on the State to respect international law. Initially, the Ministry of Commerce had drafted the Electronic Commerce Bill, 1998. After subsequent revisions, it was laid on the table as the Information Technology Bill, 1999 (“Bill”).Pramod Mahajan, the then Minister of Information Technology, moved the Bill in the Lok Sabha on December 16, 1999. Thereafter, the Lower House gave its nod to the Bill on May 16, 2000. The Upper House passed it on the next day through a voice vote. Afterwards, it received the Presidential assent on June 09, 2000.During his address to the Lok Sabha, the then Minister highlighted the main objectives of this Bill. These objectives were to:Legally recognise e-commerce.Amend acts like the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.Give legal authority to electronic filing, electronic records, and criminalise cyber offences.In his speech to the Rajya Sabha, he threw light on the need for a law on information technology. The following points summarise the debate in the Upper House.Information technology is the basis of the knowledge-based economy. With technological advancements, the world has become a global village. As a result, e-commerce and computers will be the future of the world.The IT industry is a very profitable business venture that needs regulation.Digital language is the fourth generation of communication among humans in economic, political, cultural, personal, and commercial interactions. Therefore, it requires legal recognition.There is a requirement to protect individuals involved in commercial transactions as e-commerce does not exist physically. The law will help the authorities to pin down liability on the culprits.Information technology will enable e-governance and effective administration.People have moved to digital signatures from verbal promises, thumb impressions, and written signatures.The 21st century will witness a surge in cyber crimes. Moreover, this century will be the century of information technology.The debates in Lok Sabha and Rajya Sabha indicate that introducing this law was the need of the hour. However, it would be unreasonable if we rule out international obligation as one of the reasons behind the introduction of the Bill. A news article dated May 16, 2000, on rediff.com details how Indian lawmakers have approved the IT Bill amid pleas to go slow. While the then Minister himself agreed that there might be some flaws, we have only seen a single major amendment in 2008. The effectiveness of this Act is a discussion for some other time."

    "headline": "How to secure your Snapchat account?",
    "data": "In my previous articles in this series, I have discussed how to secure Facebook, WhatsApp, and Instagram accounts. This article will talk about various security and privacy settings on Snapchat. The platform has around 265 million daily active users worldwide. Snapchat has come up with features like Cameo and Bitmoji to make the experience very interactive for users. I am sure you know a few of your friends who just don’t let the streak die.How to find security settings on Snapchat?When you open the app, you should see the following screen. In place of this orange circle, you should see your Bitmoji.Snapchat Home ScreenClick on your Bitmoji, and you should see this screen. Tap on the Settings menu.Your profile on SnapchatNow, you will see all the settings related to your account.Settings on SnapchatLet’s look at these options one by one.You should always set a strong password for your account. Avoid using your name, birthday, mobile number, family members’ names, etc., as your password. Use a combination of capital and small letters, special symbols, and numbers. Remembering passwords can become daunting at times. Here is a trick:Instead of keeping my password as a straightforward vidhijain, I would put: 22!Dh!j@!n.Here is what I did. First, I replaced v by 22 as the alphabet comes at the twenty-second position in alphabetical order. For each instance that i comes in my name, ! replaces it. I replace d with D and keep the h, j, and n as it is.Setting a secure passwordFor more information on how you should create strong passwords, you can check this article.You should make it a habit to use two-factor authentication (2FA) everywhere you can. 2FA prevents a hacker from accessing your account even if they have retrieved your password. For 2FA, you can either receive verification texts on your mobile number or use an app like Google Authenticator. To check the list of devices where you have disabled 2FA, click on the Forget Devices option.2FAThe first option in the “Who can” section allows you to decide who can contact you. My recommendation is to keep it as My Friends.Who can contact me?From this option, you can decide who can use your Cameos selfie. Snapchat also allows you to disable it altogether.Who can use my Cameos Selfie?Using this option, you can select who can view your Snapchat story. My recommendation is to set this as Friends Only.Who can view my story?I will leave this for you to decide if you would like Snapchat users to see your name in the Quick Add list. From here, you can enable or disable it.Who can see me in Quick Add?Ask any security expert, and they will never recommend always sharing your location on any platform. Snapchat allows you to use the app in Ghost Mode – even your friends cannot see your location. My recommendation is to keep the Ghost Mode on and only share location when you actually have to.Who can see my location?Always be cautious of incoming requests from unknown people. You never know who is sitting behind the screen on the other side.There are third-party apps in the market that allow a user to save your snaps. A receiver can also use another phone to capture a picture of your snap. Think before you share!Snapchat lets you clear your conversations, search history, locations, cache, lens data, cameo selfie, etc. You can do this whenever you want."

    "headline": "Personhood of autonomous systems: Morality",
    "data": "This is the fourth article in our series on the personhood of autonomous systems. We started this discussion by exploring the concept of autonomy from multiple facets, such as legal, philosophical, and technological. The second and third articles elaborated on Kant’s concept of autonomy and perceived autonomy in the computer science domain. In this article, we take a look at morality in the context of autonomous systems.One of the biggest questions autonomous systems will face is how will they perform moral reasoning to take ethical actions? Further, there will be a follow-up question to this. Should there be a framework that defines universal moral reasoning for all possible autonomous systems? In ethical theory, one can understand the universality of moral reasoning as a situation where there is always a reason for performing an action when an agent is morally bound to perform the said action. Kant’s theory implies that it is possible to have a type of reasoning that can be universal.On the other hand, particular moral reasoning does not justify moral obligations based on universal reasoning. It looks for individual instances where the rules of morality emerge. It is possible that the rules of morality may differ from one instance to another.Human moral reasoning is a combination of judgement, experience, emotions, and comprehension. It is dependent on cultural, religious, political, and societal factors. History has multiple examples wherein human moral reasoning has tackled moral dilemmas by balancing moral values and societal interests. For autonomous systems, it is reasonable to believe that they will act as a companion to human beings. In this capacity, respecting the privacy of human beings is a reasonable expectation from autonomous systems.However, if that is not the case, this situation directly threatens privacy, human autonomy, and dignity. Or in other words, we need to design autonomous systems in a manner that they cannot deceive, manipulate, or trick humans into doing something they will not do in the regular course of their life. The essence of the free will of human beings and rational thinking must exist in a civilised society.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948) can be considered a common ground for universal moral reasoning. It sets out basic human rights that are indivisible, universal, and inviolable. On the other hand, particular moral reasoning will look to limit factors relevant to reasoning based on the technological capabilities of autonomous systems.Working of autonomous weapons is an interesting example here. Suppose, there exists an autonomous weapon that can only target and destroy buildings. This system will not consider factors such as building appearance, the intention behind its use, or retaliation by human soldiers. Now, let’s give the capability of targeting human soldiers to this autonomous system. This situation will necessitate the system to perform moral reasoning and comply with the proportionality of actions, unnecessary suffering, and distinction.Moral reasoning in machines may or may not deduce the relative value or significance of available human rights. This can lead to inconsistent application and exercise of arbitrary actions by autonomous systems. For instance, an autonomous system may incorporate cultural preferences or bias in arriving at moral conclusions. One possible solution is to design autonomous systems that remain value-neutral while taking decisions that can impact human lives.An autonomous system should not differentiate or favour individuals based on gender, religious, racial, or cultural biases. The German administration for autonomous vehicles has codified this explanation in one of its guidelines. This guideline states thatin the event of unavoidable accident situations, any distinction based on personal features such as age, gender, physical, or mental constitution is prohibited.Featured Image Credits: Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay"

    "headline": "Censorship and Conservatives: Texas’ Social Media Deplatforming Law",
    "data": "Censorship and Conservatives: Texas’ Social Media Deplatforming LawOur modern-day public squares are social media platforms. They serve as forums for healthy public discourse where users exchange knowledge freely. However, there is a worrying trend among social media platforms to stifle conservative ideas and perspectives. To counter this, Texas has passed a deplatforming law prohibiting social media platforms from excluding users based on their political beliefs. The state Governor has further signed this law that will govern how social media platforms censor content. Lately, conservative politicians have accused social media platforms of censoring conservative ideas. After the Trump supports stormed the Capitol in January 2021, Facebook and Twitter responded by suspending former President’s accounts. Social media platforms have continued to deny suffocating conservative viewpoints. However, they do enforce the terms of service for prohibiting incitement to violence and coordinated misinformation.Deplatforming, or no-platforming, is an attempt to boycott a group or individual by removing the avenues they use for sharing information or ideas. One can also define deplatforming as an action or practice of banning an individual with undesirable or objectionable thoughts from participating in forums or discussions on a specific website.Texas passed the new law known as HB20 in early September this year. This law forbids blocking (or demonetising or restricting) content based on a user or another user’s viewpoint. HB20 also requires transparency requirements on social media platforms to reveal how they promote and censor content. It further mandates that platforms must assess illegal content within 48 hours once they are warned. This is similar to at least one proposal in the US Congress. However, unlike Congress, a state legislature in the US cannot override Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act 0f 1996. The Attorney General may initiate a civil lawsuit against platforms that fail to comply with the requirements of this law.This law applies to web services that allow users to “communicate with other users for the principal purpose of uploading information, comments, messages, or images”. A web service must have at least 50 million active users for this law to be applicable. It excludes internet service providers, news, and entertainment sites.HB20 makes it unlawful for email service providers to impede the delivery of emails based on the message contents. However, email service providers can impede the delivery if they believe that a message contains malicious code, obscenity, illegal content, or violates the existing Texas anti-spam law.The Texas anti-spam law prohibits sending emails with fraudulent, deceptive, or misleading information in the subject line. It further bans misrepresentations in the email address. It defines unsolicited commercial electronic messages as emails delivered without authorisation to someone with no established business relationship. This definition excludes emails sent by an organisation to interact with members, employees, and contractors. A business relationship means a former or current connection between two individuals through voluntary, two-way communication.One may claim that this law infringes on the private companies’ constitutional right to allow and decide content on their platforms. Another argument can be the violation of the First Amendment as it requires websites to post obscene, racist, discriminating, anti-semitic, and other types of harmful content.While user content moderation is critical for keeping the internet safe, this law essentially brings content standards under government control. Although the Left Wing may challenge the law, it will come into effect in December 2021. Earlier this year in May, Florida passed a law preventing social media platforms from removing politicians from their platforms. Later, a federal court blocked certain sections after ruling that this law infringed the First Amendment right to free expression.It is also possible that HB20 is a Republican attempt to intimidate social media platforms into removing objectionable but legal content. It can also be a campaign that conservative legislators have portrayed as an anti-censorship crusade against companies similar to phone companies or other communication utilities. The Florida law has a similar model for governing social media platforms, but it has certain unique aspects such as protections for politicians and an exemption for theme park owners.The law’s future, as of now, remains uncertain. It is likely to face legal challenges as it is not structured to evade court scrutiny. The Texas law may have a similar fate as that of the Florida law. NetChoice, one of the plaintiffs that challenged the Florida law, condemned HB20; however, they have not committed to bringing in a similar lawsuit in Texas.Featured Image Credits: Internet vector created by macrovector – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Hashtag Challenges and Human Psychological Responses",
    "data": "Hashtag Challenges and Human Psychological ResponsesSince the time Coronavirus has entered everybody’s lives, people have become comfortable staying at home. There might be something interesting that keeps them entertained at all times, even at their homes. Ever wondered what it would be? Let me make it a bit easier for you. You might have seen people getting outside a moving car and dancing, popularly known as the #KikiChallenge, doing the #thisorthatchallenge, etc. These hashtag challenges keep trending on social media platforms from time to time. But are these challenges serving their purpose of entertaining people or having adverse consequences?I am sure you have heard about the dangerous Blue Whale Challenge, which made people perform certain tasks and ultimately commit suicide. Since this challenge went viral, many suicides, self-harms, and suicide attempts came into the picture.While writing about hashtag challenges, it is imperative to state that not all challenges bring adverse consequences. Hashtag Challenges or trends like #thisorthatchallenge lets people make short videos (or ‘reels’ on Instagram and Facebook) in which they move towards their preferred choices. This challenge is not as dangerous as others, but people end up posting their personal preferences publicly.Another hashtag challenge that turned out to be deadly was #BenadrylChallenge. Someone posted this challenge on TikTok, after which it got viral on all social media platforms. Teenagers and kids took excessive doses of the anti-allergic medicine leading to hallucinations. Consequently, this challenge turned out fatal, even leading to deaths. A 15-year-old girl from Oklahoma, USA, died after taking high doses of this anti-allergic medicine after watching TikTok users dare each other to perform the challenge.This challenge became popular in 2013. People had to consume a spoonful of powdered cinnamon in 60 seconds without drinking anything and upload the video as evidence of participating in the challenge. Excessive cinnamon consumption can lead to throat irritation, collapsed lungs, breathing difficulties, and pneumonia, making the challenge harmful.Besides the challenges mentioned above, there are other challenges as well that are way more dangerous. Some of them are #FireChallenge, #SaltandIceChallenge, #TidePodChallenge, #thechokinggame, etc. However, some challenges are part of a noble campaign and serve the purpose of helping people. Such viral campaigns or trends are known as viral altruism. One such challenge which can fall within the ambit of viral altruism is the #IceBucketChallenge. This challenge reached its peak in 2014 when people poured ice-cold water over their heads.They uploaded the video of the act on different social media platforms, further nominating others for performing the same. Users performed this challenge to gather donations for a motor neurone disease called ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral  Sclerosis). Dr Sander Van Der Linden, a Social Psychologist, has set a recipe for such online altruism by using the SMART acronym. SMART stands for social influences, moral imperatives, affective reactions, and translational impact. According to Dr Linden, empathy is an emotional contagion and responding to people’s feelings with a charitable act reflects a warm glow of optimism in people. FOMO (fear of missing out) might be a reason why humans respond to these challenges in weird ways. The Collins dictionary defines FOMO as “the belief of some people that others are having a good time without them”. It is a kind of social anxiety that pressurises people to stay connected with what their peers are doing. The ‘likes’ and ‘comments’ on social media platforms trigger dopamine and serotonin, often called mood stabilisers or happy hormones. Eventually, this increases the urge to participate in such challenges. Psychologists mention that the same emotions that motivate people to be a part of a charitable viral challenges can attract them to participate in extremely dangerous viral challenges.Teenagers are more susceptible to participating in these challenges as their decision-making capacity is still in the developing stage. A study states that 39% of teenagers post content on social media because of peer pressure to gain more likes and comments and become popular. They urge to get validation from their peers and get accepted by the cool and popular group.For instance, according to Jennifer Hettema, a clinical psychologist,Social media can project a feeling of community and connection, and viral challenges can gain momentum very quickly as a result.Completing the trending challenges may feel like a badge of honour for a person whose family or friends do not appreciate them or value them in their personal life. In other words, participating in such challenges becomes a way to make a place for themselves in the social circles.The trend of participating in challenges began after 2012. Among the most popular challenges, the #IceBucketChallenge gained a lot of popularity. This challenge helped raise awareness for ALS. Hence, it was for a noble cause. After this, many challenges have kept coming with no positive consequences whatsoever, and the trend continues.  Challenges these days rather bring disastrous consequences. Therefore, here are a few precautions that are necessary to avoid falling into trouble:Know the difference between dangerous and entertaining challenges.Talk to your kids about trends and challenges frequently. Parents should know the platforms their kids are using and the content they are watching.If someone is showing signs that are concerning, do not hesitate to seek help from a professional.Featured Image Credits: Abstract vector created by vectorjuice – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Personhood of autonomous systems: Perceived autonomy in computer science",
    "data": "This is the third article in our series on the personhood of autonomous systems. In the first article, we explored the concept of autonomy from legal, philosophical, and technological points of view. We followed this discussion by talking about Kant’s concept of autonomy in the second article. Here, we will make an attempt to understand how autonomy is perceived in the computer science domain.You will often see individuals correlating autonomy with automation. However, both of these mechanisms can be performed separately without human interference. Automation functions without any human intervention, but it is devoid of taking decisions on its own. It will substitute daily actions with software and automated programmes that will require regular checks by human beings out of necessity. On the other hand, autonomy in computer systems intends to follow and match the psychological actions of human beings. The following three factors will characterise autonomy in computer systems:Recurrence of communication with human beings required by the machines to perform actions efficiently.Competence of machines to perform actions, regardless of natural concerns and human intelligence factors.Decisive levels of machines concerning functional decisions for achieving a goal.Some researchers believe that autonomy in computer science is delegated. With ten levels of autonomy, the difficulty in implementing autonomy increases with the increasing number of levels.At level 0, an autonomous device is merely automated.From level two to four, the allotment of decision-making competency between machines and humans becomes prominent.At level 9, a machine receives the fundamental decision-making powers, with humans having special reserved powers.At last, at level 10, a machine becomes completely autonomous.Autonomous systems are capable of amassing various types of information. This includes techniques to achieve their goals or getting familiar with a dynamic environment without human intervention. In the computer science domain, the theory of autonomy is analogous to the human’s nervous system. Our nervous system manages a wide range of body functions with negligible inputs from us. It is capable of arrangement, development, restoration, and protection on its own. The idea behind autonomous systems is to make them competent to control themselves for performing higher goals than system administrators. Autonomy is often an encouraging advancement to reduce human efforts and capital requirements.Sooner or later, autonomous systems will become a part of our surroundings. They will accustom themselves to changes in the environment and perform spontaneous actions for accomplishing their tasks. While there have been multiple attempts to evaluate and determine the level of autonomy in AI devices, prospective researchers can still explore this area. One can construe autonomous systems as task-oriented and spontaneous with no supervision by any external agent. Such systems also come with the capability to interact and react based on their previous experiences.The legal liability of individuals is not based on strong philosophical grounds such as intent or free will. Certain technical restrains bar the lawmakers from parting away with the traditional concept of what liability consists of. It is imperative to note the distinction between the legal liabilities of individuals and autonomous systems. One practical justification is the non-traceability of such actions to human beings. As such, the liability of individuals becomes irrelevant in the context of autonomous systems. In traditional jurisprudence, there is a necessity of humans behind the veil of legal persons. When it comes down to autonomous systems, we will need real characters. No legal deception here can aid the quest for justice.At present, the parallels between autonomous systems and legal personality are far from ideal. We need to answer if these autonomous devices can be regarded as authentic operators in the eyes of traditional psychological concepts? Here is an illustration that can help understand the problem.Consider that there is a co-worker in your office. Their name is X. They come across as a knowledgeable and fun-loving person. They are decent in interaction with people and maintain their composure in difficult situations. Later, you come to know that X is nothing but an autonomous system. The creators have designed it so well that it can encounter all types of communications and provide subsequent responses. The level of sophistication is such that it would never display superiority in front of human beings.After knowing this fact, will you treat X in the same manner as before? The most likely answer is no. For most of us, X will stop being a legal or moral agent. In other words, it will just be an autonomous system working efficiently with the help of well-defined algorithms.This illustration of X calls out for a discussion certainly. Humans tend to attribute intentions to inorganic things. However, we are less likely to perceive objects systematically. As children grow old, their instincts of considering machines as alive objects slow down. This further substantiates that autonomous systems may fulfil the requirements of autonomy as perceived in computer science, but they cannot fulfil the requirements of autonomy as promulgated by Kant yet.Featured Image Credits: Image by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay"

    "headline": "Cyber Security for Lawyers: Inspirations from Australia",
    "data": "This is the third article in our series on Cyber Security for Lawyers. The idea behind this series is to initiate a discussion on why cyber security is essential for lawyers. In the first article, we talked about best practices from the UK based on a guidance document published by the UK’s General Council of the Bar. While in the second article, we deliberated on the guidelines prepared by Canada Bar Association’s Ethics and Professional Responsibility Committee. In this article, we talk about best practices from the Australian legal community.In November 2016, the Law Institute of Victoria formulated and published a cyber security toolkit. The Intellectual Property and Information Technology Committee and the Technology and Law Committee prepared this toolkit for providing guidance and educating staff members on cyber security risks. This toolkit comprises six components:Manager Handout: This handout gives managers a comprehensive overview of the most important cyber security problems they need to discuss.Employee Handout: This handout offers a short summary of the details available in the Manager Handout. Employees must go through this handout for a better discussion on cyber security at their workplace. Also, it provides a dictionary of common terminology related to cyber security.Crucial Cyber Safety Tips: This can be used as a handout during a training session. The organisation should distribute it to employees so that they have access to key cyber safety tips.Cyber Security Case Studies: Trainers can use these case studies to highlight cyber security risks that may come into play due to employees’ conduct.Training Outcomes Checklist: Trainers and organisations can use this checklist to confirm and strike off issues they have dealt with in a training session.Training Engagement: This resource pool consists of cyber security materials to be used by employers to train their employees.According to a recent report by the Australian Cyber Security Centre, they received 67,500 reports of cyber crime in the last year. This is an increment of 13% from their last annual report. Cyber security is not solely an IT issue, and everyone in a law firm has a role to play. The Australian Government’s initiative StaySmartOnline is a good place to begin reviewing basic cyber security measures for your organisation. Common security threats that a law firm may face are:Phishing scams: Phishing scams are notoriously famous, and you may come across such emails regularly. A phishing email usually contains an email leading to a malicious site or an attachment designed to trigger malicious programmes on your computer. Scammers may use social engineering techniques to gather information about your employees and customise emails to increase their chances of success.Ransomware: Think of a business that will store sensitive information in one place. Law firms are certainly one of them. Ransomware encrypts information on your system. As a result, users cannot access their systems like they would normally do. Further, the attacker asks you to pay a ransom to get access to decryption keys. They usually demand ransom in cryptocurrency. You may come across a timer along with a message saying that the ransom amount will increase if you do not pay in the specified duration.Hacking email accounts: Email is the go-to medium for law firms to communicate internally and with their clients. Due to the nature of information being exchanged, attackers know the stakes involved. Make sure your employees have enabled two-factor authentication along with strong passwords. The training program must equip your employees with the necessary knowledge to identify a genuine site and a fake login page.Passwords\n\nAdopt a strong password/passphrase, which is difficult to guess or crack.\nAvoid reusing the same password for multiple accounts. In addition, you can consider using a password manager.\nEnable two-factor authentication wherever possible.\n\nAdopt a strong password/passphrase, which is difficult to guess or crack.Avoid reusing the same password for multiple accounts.

Toolkits like this are a welcome step as they push for implementing good practices. How effectively it will be implemented or adopted is a concern that is often left unaddressed. While adopting this toolkit may not be mandatory, incorporating good security practices will never be a wrong choice for a law firm. Above all, clients place their trust while sharing confidential information with their lawyers and lawyers are expected to maintain confidentiality.Akshara P. Kamath, an undergraduate student at Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad, worked on this article’s initial draft during her internship with The Cyber Blog India in June/July 2020.With inputs from Neha Bhandari.Featured Image Credits: Job vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Search, Advertise, Control: Google’s Overwhelmingly Dominating Position",
    "data": "The competition among individuals and companies is an integral part of the market’s churning in the internet space. However, if such competition turns dystopian, it may disturb the working of the market severely. Therefore, it becomes essential to differentiate between what is competitive and what is anti-competitive. Being competitive is equivalent to being the best, providing the best quality at the most inexpensive rates, and so on – to attract the most customers. Being anti-competitive is leveraging your market power to eliminate prospective competitors so that you do not have to work as hard to be the best. The cornerstone of competition law and anti-trust committees is to ensure that no one or more than one party introduces market barriers for newer and better products/technology to enter. A Department of Justice lawsuit claims that Google has robbed Android device consumers of robust competition on the Play Store.Other claims contend that Google chose a succession of mandatory one-sided contracts and unfair practices to achieve such a dominant position. This has created hurdles for other plays to enter the market and advertise their products or services. However, a common thread in all three complaints that I will be discussing is the allegation against Google. It is alleged that Google has engaged in anti-competitive behaviour to maintain its near-monopolistic position rather than winning on the merits.The US Department of Justice has sued Google for allegedly monopolising the internet search and ad markets. This is one of the most high profile anti-trust cases in the US today. The charges do not mention Google’s targeted advertising business, but they highlight its involvement in search and advertising via its search engine. In terms of anti-trust lawsuits in the US, this is the second-largest case ever. The first case occurred in 2001, wherein the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed an anti-trust suit which they eventually negotiated. FTC, in another case, filed a case against Google in 2013 for introducing a change in their AdSense policy. Eventually, Google paid a massive fine and modified its AdSense policy. Similar cases have been filed in the European Union wherein Google has been issued fines of up to €4.3 billion for anti-competitive practices.In the latest 2020 report, the US government anti-trust panel has claimed that Google formed a wide-ranging monopoly favouring its services and demoting rivals. The House Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust released its findings on Big Tech’s competitive behaviour. It found that the company has maintained its market dominance over multiple markets. Moreover, this dominance ranges from search to advertising to maps by preferring Google’s own services and demoting third parties. This study warned of possible unfair behaviour in its burgeoning cloud business and its possible Fitbit purchase. The Subcommittee has found that Google is by far the most prominent provider of general internet search. It accounts for 81% of all search queries on desktop and 94% on mobile phones. The preliminary investigation has resulted in three cases.The first complaint filed in October 2020 is the smallest of the three. It contends that Google has used anti-competitive practices to safeguard its general search monopoly and prevent other search engines from gaining a foothold. This case, in particular, details Google’s efforts to ensure that it is the default search engine on browsers and devices. For example, Google has paid Apple up to $12 billion per year for making Google Search the default on Safari and iPhones. According to the lawsuit, Google has a firm grip on the search industry. It will keep on generating more search advertising revenue and paying out. The Department of Justice claims that this is an illegal plot to keep Google’s search monopoly.More than thirty states have filed the second and third complaints about Google search. The second complaint claims that Google has exploited its monopoly over the general search, commonly referred to as Googling. Google has discriminated against competitors in the vertical search market, such as Yelp and Kayak. Google’s goal is to start all of the queries on their platform instead of going to a vertical search website or app. Vertical companies are in a challenging position because if consumers cannot discover them quickly through Google, they may not find them at all. States have claimed that this is illegal since the goal and impact are to retain Google’s market share rather than leading consumers to the best results.The focus of the third case is on Google’s stranglehold over digital advertising. According to multiple assessments, Google owns or controls more than 90% of the digital advertising supply chain. If you see an advertisement on a website or app, the publisher has likely used Google to acquire such placement. Moreover, such publishers use Google to make the ad space available and sell them through an automated auction. With one party representing both the buyer and the vendor while at the same time controlling the marketplace, it leads to an apparent conflict of interest. As per the states’ case, Google uses its advertising pipeline control to impose unfair terms on advertisers and publishers. This leads to discrimination against competitive ad tech firms. It further prevents them from deriving more benefits due to more intermediaries in the market.Moreover, in exchange for preferential treatment in Google-run ad auctions, Google has made a pact with Facebook to ease competing with its ad business. If that is the case, such a pact will violate Section 1 of the Sherman Act, which prohibits such partnerships between businesses.While Google faces a possibility of future breakups, it may take a few years before we see any substantial settlement. Even if the new lawsuits make their way through the courts, there is no assurance that the judge will grant something so harsh, even if they rule in favour of the government. It is also possible that the courts can combine multiple claims against the company. In the Department of Justice claim, the bipartisan coalition is already hinting that it will file a motion.New legislation can make the courts more sympathetic to the governments when such situations are on the horizon, but they are not a threat right now. This is probably why Google’s stock price has not reacted to the new litigation. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, has seen its stock grow by 30% in 2020 alone. Investors have grown accustomed to the company’s scrutiny, and they have factored in the risk already. While these cases continue, Google will be scrutinised for every move and acquisition it makes. Many think that the DoJ’s cases against Microsoft in the 1990s and early 2000s deflected attention away from Google.Google will need to devote a significant number of time and resources to defend these large suits. This will be similar to what Microsoft did more than two decades ago, which distracted its management enough to allow internet upstarts like Google to flourish. Regardless of who prevails in the court, repeating the same dynamic could drastically change the tech industry. Even though these cases are a first of their type, swift action is unlikely. However, there can be a spiralling effect. Each country would need to investigate by itself, if Google was involved in an anti-competitive practice. Regulators will undoubtedly be interested in investigating Google’s actions.Will Google, however, be responsible for the same problems all across the world? This remains to be seen.Featured Image Credits: People vector created by pch.vector – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Can a drone violate your privacy by trespassing?",
    "data": "My neighbours had a small and intimate wedding at their home during the second lockdown. They invited all of us to participate from our balconies and terrace. While I was watching the celebration, I heard a constant, loud enough, buzzing sound. I looked up in the sky and found a drone hovering over my terrace. It was apparently trying to capture an aerial shot of the wedding. This got me thinking. Was I a part of the frame? Absolutely yes. Did I want to be a part of the frame in my oldest pair of loungewear? NO. So, could this fall under trespass?A drone is a type of aircraft, alternatively known as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV). It works without a human pilot, and it does not have a crew or passengers. It works in different ways, like through a human-operated remote control or with autopilot assistance without any human interference. One can classify drones based on their weight, autonomy level, altitude, etc.Trespass is a type of tort defined as an inexcusable physical interference on a person’s land by someone, eventually leading to infringement of that person’s rights. Section 441 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, talks about criminal trespass.Cuius est solum, eius est usque ad coelum et ad inferos.This is a common principle of property law. It states that a property owner has a right to everything above and below his property and the land. Traditional trespassing will involve a trespasser physically entering your property without authorisation. However, can a drone hovering a few feet above your property without your authorisation be considered an act of trespassing? As per my understanding, this should depend on the intent and circumstances, which is a tedious task.Drones have become increasingly popular in the last few years. I am sure you know someone who owns a drone or two today, and if not, you would have certainly seen a drone flying. In June 2020, companies like Zomato, Swiggy, and Dunzo received approval from the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) to test their delivery services via drones. It seems that drones will soon become a common household device in the future.DGCA is the regulatory authority for Indian civilian airspace. It released regulations concerning the operation of remotely piloted aircraft (read drones) for the first time in 2018. Earlier this year, on March 12, 2021, the Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV) Rules, 2021, came into effect. After heavy criticism, the government has attempted to liberalise these rules in the Drone Rules, 2021. These rules came into force on August 25, 2021. Before this, the government had published a draft for public consultation.The new rules have come as a relief for many since they have slacked various requirements. For example, the older rules required filling 25 forms, and now, you only need to fill up 5 forms. The fee for operating drones has also been reduced significantly. We have discussed the new drone rules in detail here. Rules related to drones started gaining traction after a drone attack on Indian Air Force’s base in Jammu. Alongside these rules, a single platform called Digital Sky has been set up. This platform provides a visualisation of an airspace map that helps in the identification of green zone (permissible), yellow zone (intermediate), and red zone (no-fly). All said and done, these rules do not address privacy issues surrounding various applications of drones.Drones come fitted with a camera, and some drones are even capable of recording audio. What happens if a drone captures you in your home performing an act you do not expect anyone to see? The new rules are lacking at this point as the Drone Rules, 2021, do not discuss spatial privacy. Violation of privacy due to drones may become a common phenomenon in the second most populated country with a considerably higher population density. At present, we need a regulatory framework that talks about intentional entry into another person’s airspace without their authorisation (i.e., trespassing) and capturing pictures, video, or audio of a person engaging in a private or personal act.A California bill on the invasion of privacy by entering into airspace can act as a good inspiration. This bill places the liability of a drone operator if they attempt to capture an image, video, or audio of an individual engaged in a private or familial act using any device. Such an act will constitute trespass even if it is not physical trespass. The lawmakers must strike a balance between the rights of a landowner and a drone operator. For example, the US tort law defines a limit of a minimum of 50 feet of distance for a flight to maintain over another person’s property.However, determining a distance limit for drones is not an easy task. Factors like, continuous hovering over a person’s private property, flying over a different route despite having another route, flying too close to a property than required, etc., can help determine the intention and liability in the tort of trespass. A court’s main task in determining trespass, will be the test of intention.The debate of private airspace, public airspace, and intention is never-ending. Howsoever, a specific provision relating to spatial privacy will help loosen some knots. Regulatory authorities like DGCA must consider privacy an important aspect as it is a fundamental right under Article 21. While we are yet to have a full-fledged data protection law, a well laid-out regulation is the need of the hour. Drone imposes tangible threats to privacy, and the regulatory authorities must seek to address the shortcomings of the existing regime. Till then, stay safe from the hovering birds and stay tuned!Featured Image Credits: Technology photo created by wirestock – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Operation Blackface and Crawler: Maharashtra Cyber’s drive against CSAM",
    "data": "Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) includes pictures and videos that depict a child engaged in a sexually explicit activity. India sits right above the list based on the global compilation of child sexual abuse material found online. According to the National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC), India reported 1.98 million suspected CSAM reports out of 16.9 million reports globally. These statistics are often used to reflect on the high consumption rate of CSAM in India. Against this common understanding, we have previously published a contradictory opinion here.Irrespective of the numbers, child sexual abuse material is a serious and disturbing problem. When we look at Indian laws, Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 prohibits the transmission and publication of such content. Further, there are multiple provisions in the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (“POCSO”) that can be useful. To efficiently investigate cases involving CSAM, law enforcement agencies will require all the help they can have. This is where Operation Blackface and Crawler come into the picture.Operation Blackface is a Maharashtra Cyber initiative to take action against child sexual abuse material available on the internet. They have a dedicated team called Tactical Response Against Cyber Child Exploitation (TRACE). Maharashtra Cyber has also acquired a state-of-the-art software called Crawler from Interpol. This software will help the TRACE team in tracking cases and crack down the perpetrators. The TRACE team consists of 12 police officers who received their training from the South Asian wing of Interpol.Under this operation, Maharashtra Cyber has conducted online training programmes for 270 officers across the state. These programs have focussed on the amended POCSO Act and handling of CSAM cases. They have also trained police officers in dealing with online racketeers. These racketeers blackmail individuals claiming they have access to search history wherein they have searched about child pornography. Subsequently, these blackmailers ask the victim to pay the ransom in Bitcoins or through other Dark Net channels.As of July 2021, Maharashtra Cyber registered 151 cases under Operation Blackface and charged individuals for almost 213 offences under the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the POCSO Act, 2012. This had led to 105 arrests.Previously, India’s National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB) and NCMEC have signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) for accessing tipline reports on missing and exploited children. NCRB passes the information to respective states as they receive tipline reports from NCMEC. It has appointed a nodal officer in every state responsible for inspecting and scrutinising incidents related to CSAM. Once NCRB receives a tipline report from NCMEC, it is forwarded to the concerned nodal officer for necessary action.In India, Maharashtra Cyber has become the first agency to acquire this software from Interpol. This software detects nudity in images and videos, and it identifies the age of individuals based on their facial structure. Crawler also has in-built algorithms that search for keywords around child pornography to help the police track platforms involved in the proliferation and distribution of CSAM. Once the tool suspects that a piece of content may be CSAM, it is added to the database, after which an officer has to manually verify whether it would fall under child pornography.Children are more vulnerable to exploitation, harassment, and abuse as compared to adults. With the onset of COVID-19 pandemic, the number of cases appears to have increased due to increased screen time. It is necessary to understand that it is illegal to collect, watch, or even search for CSAM. If you encounter any incident or content depicting sexual abuse against a child, you are responsible for mandatorily reporting such an incident as per Section 19(1) of POCSO. In case you fail to report, Section 21 considers the failure to report a punishable offence. You can report such content on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at https://cybercrime.gov.in. A step-by-step guide for filing a complaint on this portal is available here.Featured Image Credits: Kids vector created by pikisuperstar – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Depreciation Rate for Computer and Related Devices",
    "data": "Benjamin Franklin has rightly said – Nothing is certain except death and taxes. While no one can run away from taxes, one can always try to decrease the total tax liability. Depreciation rate allowance is one of the ways to reduce taxable income. In this article, I will be discussing the prescribed depreciation rates on computers and various devices related to a computer system.An asset refers to something of value or of use to the assessee. For example, computers, printers, scanners, software, etc. It reflects on the assets side of the balance sheet. Generally, there are two types of assets: fixed assets and current assets. The value of fixed assets depreciates over time due to the introduction of new technologies and alternatives. Accounting Standard 6 (AS-6) provides for the treatment of depreciation in the books of accounts. There are two methods to calculate depreciation:Straight-line method: In this method, depreciation is calculated every year on the purchasing value of the asset registered in the books of accounts.Written-down value method: In this method, depreciation is calculated every year on the balance value of the asset after deducting depreciation.Depreciation is a non-monetary expense. The tax authorities allow the deduction of depreciation from the income arising from the business or profession, as per Section 32 of the Act. In India, the Income Tax Act, 1961 uses the written-down value method to calculate depreciation. The Income Tax Rules, 1962 divides all assets into various blocks. Rule 5 provides for the manner of calculating depreciation. Prescribed depreciation is allowed on the usage of a fixed asset for 180 days or more in the relevant financial year. Otherwise, an assessee can only claim half of the depreciation allowed.The 1962 Rules, have a table in its appendix that divides assets into two parts: tangible assets and intangible assets. Computers (including software) are a part of the Machinery and Plant block under the tangible assets. Note 7 to this Rule further clarifies that software recorded of any disc, tape, perforated media, or other information device falls within the meaning of computer software.Computer hardware, software, routers, bridges, and data acquisition systems are under the sub-head of Electric Equipment. All these components attract a depreciation rate of 40%. Earlier, the rate of depreciation for computer and computer software was 60%. With effect from the accounting year 2017-18, the rate of depreciation is now 40%.The Income Tax Act, 1961 does not define computer, which leaves the scope of litigation open. At present, the tribunal and courts have decided many cases where questions related to the scope of the word “computer” are asked. I have grouped such cases under the following heads for a better understanding.The Income Tax Appellate Tribunal in Kohinoor India Private Limited v. ACIT did not consider iPads as a computer. In this case, the Assessing Officer contended that the iPad is more similar to iPhone than any computer system. They have similar features, operating systems and functioning. But, the assessee argued that it is not practical to use an iPad as a phone due to its size and weight. The Appellate Tribunal opined that the iPad is utilised mostly for communication purposes, and it can never substitute computers. The Bench in Federal Bank Ltd. v. ACIT ((2011) 332 ITR 319) and Niho Construction Ltd v. DCIT (ITA 3063/Del/2011) had the same opinion. Mobile phones and iPads depreciated at the rate of 15%, like any other plant and machinery.Earlier, courts did not consider UPS as an integral part of the computer system. In TelCordia Technologies Private Ltd v. ACIT (2012), the court held that UPS is a device only to regulate the power supply during emergency times. It is more like an external help for the computer system. But, the recent precedents have shown the change in this view. In Religare Securities Ltd v. DCIT (2020), the Delhi Bench of the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal accepted the assessee’s claim to depreciate UPS at the rate of 60%. The Bench considered UPS as an essential component of any computer system. A similar opinion has been observed in CIT v. Orient Ceramics & Industries Ltd (ITA 65/2011), Ray Ban Sun Optics India Ltd v. DCIT (5933/Del/2012) and Commissioner of Income Tax v. OCHOA Laboratories Ltd (2017).In DCIT v. Datacraft India Ltd (2010), the Appellate Tribunal discussed whether routers and switches can be considered under the definition of computer. In this case, the assessee was into the business of data communication and selling networking products. The assessee argued that the router is a significant part of the computer system. It enables the transmission of information between different networks. It also ensures that the information reaches the specified destination. Routers and switches can function only with a computer. Hearing the arguments and relying on the definition of computer given in Section 2(1)(i) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, the tribunal decided in the assessee’s favour.In M/s Pentamedia Graphics Ltd v. DCIT (2020), the assessee hired programmers to develop software for making animated movies. The making of such movies involved extensive processes such as adding visual effects, making characters, etc. For these activities, software was developed and stored on an information storage device. The assessee claimed a depreciation rate of 60%. The tribunal did not accept this claim and only allowed depreciation at the rate of 25%. It considered the assessee’s software as copyrighted material under the head of intangible assets.In Royal Bank of Scotland v. DCIT (2016), the assessee claimed the depreciation rate of 60% on ATMs. ATM machines and computers use almost the same software. It is capable of performing logical, arithmetic and memory functions. The Bench considered the definition of the computer given in Section 2(1)(i) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the judgement of DCIT v. Datacraft India Ltd (2010). Subsequently, the Appellate Tribunal allowed the depreciation rate of 60%.In M/s Crabtree India Ltd. v. Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (2010), the assessee claimed the depreciation of 60% on all the video conferencing equipment. The Income Tax Appellate tribunal relied on Explanation A to Section 36(1)(xi) of the Act and the study materials of ICAI to conclude that each item has to be analysed in detail by the assessing officer to decide whether the device is a computer or not.LAN enables connected computer systems to communicate with each other. Two or more LANs make a WAN. In Oriental Bank of Commerce v. ACIT (2013), the tribunal affirmed the action of the assessee to depreciate the LAN and WAN equipment at the rate of 60%. The court relied on the definition of computer and computer network given in Section 2(1)(i) and 2(1)(j) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, respectively. In CIT v. BSES Rajdhani Power Ltd (ITA 1266/2010), the Delhi High Court held that computer peripherals are part of the computer system. The Appellate Tribunal had the same observation in the case of Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax v. Global Trust Bank Ltd (2011).In Tata Communications Ltd. v. Addl. CIT (2014), the assessing officer had imposed a penalty on the assessee for charging a higher depreciation rate on GDS. The Commissioner of Income Tax (CIT) reversed the orders, and the Appellate Tribunal agreed with the CIT’s order.In CIT v. Kumudam Publications Pvt Ltd (2019), the assessee claimed the depreciation rate of 60% on LED panels. The Appellate Tribunal decided that the LED panel in question is a computer as it has processing ability and it can perform memory and logical functions. The Appellate Tribunal ruled in the assessee’s favour.In Income Tax Officer v. Vaidangi Techno Management Consultants Pvt Ltd (2017), the Appellate Tribunal held that a UID kit can be considered in the definition of computer. The assessee contended that devices such as fingerprint scanners, IRIS scanners, and webcams play a crucial role in making and modifying Aadhaar cards. Without these cards, it is not possible to add a new entry or modify an existing entry. The Tribunal accepted this submission and ruled in the assessee’s favour.The higher the depreciation rate, the lower will be tax liability and taxable income. From an assessee’s point of view, one would try to include every possible device in the definition of a computer. As we move towards everything digital, depreciation allowance may encourage the transition from traditional to digital modes of doing business. While the government is pushing for Digital India, allowing a higher depreciation rate looks like a reasonable step.Featured Image Credits: Business photo created by snowing – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Facial Recognition System and Laws in China",
    "data": "China has taken a giant leap in technology by inventing some of the most sophisticated surveillance systems. From mounting surveillance on the perceived wrong-doing of citizens, the focus of Chinese authorities also includes ethnic minorities such as the Muslim Uighur population. By 2018, China had installed more than 200 million surveillance cameras in the country. The Guardian has reported that, Chinese cities dominate the top 10 cities with most street cameras per person.Facial recognition systems in China have entered into a diverse range of spaces. Some of the examples include:In 2016, China developed an AnBot Police Robot that carries a stun weapon and facial recognition cameras. The purpose behind such robots was to regulate and patrol the Shenzhen Airport.Smart glasses are helping police officers identify and catch criminals. These glasses are wearable computer glasses through which a wearer can see information about the person they are examining. In addition, they have options for changing the optical properties of a device, and they are as good as a facial recognition system.China’s social credit system is another such example. We have discussed this in detail here.Amidst the ongoing pandemic, China’s National AI team has modified facial recognition systems. They have introduced AI-enabled body temperature detection technology for screening travellers. Leading tech companies such as Hikivison, Dahut, and iFlytek has assisted the government in adapting systems for the current situation.The Cybersecurity Law of the People’s Republic of China is a broader data protection framework for regulating facial recognition technology in China. This law prescribes legal obligations regarding the collection, protection, and usage of personally identifiable information.As multiple reports of facial recognition algorithms going wrong started coming up, they have flagged the issues of social biases and illegal use of this technology for surveillance. The use of facial recognition technology has enabled the police to practice their biases against certain communities. Apart from this, there are technical failures as well. For instance, Apple’s Face ID technology could not distinguish between individual Chinese faces. Similarly, an MIT research found that China-based Megyii tools had high error rates in identifying dark-skinned individuals.China’s first lawsuit related to facial recognition technology involves a professor, Guo Bing, from the Zhejiang Sci-Tech University and the Hangzhou Wildlife Park. Bing availed the annual membership card of the park for him and his wife in April 2019. As required, the couple submitted their identity card details, fingerprints, and mugshots. Later in July 2019, the park upgraded its entry system using facial recognition technology. The park management sent messages to Bing for activating facial recognition to enter the park. Bing asked the park to cancel his membership and refund the membership fees, fearing that the park was compromising his privacy. The Intermediate People’s Court in Hangzhou (Zhejiang) ordered the park to delete facial information and fingerprints of Bing within 10 days.China passed the Personal Information Protection Law (PIPL) in 2020 that will come into effect on November 01, 2021. This law aims to put an end to unscrupulous data collection in the cyber space. China’s National Cyberspace Administration (CAC) laid down this law after observing an increased number of cases of government misuse of personal information of individuals. Article 8 of this law talks about data collection requirements. It covers the purpose, quality, method of using and collecting data, information about third parties, etc. Alongside PIPL, the CAC has also brought in the Data Security Law. This law came into effect on September 01, 2021. It sets a framework for companies to classify their data based on its relevance to China’s national security and economic value.Specifically focussing on facial recognition, China’s National Information Security Standardisation Technical Committee published a draft standard for facial recognition data security requirements. This standard lays down requirements for collecting, processing, and transferring facial recognition data. These requirements include:Organisations should only use this technology to identify a person.An organisation should opt for this technology only when an alternative technology is inefficient or has security concerns.Organisations should not use facial recognition to identify children below the age of 14 years.Without obtaining the express consent of an individual, an organisation cannot obtain facial recognition data.Currently, this standard is still a draft, and it was available for public consultation until June 22, 2021. It is currently under review by the National People’s Congress of China.As an increasing number of user concerns surfaced, technology companies made efforts to self-regulate themselves. For example, Megyii is a Chinese company specialising in facial recognition systems. They laid down guidelines to follow while using facial recognition systems. SenseTime, Xiaomi, Tencent, and other tech companies collaborated with the government to draft China’s first industry standards. The idea behind this collaboration was to set up a sustainable and safe environment for facial recognition systems. Above all, this is a welcome step wherein the government works with tech companies to set industry standards.The introduction of new laws and standards shows a regulatory shift in dealing with facial recognition technology. However, the pace of advancement of technology in China should make one curious about the future. At present, it may be early to predict the outcome. An effective way to address public concerns related to facial recognition technology is to increase the involvement of civil society in the policy-making process.Further, the effectiveness of such regulations will also depend on their implementation and adoption by the general public. This subject is extremely relevant and debatable today, while we cannot deny the usefulness of this technology. However, blind and thoughtless implementation can backfire and create chaos among the general public.Featured Image Credits: Technology photo created by rawpixel.com – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "सोशल मीडिया चलाने की न्यूनतम आयु क्या है?",
    "data": "वर्चुअल दुनिया में यह स्पष्ट है कि भारत अब राज्यों द्वारा बाध्य नहीं रहा है। हम अपने जीवन में वर्चुअल रूप से लोगों से अधिक एकजुट और जुड़े रहने का प्रयास करते हैं। सोशल मीडिया वेबसाइटें बच्चों के लिए सबसे अच्छे स्थानों में से एक है और व्यस्त माता-पिता के लिए अपने दोस्तों और परिवार से जुड़ने का माध्यम भी है। लेकिन हम वास्तव में हमारे इस वर्चुअल लाइफ को कहां ले जा रहे हैं? क्या इस भारत देश के बच्चे सही दिशा में आगे बढ़ रहे हैं? क्या वे सुरक्षित हैं? जिस तरीके से सर्फिंग करना चाहिए क्या वे उस तरीके से कर रहे हैं? पहले सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफार्म जैसे ऑरकुट और फेसबुक का इस्तेमाल ज्यादा होता था, अब दुनिया व्हाट्सएप, इंस्टाग्राम, स्नैपचैट, टिकटॉक आदि जैसे प्लेटफॉर्म्स का इस्तेमाल करने लगी है। सोशल नेटवर्किंग ने संचार और जानकारी को शेयर करने के नए तरीकों को प्रोत्साहित किया है।ऑनलाइन होने वाली संचार व्यवस्था दुनिया के फायदे और नुकसान को समझने की बच्चों की क्षमता को कम करती हैं। सोशल नेटवर्किंग व्यक्तिवाद (individualism) शैली का निर्माण कर रहा है, जिसमें समाज और देश के पहले व्यक्ति आता है। व्यक्तिवाद रिश्ते को समझने और स्वीकार करने की आदत को रोकता है। सोशल नेटवर्किंग के अनियंत्रित इस्तेमाल में वृद्धि के साथ, बच्चे ऑनलाइन धोखाधड़ी और आक्रामक मार्केटिंग की चपेट में आ रहे हैं। जैसे शादी करने के लिए एक उम्र है, काम करने के लिए एक उम्र है, वैसे ही सोशल मीडिया चलाने के लिए भी एक उम्र होना चाहिए। क्या आपको भी ऐसा लगता है?एक बच्चे को वेब से परिचित कराने के लिए कौन सी उम्र सही है? दूसरे देशों के लिए यह करीब 13 साल है। भारत में हमारे यहां अलग स्थिति है। भारत का कानूनी ढांचा 18 वर्ष से कम आयु के किसी भी व्यक्ति को सोशल नेटवर्क से जुड़ने की अनुमति नहीं देता है। कुछ कारणों से, फर्जी उम्र की प्रोफाइल बनाकर इन नेटवर्क से जुड़ना बच्चों के लिए बहुत गर्व की बात है। आप अपने आसपास देख सकते हैं और कई ऐसे उदाहरण पाएंगे जहां एक 14 साल का बच्चा पहले से ही फेसबुक पर 25 साल का है।हालाँकि भारत में, फेसबुक द्वारा बताई गई 13 वर्ष की न्यूनतम उम्र भी लागू क्यों नहीं है, यह एक अजीब मुद्दा है। ‘एक बच्चा कौन है?’ इसकी परिभाषाओं की संख्या विविध है, आईपीसी कुछ कहता है, बाल विवाह और निषेध अधिनियम, 1929 कुछ और कहता है। लेकिन हम कानूनी तौर पर देखें तो हमें भारतीय संविदा अधिनियम, 1872 और भारतीय वयस्कता अधिनियम, 1875 को देखना चाहिए, जो स्पष्ट रूप से 18 साल की आयु सीमा स्पष्ट करता है। तो क्या इसका मतलब यह है कि अपने बचपन में जो हमने I Agree और Yes, Please बटन पर क्लिक करा है उसका कोई मतलब नहीं है?कानूनी तौर पर तो यह एक सोचने वाली बात है। इस मुद्दे पर कोई भी मामला सामने नहीं आया है जिससे कि भारतीय कानूनी प्रणाली का रुख इस पर थोड़ा अस्थिर है। यह एक खुला प्रश्न है और चिंता का विषय है जो भारत के कई लोग और दूरदर्शियों ने चर्चा के लिए उठाया है।2013 में दिल्ली उच्च न्यायालय ने केंद्र सरकार से यह पूछा कि वे बताएं कि फेसबुक और गूगल जैसी सोशल नेटवर्किंग साइटों पर वे 18 साल से कम उम्र वाले बच्चों को अकाउंट खोलने की अनुमति कैसे दे रहे थे। जब भाजपा के पूर्व नेता के.एन. गोविंदाचार्य (मामले के याचिकाकर्ता) के वकील ने दों साइटों पर उनके उपयोगकर्ताओं के विवरण को सत्यापन नहीं करने का आरोप लगाया, तब न्यायाधीश बी.डी. अहमद और न्यायाधीश विभू बाखरू की एक खंडपीठ ने 10 दिन के भीतर सरकार से जवाब मांगा। मामले को अग्रिम सुनवाई के लिए पोस्ट कर दिया गया था।न्यायपीठ ने फेसबुक और गूगल को भी याचिका के पक्षकारों के रूप में माना और उन्हें नोटिस जारी किए। उनकी भारतीय सहायक कंपनियों ने याचिका का जवाब दिया था। इससे पहले, याचिकाकर्ता के लिए दलील देने वाले अधिवक्ता विराग गुप्ता, ने कहा कि साइटों के साथ नाबालिगों द्वारा जो करार (agreements) हुए हैं वह भारतीय वयस्कता अधिनियम, 1875, भारतीय संविदा अधिनियम, 1872, और सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी अधिनियम, 2000 के विरुद्ध है। जून 2012 में, फेसबुक ने अमेरिकी प्रतिभूति और विनिमय आयोग (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission) के सामने एक बयान में कहा कि उसके पंजीकृत उपयोगकर्ताओं में से 8 करोड़ से अधिक ने अकाउंट बनाते वक्त झूठी जानकारी दी थी।रिट याचिका (सिविल) 3672/2012 की जून 2012 से अप्रैल 2016 तक की सभी सुनवाई को देखने के बाद समझ आता है कि माननीय न्यायालय ने अपने आदेश दिनांक 23.08.2013 में केवल 13 वर्ष की आयु के बच्चों को अनुमति देने पर चर्चा की है। जहां तक ​​इस आदेश का संबंध है, अदालत ने केवल यह माना कि 13 वर्ष से कम उम्र के बच्चों को सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म पर अकाउंट बनाने की अनुमति नहीं है, इस बात में कोई विवाद नहीं है। ऐसा लगता है कि अदालत ने याचिकाकर्ता की इस दलील पर ध्यान नहीं दिया कि नाबालिगों का सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म के लिए साइन अप करना भारतीय संविदा अधिनियम, 1872 और ऐसे अन्य कानूनों का उल्लंघन है।इसके अलावा, ऐसा प्रतीत होता है कि इस याचिका में मुद्दा यह था कि क्या इंटरमीडियरी 2011 के दिशानिर्देशों का अनुपालन कर रहे हैं या नहीं। अदालत द्वारा इस विषय पर की गई चर्चा को आनुषंगिक उक्ति (obiter dicta) माना जायेगा।साइबर कानून विशेषज्ञों का कहना था कि याचिका में योग्यता हो सकती है, क्योंकि दुर्व्यपदेशन (misrepresentation) दंडात्मक कार्यवाही को आमंत्रित कर सकता है। सूचना प्रौद्योगिकी अधिनियम, 2000 के तहत एक फर्जी/मिथ्या इलेक्ट्रॉनिक रिकॉर्ड बनाना अपराध है और भारतीय दंड संहिता, 1860 की धारा 465 के तहत यह अपराध 2 साल तक के कारावास को आमंत्रित करता है और अगर धोखे के उद्देश्य से खोले गए अकाउंट का इस्तेमाल होता है तो यह 7 साल तक के कारावास के साथ दंडनीय होगा। आईपीसी और आईटी एक्ट के तहत उन बच्चों पर कानूनी कार्रवाई हो सकती है जो इन वेबसाइटों पर अकाउंट खोलने के लिए अपनी उम्र के बारे में खुले तौर पर झूठ बोलते हैं और उन माता-पिता पर भी जो अपने नाम पर अकाउंट खोलने के दौरान जानते हुए भी अपने बच्चों की गलत जानकारी देते हैं। कानून की अनदेखी कोई बहाना नहीं है।कुछ साल पहले हुए कुख्यात यूरोपीय परिषद समझौते पर ध्यान नहीं दिया जाए, ऐसा हो ही नहीं सकता।  लंदन में, गूगल, फेसबुक, याहू और माइक्रोसॉफ्ट सहित कुछ 17 वेब फर्मों ने सोशल नेटवर्किंग साइट्स का उपयोग करते समय बच्चों को होने वाले नुकसान से बचाने के लिए पहले यूरोपीय समझौते पर हस्ताक्षर किया था। वे प्रमुख खतरे जो उन्होंने यूरोप में पाए थे उनसे निपटने के लिए सोशल नेटवर्किंग टास्क फाॅर्स की स्थापना की गई थी। सोशल नेटवर्क वालों ने यह सहमति व्यक्त की कि वे एक सुलभ और आसानी से उपयोग किए जाने वाला “रिपोर्ट अब्यूज” (गलत इस्तेमाल होने पर सूचना देने वाला) बटन प्रदान करेंगे। वो ये भी सुनिश्चित करेंगे कि पूरी ऑनलाइन प्रोफाइलें और वेबसाइट उपयोगकर्ताओं की संपर्क सूची, जो 18 वर्ष से कम है, डिफ़ॉल्ट रूप से प्राइवेट पर सेट रहेगी, और कम उम्र के उपयोगकर्ताओं को उनकी सेवाओं के इस्तेमाल करने से रोकेंगे।अगर यूरोप अपनी व्यवस्था में ऐसे अभिनव कदम ले सकता है, जहां भारत की तुलना में इतने उपयोगकर्ता भी नहीं है, तो क्या भारतीय कानून विभिन्न सोशल मीडिया प्लेटफॉर्म्स पर कानूनी रूप से बच्चों को सहयोग करने के लिए अपने आप को मज़बूत करने की कोशिश नहीं कर सकता है? इस मुद्दे से निपटने के लिए कुछ सुझाव इस प्रकार है:13 वर्ष से अधिक उम्र के बच्चों द्वारा सोशल मीडिया के उपयोग के लिए प्रावधान लाना।समस्या यह है कि बच्चे अपने माता-पिता से झूठ बोलते हैं। उन्हें लगता है कि उनके माता-पिता उन्हें सोशल नेटवर्क का उपयोग करने से रोकेंगे या उनका इंटरनेट बंद कर देंगे। माता-पिता और बच्चों को आपस में जोड़ने के लिए संभावित तरीकों का अन्वेषण किया जाना चाहिए।सुधारों के लिए भारतीय सरकार को सोशल नेटवर्कों से समझौता करना चाहिए।एक पैनिक बटन, 18 वर्ष से कम उम्र के उपयोगकर्ताओं को सर्च के दायरें से बहार करना, और सामग्री सीमा को परिभाषित करना चाहिए।बच्चों को कानून के बारे में बताया जाए ताकि वे उनके द्वारा किये जाने वाले हरकतों से डर सके।इस लेख को अंग्रेज़ी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। | To read this article in English, click here.Featured mage Credits: Technology vector created by pch.vector – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Android Power and Abuse of Dominance: Google and Self-preferencing",
    "data": "Today, cyber space has become competitive, open, and transparent like never before. In the last three years, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) has investigated the working of an American tech giant, who many believe to be synonymous with the internet itself. As of September 2021, CCI has found that Alphabet Inc. in general, or Google LLC specifically, adopted anti-competitive, unfair, and restrictive trade practices in the mobile operating system.CCI’s first report came in 2019. Since then, the COVID-19 pandemic has doubled internet usage. As a result, tough questions are being asked against Google’s ubiquitous approach towards Android OS. This article looks at the 2019 report and the most recent finding that Google misused its dominant position through self-preferencing.Through an order dated November 09, 2020, CCI, in its prima facie order, found that Google has misused its dominance in the market. Subsequently, the Commission ordered a detailed investigation in this matter. The question arises from Google’s recent policy change requiring all Google Play Store app owners to pay a 30% fee on all digital products and services sold. While the informant has not highlighted this as a major unfair practice, Google’s requirement of mandatorily using Google Pay for accepting payments is troublesome. The informant has alleged that this requirement violates Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002.The informant further claimed that Google Pay receives preferential treatment and positioning on Google Play Store. As per the 2020 order, the focus is on Google’s favourable treatment of its own affiliates, called self-preferencing. This is the second time that CCI has launched an investigation against Google.Earlier in April 2019, CCI ordered an investigation for allegations concerning the abuse of dominant position. The informants submitted that a majority of smartphone/tablet manufacturers in India use the Android operating system. Android is an open-source operating system, subject to a basic license. However, a large number of manufacturers combine Android with Google’s proprietary applications and services, i.e., Google Mobile Services (GMS). GMS includes a large range of applications such as Google Maps, Google Chrome, and YouTube. Manufacturers load these apps after signing the Mobile Application Distribution Agreement (MADA) and the Anti Fragmentation Agreement (AFA). End-users like us cannot directly access these apps for installation.In the 2019 case, the Commission established a prima facie case of anti-competitive practices by Google. It identified the relevant market as licensable smart mobile OS. The Commission noted that mobile OS differs from desktop OS as they offer an extra feature for handheld use. The Commission has excluded Windows and iOS from the relevant market as third-party developers cannot access them.CCI considered Google a market leader in the relevant industry as it accounts for 80% of India’s mobile OS market. It also relied on a European Commission judgement that deemed Google the market leader in general internet search services and licensable mobile OS. In July 2018, the European Commission had fined Google €4.34 billion (₹135.86 crores) for illegal practices to strengthen the Google search engine’s dominance. This case is also known as the search bias case.It is not surprising that CCI’s 2019 order is a second blow to Google and its services. While the Commission has taken a prima facie stance against the company, it remains to be seen how CCI’s investigative arm will conclude their findings.Self-preferencing refers to the actions of a company to favour its own products and services above those of its rivals. Section 4 of the Competition Act, 2002 does not specifically identify self-preferencing as an anti-competitive practice. However, the CCI had ordered an investigation as self-preferencing led to the abuse of dominant position in the market. The term “self-preferencing” as a single category of anti-competitive behaviour fails to reflect the wide range of manifestations. While it may result in exclusion in some situations (for example, if the dominant company is essential to its competitors’ operations), it can also foster synergies and improve customer welfare.At present, whether self-preferencing is anti-competitive is done on a case-by-case basis, considering the final implication of the act. When writing this article, Google has approached the Delhi High Court against CCI to prevent any further illegal disclosure of confidential conclusions. The company has approached the High Court after the investigation findings have been leaked. These 750-page findings conclude that mandatory pre-installation of applications amounts to imposing unfair conditions on the device makers. This report categorically explains and elaborates on how Google misused its position to maintain dominance in the market.If the news reports are true, Google appears to have abused its dominant position in multiple relevant markets. For instance, these relevant markets can include internet search services and licensable mobile device OS. Google has often implemented one-sided, ambiguous, vague, biased, and arbitrary policies. Considering the extent of Google’s dominance, unconscionable contracts have come out as bundling agreements. The most probable outcome of this case is going to be a hefty penalty. Moreover, the Commission will also require Google to discontinue anti-competitive practices.Featured Image Credits: Technology vector created by rawpixel.com – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Facebook and Broken Promises of Data Protection",
    "data": "Gone are the days when only currency and jewels were considered valuable assets. The 21st century is witnessing growth in the value of data. But are we concerned about the protection of our data? The deliberate answer may be ‘yes’ but technology has spun such a thick web around us that absolute data protection is a distant dream. The presence of social media platforms has made this task even tougher. It will be wrong to attribute the failure to only the end-users. Over the years, we have seen that even platforms like Facebook have miserably failed to protect users’ personal data.The concerns of data protection and privacy have been associated with Facebook since its inception. Mark Zuckerberg, faced allegations of stealing the idea for developing the platform from Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss and hacking the email accounts of two private users. Presently, Facebook claims to invest all possible efforts to protect its users’ personal data and privacy and provide a secure environment on its platform. However, past instances paint a very dull picture. In this article, we take a look at incidents where Facebook failed to protect the personal data of its users.In 2008, Facebook was alleged of publishing analysis of user behaviour without obtaining their consent. Facebook also faced allegations for violating anti-hacking and wiretap laws in 2008.The voting power of the people is one of the prominent characteristics of a democracy. The more unbiased voters, the more successful a democracy is. The problem arises when voters get manipulated by misinformation or specific advertising. It influences their voting patterns and impacts the final outcome. This has already happened in US Presidential Election and Brexit Plebiscite in 2016.Cambridge Analytica is a political consulting and strategic communication firm. Through a personality quiz application called thisisyourdigitallife, they had access to personal data of 87 million Facebook users. The information available with Cambridge Analytica included religious beliefs, political choices, sexual orientation, etc. Five years before this incident, reports in 2011 disclosed how third parties could access personal data of Facebook users.This incident had spurred a political roar in India as well. In 2018, Christopher Wylie, the whistleblower of the Cambridge Analytica incident, had accused the Indian National Congress in the UK’s House of Commons. He stated that they took assistance from the firm in their election campaign. However, an inquiry on this issue has not provided any convincing evidence. In January 2021, CBI filed an FIR against the firm for accessing personal data of Indian users without their consent. Whether the firm will be liable for its actions is something that we will see in the near future. Meanwhile, the #deletefacebook movement emerged on social media as a response to the Cambridge Analytica incident. Under this campaign, users delete their Facebook account and use this hashtag to share the update through other platforms like Twitter.To read more about the Cambridge Analytica incident, you can check this article.In April 2021, a user published personal information of about 533 million Facebook users on a low-level hacking website. This information included full names, phone numbers, emails, addresses, Facebook IDs, birth dates, etc. This data was available for a while, and Facebook never gave a substantive clarification. Before this incident, 419 million records of users’ phone numbers were leaked along with their Facebook IDs in 2019.In April 2019, a Business Insider report revealed that Facebook had harvested email contacts of 1.5 million users without their consent. They found that Facebook was asking for email passwords when new users were signing up on the platform. If a user entered their email password, a message popped up which read as importing your contacts. For this, Facebook did not ask for any permission or explicit consent.Six4Three filed a case against Facebook in 2015 after Facebook restricted their app, called Pikinis, to access user data. Pikinis was a short-lived app that identified users’ friends’ photos in bikinis. During the case, Facebook had to turn in thousands of pages of internal documents. These documents illustrated how Facebook put in efforts to control its competitors by withholding user data. These documents also revealed that while Facebook publicly justified its decisions as driven by privacy concerns, they were only worried about threats from competitors.It is evident that the platform has not done enough to uphold individuals’ privacy and data protection rights. There are subject matter experts who believe that Facebook has been too busy lobbying against the data privacy laws. On the one hand, Facebook contends that it is almost impossible to maintain privacy on social media. However, this defence is in total contradiction with the commitments they make to their users. Are those commitments merely a publicity stunt? It may be true that maintaining privacy and ensuring absolute protection in present times can be a mirage. However, Facebook cannot use this as an alibi and continue to evade its responsibility until a competent authority imposes a fine for its wrongdoings. One such example is FTC’s record fine of $5 billion after the Cambridge Analytica incident.Featured Image Credits: Background vector created by freepik – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Key Features of the Drone Rules, 2021",
    "data": "On June 27, 2021, small drones were used to drop explosives on the Jammu Air Base. This was the first instance when something like this happened, and the Army started procuring jammers to protect their forward bases. Earlier this year, the Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Rules, 2021, came into effect on March 12, 2021. Now, the Government seeks to liberalise these Rules by exercising their powers given under Sections 5, 10(2), 10A, 10B, and 12A of the Aircraft Act, 1934.A draft of the Drone Rules, 2021 (“Rules”) was published in July 2021 and invited suggestions and objections from the general public. The draft Rules recognises the role drones can play in boosting the country’s economy and generating employment opportunities. However, at the same time, there is a need to regulate drone-related activities so that they do not pose risks to the safety or security of individuals and assets. In this article, we will be looking at key features of the Drone Rules, 2021. This rules have come into effect on August 25, 2021.The Rules classify drones based on their total weight, including the payload they carry.Nano drone: less than or equal to 250 gramsMicro drone: more than 250 grams but less than 2 kilogramsSmall drone: more than 2 kilograms but less than 25 kilogramsMedium drone: more than 25 kilograms but less than 150 kilogramsLarge drone: more than 150 kilogramsDrones are now required to be registered on an online platform called the Digital Sky platform. The Ministry of Civil Aviation has set up this platform to manage drone-related activities. Upon successful registration, this platform should issue a Unique Identity Number (UIN).The Rules authorise the Central Government to create operating zones for various types of zones. These zones will be Red, Yellow, and Green. The Green Zone will be from the ground level to 400 feet (120 metres). The Government has to define and publish the information about these zones on the Digital Sky website within 30 days of the official notification. These zones are going to be dynamic in nature, and the Government may change the specifications.One has to possess a certified remote pilot license issued by an authorised remote pilot training organisation for operating drones. However, Rule 24(6) exempts this requirement for operating a nano drone and using a micro drone for non-commercial purposes. For a remote pilot license to be valid, it must be enlisted on the Digital Sky platform.According to Rule 23, all the state governments, union territory administrations, and law enforcement agencies will have access to data available on the Digital Sky platform.As per Rule 28, the provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 and related rules will apply for third-party insurance of drones. If a drone damages an individual’s property, the drone operator should compensate the victim.The Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) Rules, 2021, required a total of 25 forms for operating drones. However, the new Rules have brought this number down to 5. In a sense, the Government has liberalised drone regulation.The new Rules reflect a change in the Government’s strategy for regulating drones. It is no longer far fetched thought that drones will start making home deliveries. Recently, Swiggy and ANRA Technologies have collaborated for starting trials for food delivery. As various applications of drones emerge, we will see a good number of challenges waiting to be solved. The most prominent challenges are the lack of plane surfaces, obstruction due to power lines, and security concerns.Featured Image Credits: People vector created by pch.vector – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Why is the Government amending the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020?",
    "data": "According to a PIB press release, the Government has received multiple complaints of cheating and unfair trade practice in the e-commerce ecosystem. Such instances have negatively impacted the business sentiment in the market. With an increasing number of e-commerce platforms and a lack of regulatory oversight, unfair trade practices flourish. Some of the identified problems include:Engaging in the manipulation of search results for promoting certain sellers,Giving preferential treatment to some sellers,Marketplace e-commerce entities involved in the indirect operation of sellers on their platform,Affecting the free choice of customers, andSelling goods close to their expiration date.To minimise such instances, the Government has proposed various amendments to the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020. In one of our previous articles, we have discussed the 2020 Rules in detail. In this article, we will be looking at various changes that the Government has proposed.The new amendment introduces the concept of mis-selling. It defines mis-selling as selling goods or services by deliberate misrepresentation of information by an e-commerce entity. A seller gives false information about the product to make it appealing to a prospective buyer. Therefore, Rule 5(11) in the proposed amendment prohibits mis-selling to protect the consumers from cheating and fraudulent purchases of low-quality products.Rule 5(4) states that no e-commerce entity shall allow any display or promotion of misleading advertisements on its platform, whether in the course of business on its platform or otherwise.The amendment will require e-commerce entities to display information about best/use before date. This information should be available in a clear and accessible manner. This will help consumers make informed decisions.This amendment introduces another concept called fallback liability. This concept defines the liability of a marketplace entity if a seller fails to deliver goods or services due to negligence or any other reason that results in a loss to the consumer. This fallback liability provision ensures that consumers are not affected when a seller does not deliver promised goods or services.E-Commerce entities provide their customers with a search feature to find relevant products and services. However, if e-commerce entities manipulate search results to favour particular products or sellers, consumers cannot make free choices about what they would like to buy. Due to this, other sellers on the same platform are also put in a disadvantageous position. If implemented, the new Rules will entirely prohibit the manipulation of search results.The proposed changes introduce the following requirements about consumers’ personal information:Marketplace e-commerce entities should not use information collected through their platform for the unfair advantage of their related parties and associated enterprises.E-commerce entities are responsible for ensuring that consumer information is only available to consumers. They should not disclose consumer information to a third party without the express consent of the consumer.No e-commerce entity should automatically record its consumers’ consent.Rule 3(e) defines a flash sale as a sale organised by an e-commerce entity at significantly lower prices or other attractive offers for a predetermined period on select goods and services to attract the customers. At present, some e-commerce platforms enable preferred sellers only for providing deep discounts. This change aims at removing such flash sales through Rule 5(16) to protect other sellers registered with the concerned e-commerce entity. Preferential treatment to a select group of sellers impacts the opportunities of other sellers on a platform.With the proposed amendment, the Government seeks to prevent an e-commerce entity from abusing its dominant position in any market. This will minimise entry barriers present for upcoming e-commerce platforms.As per Rule 5(7), when an e-commerce entity offers imported goods and services, it should:Identify goods based on their country of origin,Provide a filter mechanism on their e-commerce website,Suggest alternatives to ensure a fair opportunity for domestic goods,Provide ranking for goods, andEnsure that the ranking parameters do not discriminate against domestic goods and sellers.Imported goods often substitute domestic products in the market due to their demand and reputation, which may leave domestic products and sellers in the dark. Therefore, this provision seeks to give domestic manufacturers a fair and equal opportunity to showcase their products.A common criticism of the proposed changes in the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020, is that the Consumer Affairs Department is venturing into areas where the Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (DPIIT) and the Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology (MeitY) are already working. At the same time, one cannot deny that strengthening the regulation of the e-commerce ecosystem is the need of the hour as Indians increasingly become reliant on digital services. The proposed changes also include the appointment of a Chief Compliance Officer to ensure effective compliance with the parent Act and subsequent Rules and establish a strong foundation for grievance redressal mechanism. However, all of these proposed changes will only matter if they are implemented strictly with proper checks and balances.Featured Image Credits: Shopping vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "How to secure your Instagram account?",
    "data": "In my previous articles, I have discussed how you can secure your Facebook and WhatsApp accounts. In India alone, Instagram has over 100 million Instagram users. With the introduction of features like Reels and IGTV, the platform’s popularity has certainly increased. While it is an attractive platform for content creators and normal users alike, are you doing enough to secure your account? Let’s take a look.Is your password your partner’s name? Or is it your pet’s name, followed by @123? A strong password can help you minimise the chances of somebody successfully guessing your password when it comes to online platforms.I understand remembering passwords is quite difficult. So, here is a trick, instead of keeping my password as a straightforward vidhijain, I would put: 22!Dh!j@!n.Here is what I did: first, I replaced v by 22 as the alphabet comes at the twenty-second position in the alphabetical order. For each instance that i comes in my name, ! replaces it. I replace d with D and keep the h, j, and n as it is.For more information on how you should create strong passwords, you can check this article.Go to your profile on the Instagram app and tap on the three horizontal lines at the top right corner.Click on the Settings option at the bottom of your screen.Settings on InstagramAfter this, you will see a screen that looks like this.Settings on InstagramIn this section, we will be exploring various privacy settings. Click on the Privacy option.Settings > Privacy SettingsThe first and foremost recommendation is to keep your account private. When your account is public, everyone can see your posts. A private account gives you the control to decide who will be able to see what you are posting. Unless your profession requires you to keep your account public, keep your account private.Account PrivacyUnder the Interactions menu, click on the Comments option. From here, you can directly block certain individuals from commenting on your posts. You can also apply filters for hiding offensive comments. Instagram also allows users to set up manual filters by adding words that they find offensive.Interactions > CommentsFrom here, you can decide who can tag you in posts. My recommendation will be to turn on the feature of manually approving tags. Similarly, you can also decide who can mention you in stories, live views, comments, captions, etc.Interactions > Tags & MentionsFor limiting the audience for your stories, there are two possible options. First, you can create a list of Close Friends who can see your story. However, these individuals will know that they are a part of your close friends’ list. Second, you can hide your story from certain individuals. This way, these individuals do not know that they cannot view your story – unless someone tells them. Here, you can also allow replies and reactions from a limited number of individuals instead of everybody.Further, you can restrict if your story can be sent as a direct message or reshared. One more option available here lets you share your stories to Facebook if your Facebook and Instagram accounts are connected.Interactions > StoryInstagram allows users to decide which message requests will go where. For example, messages can directly appear in chats, or they can go to requests.Interactions > MessagesTo stay away from unwanted people, two options can be helpful to you. One way is to restrict their account without unfollowing or blocking them. If you restrict a user on Instagram, they will only see their comments on your posts. Moreover, they will not see if you are online or if you have read their messages.Another way is blocking. Blocking is simple. You cut that person out totally.Connections > Restricted Accounts & Blocked AccountsFrom the Settings menu, open the Security option. You should see a screen like this.Security Settings on InstagramUsing this feature, you can check the devices/locations where you are logged in. Check if there is any suspicious device or location. If you find a suspicious login, log out of all your sessions and change your password immediately. Ensure that you have enabled two-factor authentication for your account.Security > Login ActivityTwo-Factor Authentication (2FA) is a must. 2FA ensures that even if someone has access to your password, they cannot log into your account without the 2FA code. Instead of setting up through SMS, prefer using Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, or Duo. For enabling Google Authenticator on mobile, this link can be helpful.Security > Two-Factor AuthenticationHere are some miscellaneous security tips that will be helpful for you:Keep your passwords strong, just like we discussed in the first section. Do not keep the same password for all your accounts. Change your passwords once in three months.If you receive follow requests from unknown users, avoid them. You do not know who is sitting behind the screen on the other side.Make sure that your personal profile is not public. The only exception is when you are in a profession that requires extensive public presence.Two-Factor Authentication is a must. Having a backup when your password fails is a blessing.Which platform should I cover in my next article? Let me know in the comments.Featured Image Credits: Templates vector created by freepik – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Can employers collect vaccination data from their employees?",
    "data": "Many offices are now opening or planning to open soon with the increasing coverage of COVID-19 vaccines. To ensure the safety of their workplaces, some employers request their employees to submit a vaccination certificate to record their vaccination status. These certificates may ease the process of reopening offices. However, with the introduction of requirements such as vaccine passports, concerns have been raised about the privacy of personal health data and possible misuse. In this article, I will be discussing whether employers can collect vaccination data from their employees.Put plainly, vaccination certificates are medical records. Medical records fall under the definition of sensitive personal information, as per Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as SPDI Rules).Article 9 of GDPR considers health data as a special category of personal data. It specifies that a data subject must give explicit consent for the processing of health data. The purpose behind this processing can be for employment, social security, and social protection law. Given the sensitive nature of medical records, they directly touch an individual’s most intimate sphere. The unauthorised access or disclosure of medical records may result in a violation of individual rights and interests.Some examples where medical records are fraudulently used are:Obtaining medical services and other healthcare facilities through identity theftFraudulently claiming the insurance amountSelling medical records to a third partyAs offices reopen, companies require their employees to receive both the doses of their vaccine and submit their vaccination certificates. A vaccination certificate contains name, age, gender, ID verification status, beneficiary reference ID, vaccine name, dates of first and second doses, vaccine location, etc. The Ministry of Health and Family Welfare has also permitted the workplaces to conduct vaccination drives.Yes, they can. If your employer is an Indian company, they must collect and process this information as per the requirements laid down in the SPDI Rules. In a Gartner poll, only 8% of 227 human resource leaders of various companies stated that they are asking employees to show proof of their vaccination. 36% of participants submitted that they will only require employees to self-report their vaccination. Moreover, 48% of participants said that their company will not track the vaccination status of their employees.Purpose of collecting vaccination data, retention, and intended recipientsAccording to Rule 5 of the SPDI Rules, a body corporate shall only collect sensitive personal data for a lawful and necessary purpose connected to a function or activity. Here, if we understand that collecting vaccination data is essential to maintain health and safety standards in the workplace, the law will not impede the employers from collecting it. However, an employer that seeks to collect vaccination certificates will have to fulfill its obligations under the SPDI Rules.At the outset, they should clearly communicate the purpose of collecting vaccination certificates. For example, it can be to understand the vaccination status of employees before reopening their office. They should specify who will receive vaccination certificates and the duration for which they will be retained. The retention duration should be reasonable, and once the purpose is fulfilled, the stored information shall be destroyed accordingly.The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 also mentions situations when personal data can be processed for employment-related purposes. Such purposes include-Providing any service or benefit to employeesRecruitment/termination of employmentPerformance assessmentWhile employers cannot force employees to share their vaccine certificates mandatorily, they advise or find ways to lure them into giving information. One such method is providing attractive incentives to their employees for their vaccination status. A striking example is Walmart. This American multinational retail corporation offers $75 to employees who share proof of vaccination. Such incentives are so attractive that many forget about these records being sensitive personal information.If a company decides to collect vaccination certificates from its employees, it must comply with the requirements given in the SDPI Rules. An employer must consider the following recommendations:Asking whether an individual has taken their vaccination doses can be sufficient. Digging deeper into the specific details may lead to unfavourable situations. For example, an employee may not have taken the vaccine due to medical reasons.Employers should avoid strict internal policies regarding the submission of proof. Failure to submit should not affect the position and rights of the employees. If employees are submitting their certificates, employers must implement well-defined access level mechanisms in place.Providing sensitive personal information requires the free and express consent of an individual. An employer should ensure that its employees know the purpose behind such an exercise.Featured Image Credits: Certificate photo created by frimufilms – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "First Amendment Rights and Social Media Platforms",
    "data": "As humans cannot live without air and water, a democracy cannot survive without offering citizens an open podium to express their views. The US Constitution, through its First Amendment, provides for freedom of speech. It restricts the legislative power of Congress in framing laws that curtail the freedom of speech. However, it does not explicitly mention social media platforms, which has led to several debates over the years. Imagine you post something on a platform about the discrimination you faced. Hours later, the platform kicks you off by saying that you have shared hate speech. Will you not feel deprived of your freedom of speech? As far as my understanding goes, I am sure you will.The USA recently witnessed a decline in scores of the Democracy Index of 2020. The report suggested caged freedom of speech on social media platforms as one of the reasons for this decline. Is it possible to hold the First Amendment responsible for this situation?As per the First Amendment, freedom of speech is protected only against Congress. It indirectly allows social media platforms to limit freedom of speech without having any constitutional constraints. Consequentially, it leads to denial of freedom of speech in a practical sense. In a 2017 judgement, the US Supreme Court reversed a North Carolina Supreme Court judgement that recognised the validity of a state law prohibiting registered sexual offenders from using social media platforms. The majority opinion in Packingham v. North Carolina considered social media platforms as protected space under the First Amendment.Every social media platform has a dedicated set of terms and conditions. A user must accept them for using their platform. These terms and conditions talk about the types of users allowed, prohibited content, etc. Unfortunately, in this process, the oppressed section and minorities are more vulnerable to the selective harshness of fellow users as well as social media platforms. For example, in a 2020 study, researchers found that black individuals who posted about racial discrimination on social media were less likely to get a job offer. Further, the operation of political and economic pressures can often be termed as mere speculations. Former US President Donald Trump’s Twitter account suspension shows that social media platforms are beyond these forces. Considering the role of social media platforms in daily communication, the absence of specific obligations may act as an instrument of oppression.This question is the biggest debate concerning social media platforms and the First Amendment. One possible way to include social media platforms is by relying on the exception of public function, as discussed in Marsh v. Alabama. However, the courts have narrowed this concept over time by only considering the exclusive functions of the state. In Manhattan Community Access Corp v. Halleck, the US Supreme Court introduced the Common Sense Principle. According to this principle, it is commonly understood that social media platforms cannot be considered state actors. It is not only the government that provides an open platform to the public for expressing their views. This judgement essentially restricts the application of public function exception on social media platforms.On the one hand, we recognise social media platforms as a powerful communication medium. On the other hand, we do not have a solid mechanism for safeguarding freedom of speech on these platforms. For recognising freedom of speech on these platforms, the government and platforms must act together. A government can:frame rules for censorship and access to social media platforms,lay down rules for liability and accountability,implement grievance redressal mechanisms for grievances against social media platforms, andprovide incentives for self-regularisation.These actions can be supported by social media platforms by introducing transparency in how they self-regulate themselves. The platforms can:frame code of conduct for the users,carry out timely surveys for checking compliance,specify the types of prohibited content, andestablish a grievance redressal mechanism.To minimise the conflicts, self-regulation appears to be the best possible solution. A government may prefer to define the high-level requirements while the platforms work on the specifics.Featured Image Credits: Social media vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Hentai, Child Porn, and India",
    "data": "Should we worry about drawings? The usual way of determining whether a thing is so bad that it should be declared illegal and is of harm. If a thing harms no one, one should (ideally) not be stopped from doing it. After all, why should we care? No harm, no foul. Here, I will be examining drawings. More specifically, drawings of underage children engaging in sexually explicit acts originating in Japan. While an abstract examination of this is beyond the scope of this article, the aim is to contextualise Hentai in the legal framework of India. First, I’ll be discussing what Hentai is, and we will take it forward from there.In English, Hentai is a general term that one can simply understand as porn made in Japan. It exists in 2 major forms:Drawn: in the form of Manga.Animated: in the form of Anime.But Hentai in Japanese has a different definition. When it references sexual material, it is only used to describe the extreme kind (like rape). Within this definition also lie the two relevant sub-categories, lolicon and shotacon. Typically, lolicon involves underaged girls with men, while shotacon involves underaged boys with women. The acts depicted in this already extreme category can be horrible on multiple counts.  Perhaps due to the freedom of such a medium, the extreme within the extreme category can be pretty bad.It is not only limited to animated or drawn pornography. There are also adult games. A prime example of this is, RapeLay. In this, the player plays as a boy, and the aim is to rape women. Through the story, the player is supposed to violate a mother and her two daughters (the age of the youngest being 12). This sparked debates on how to deal with virtual child pornography (the children depicted are not real but fictional).While the overall debate is much broader in scope, let’s see what has been said in favour or against such depiction of children.It has been argued that consuming these materials will have negative effects on the mindset of the readers. Against this, scholars like Patrick W. Galbraith have argued that there is no data to show that lolicon has increased criminal acts. The child depicted is also virtual, so no real harm is done in the making or the proliferation of such material. In the context of how the consumers of such materials may react, he says:There is a gap between what fans think they are doing and how regulators understand their actions.For consumers of such material, the children depicted are not supposed to be stand-ins for real children. Thus, he argues, when this is equated with people seeing real child sexual abuse material (CSAM), the concern is misplaced. The reader knows the boundary between fiction and the real one. And rather than trying to be “real” (i.e., natural), manga and anime have their own autonomous fictional reality. They aren’t supposed to mimic the real world.Hentai is also a form of speech, a type of expression. As seen earlier, supposedly, no one is harmed in any way during its production and consumption. Thus, it has been argued that laws that ban the sexual representation of fictional children abrogate sexual civil liberties. This abrogation is usually justified in the name of protecting real children. McLelland argues against such a notion. They describe the Yaoi fandom as:more about elaborating ‘new shared worlds and critical languages, new bodies, new intimacies, and new citizenships’ among women fans rather than …. objectification of “children”.The fandom is thus inadvertently (and wrongly) treated as consumers of CSAM. McLelland also noted that in standards of decency, homosexual interaction can be classified as offensive in a homophobic society. When society still regards homosexuality as transgressive, it is conjoined with child sexuality.Rape myths are beliefs that the victims of sexual crimes themselves are responsible for what happened to them. Basically, they are myths that people believe about rape and rape victims. In terms of pornography, the danger is that what is depicted can result in people internalising rape myths, leading to various other problems. The understanding of consent in Hentai can be very problematic in such a context. “No” isn’t given much consideration, and there are also cases where a reluctant person subsequently starts liking it.“Rape” is a category of porn in itself, and it exists in virtual child pornography too. The effects of this can be acceptance of rape myths at some level by people. For example, there have been studies linking increased rape myth acceptance in women with using sexualised characters in video games. Another aspect is the objectification of women and the extension of harmful sexual stereotypes. Content like RapeLay treat women as objects and glorify stereotypes.Neil Levy argued that one of the most objectionable aspects of pornography is that:it presents women as naturally assuming a subordinate position in sex. Men are encouraged to think of themselves as active, penetrating subjects; women to conceive of themselves as penetrated objects. He argued that this can result in insubordination of women in other aspects of life, as humans cannot totally insulate these aspects of life. Extending this notion to virtual child pornography, he argues that children cannot be depicted as equals with the adults or the viewers in child pornography. Thus, child pornography, in any form, is an eroticisation of inequality.To uplift women, he further argues, inequality between men and women should not be a condition for sexual pleasure. Thus, virtual child pornography harms women by eroticising inequality.There are wider debates to be had in India about pornography, especially when transmitting obscene material itself is criminalized. But the relevant law here is Section 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000. It criminalises various aspects of child pornography, including browsing it. The relevant part reads as:… creates text or digital images, collects, seeks, browses, downloads, advertises, promotes, exchanges or distributes material in any electronic form depicting children in obscene or indecent or sexually explicit manner…It is clear, watching virtual child pornography is illegal in India. Yet, even on mainstream websites like Reddit, one can come across it easily.One might doubt the constitutionality of this section. If one can prove that no harm happens due to this, then isn’t criminalisation wrong? One blow to such a contention would be that free speech is not absolute in India; it is subject to reasonable restrictions. But as laws relating to obscenity evolve, the future can change. Virtual child pornography is illegal yet widely available in India (or anywhere in the world, for that matter).In terms of the earlier debates, the law has clearly rejected the arguments that favour virtual child pornography. It has considered this subject, a serious threat that merely browsing virtual child pornography can technically result in a fine of 5 lakh rupees and a jail time of 5 years. Yet one has to wonder, has anything changed? The act has been criminalised, but so what? The convictions under this section are negligible, if any have happened at all. The law in all its majesty has acted, but have any of the contentions of the debate been met?Regulating the internet is always a tall order. A “ban” as such might not be able to stop a majority of people from accessing the content anyways. In India, the widespread and easy availability of the internet is a relatively new phenomenon. In such a context, more open dialogue and awareness about the content one consumes and on topics like sexuality is much needed. Even if outright banning and criminalisation of virtual child pornography is right, the law has no real effects on the ground as it is. Thus the status quo continues illegally, but does that matter?Featured Image Credits: People vector created by pikisuperstar – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Why are E-Commerce Rules, 2020 important for consumers?",
    "data": "In 2021, we are reliant on internet-based services more than ever. In the times to come, this reliance is only going to increase. With COVID-19 restrictions and an increased push for home delivery services, some of us may have forgotten the fun of going shopping with our families in the local market. Groceries, vegetables, fruits, milk, medicines – name anything, and there will be an online marketplace for it. While online shopping is safe, swift, and convenient, are you aware of your rights as a consumer? Do you know that e-commerce entities have certain duties and liabilities, as prescribed by the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020?Rule 3(b) of the E-Commerce Rules defines an e-commerce entity. In simple words, an e-commerce entity means any platform where buying and selling of goods and services takes place digitally. There can be two types of e-commerce entities:Inventory e-commerce entity: This e-commerce entity sells its goods and services directly to the consumers. For example, I create a website for selling customised notebooks. (Rule 3(f))Marketplace e-commerce entity: This e-commerce entity provides a platform for sellers to sell their goods and services. For example, platforms Amazon and Flipkart allow sellers to upload their products for purchasing by prospective consumers. (Rule 3(g))The E-Commerce Rules apply to all the purchases and sale of goods and services made over an electronic or digital network. The scope includes all types of e-commerce retail platforms, including multi-channel single-brand retailers and single-brand retailers in either single or multiple formats. These rules will also apply to e-commerce entities based out of India but are offering their goods and services for sale and commercial purposes in India. One primary objective is to control unfair trade practices in digital space and recognise consumer rights in cyber space. These rules do not apply to any activity carried on by a person in their personal capacity.Rule 4 of the Consumer Protection (E-Commerce) Rules, 2020 lists down several duties of e-commerce entities.Incorporation: These rules require that an e-commerce entity be registered as a company incorporated as per India’s existing company laws. An e-commerce entity can also be a branch/office/agency outside India but owned or controlled by an Indian resident as per Section 2(v)(iii) of the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999.Disclosing necessary information: An e-commerce entity must provide the following information in a clear and accessible manner on their platform:\n\nThe legal name of the e-commerce entity\nAddresses, including the principal address and all branch addresses\nName and details of the website\nContact details, including e-mail address, fax, landline, and mobile numbers\nName, contact details, and designation of the Grievance Redressal Officer\nName and details of an importer of products, if any\n\nThe legal name of the e-commerce entityAddresses, including the principal address and all branch addressesName and details of the websiteContact details, including e-mail address, fax, landline, and mobile numbersName, contact details, and designation of the Grievance Redressal OfficerName and details of an importer of products, if anyUnfair trade practices: Rule 4(3) prohibits e-commerce entities from adopting unfair trade practices in their business and on their platform.Grievance redressal mechanism: An e-commerce entity must establish a grievance redress mechanism for redressing consumers’ grievances. These rules prescribe a time-frame of 48 hours in which a Grievance Redressal Officer must acknowledge the complaint. The maximum duration available for redressing a complaint is 30 days from the date of receipt.Convergence: An e-commerce entity has to ensure that they partner in the convergence process of the Central Government for the National Consumer Helpline.Cancellation Charges: When a consumer cancels any purchase order, an e-commerce entity cannot impose cancellation charges unless they also have to bear it.Consent: An e-commerce entity must record a consumer’s explicit and affirmative consent. They cannot record the consent automatically, including pre-ticked checkboxes.Refund: An e-commerce entity must process payments for accepted refund requests within a time-frame as prescribed by RBI or any other competent authority.Miscellaneous: An e-commerce entity must not manipulate the price of any good or service on its platform for gaining unreasonable profit. They should decide the price based on prevailing market conditions, essential nature of products, extraordinary circumstances, and any other relevant considerations. They must not discriminate or classify among consumers of the same class in a way that may affect the rights given under the Consumer Protection Act, 2019.This dedicated set of rules have come in the form of a blessing for the consumers. They strengthen the position of consumers as they seek to buy a product or service in the digital space. However, if consumers are not aware of their rights, the effectiveness of these rules will be negligible. As fellow consumers, we should be mindful of our rights so that e-commerce entities do not exploit us. Since no law is ever perfect, the same applies to these rules. For example, it does not talk about the extent of delivery charges an e-commerce platform may charge. All said and done, consumers can now shop online with lesser worry and better safeguards."

    "headline": "Can the police share pictures of missing children on social media?",
    "data": "India is witnessing an increasing number of cases of missing children. The distressed parents and guardians believe that circulating images of their child will help locate him or her quickly. With that in mind, they take the help of the police and spread the word on social media platforms. There are so many instances where social media has helped in uniting lost children with their families. For example, a three-year-old child went missing in 2016 at a railway station. With the help of social media platforms, she was found in a matter of 20 minutes.Some perpetrators have their eyes on the information of minors, and they may misuse it for acts such as kidnapping and trafficking. A UK-based couple found a shocking post on Facebook with a picture of their children captioned “Abducted – please help us find them.” This is an example of digital kidnapping wherein a perpetrator takes pictures of children from social media. They use these pictures with new names and identities and claim to be their parents. This incident shows that pictures of children can be misused even when they are casually posted.Also, some individuals even post pictures of children who are not missing. An example of this is a 2013 incident in the UK. A father published a picture of his children on Facebook, stating that they are missing. As a result, one person recognised the children and informed him of their location. The mother and her children were living under protection with a different identity after leaving the father. The person who informed the father was completely unaware of this fact.In some cases, perpetrators can misuse the pictures of children for baby role-playing. They post stolen pictures of children with fake details. The objective of perpetrators is to create baby role-playing accounts for impersonating a child or parent.Rule 92 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection of Children) Model Rules, 2016 deals with the inquiry process in missing children cases. The police must prepare Hue and Cry notices containing the photographs and the description of a missing child. Rule 92(4)(vi) specifies that, the police should give wide publicity by publishing this information in leading newspapers, television/electronic media, local cable TV network, and social media platforms. After this, the police must submit for ratification by the Children’s Court. So, it is clear that the police can publish pictures of missing children on social media platforms. In 2017, a three-year-old girl from Delhi went missing when she was playing with her friends. The police circulated her pictures via WhatsApp and Facebook. Eventually, they were able to locate the child in an ashram with the help of social media platforms.Section 3 of the Juvenile Justice Act, 2015 lays down a series of principles for the care and protection of children. The 11th principle recognises that the children have a Right to Protection of their privacy and confidentiality by all possible means throughout the judicial process.While weighing the pros and cons of the publicity of an abducted child, it is paramount to save the child first than anything else. The objective of finding the child should outweigh any other factor, and we must keep the following restrictions in mind:Individuals involved must keep the best interests of the child on the highest pedestal.Always verify the details of a case while sharing it across multiple platforms. Put simply, enquire before you blindly re-share.If the parents find their child, they should inform the public about the same so that information sharing can be prevented.Misuse of information about missing children must be prevented. Individuals that exploit this information must be prosecuted."

    "headline": "Will online dating amount to sexual consent?",
    "data": "Online dating apps like Tinder, Happn, Aisle, and Bumble have revolutionised dating in India. Users interact through these apps with other individuals they have never met before, based on their likes and dislikes over text messages and calls. This initial conversation may not give a complete idea about the kind of person they are talking to on the other side. This is where most problems lie, and uncertainty in giving and understanding consent is one of them.Indulging in sexual activities is an extensive desire behind the usage of dating apps. Many users, therefore, tend to think that this is the predominant purpose of dating apps. In the light of these statements, I will be discussing the concept of sexual consent in this article. Put plainly, we can define sexual consent as consent given to perform sexual activities. A crucial aspect of any sexual assault or violence is the absence of consent. In online dating space, users usually grant sexual consent through messages before actually meeting the other party in person. In a study conducted by David S. Hall, he found that most sexual activities progress with consent granted non-verbally. When a party grants non-verbal consent, the other party can easily misinterpret or misunderstand what is being agreed to.Consent practices vary significantly from case to case. However, as per the existing literature, there are two types of computer-mediated consent processes.Consent signalling: This is where parties use the interface of a dating app to give their implied consent to sexual activities without any explicit validation of consent. In simpler terms, you consent to sexual activities by using the app and without any overt confirmation. The users are required to understand that such an app intends to help them in finding sexual partners.Affirmative consent: The parties express their overt consent to performing sexual activities before meeting in person. Later, when they meet, this is verbally reconfirmed face-to-face. It necessitates the parties to give consent free from uncertainty like a humble no or a shy yes. Some of the apps inform the users to seek consent from each other before engaging in sexual activities.News reports throw light on the negative side of the dating apps such as rape, harassment, extortion, cheating, etc. At times, consent is taken from a party through force, coercion, and undue influence. In Pune, a man raped an air hostess he met through Tinder. The accused allegedly forced her to drink alcohol. Later, he forced himself upon her and raped her even when she did not give her consent in the first place. Research has shown that dating app users report lower levels of sexual consent and higher levels of sexual coercion and violence, including sexual assault, sexual harassment, and rape.Men and women have reported the pressures they have undergone to commit sexual activities. However, most of them hesitate to say no as they feel unsafe in doing so. Such behaviour can be expected regardless of any dating app we use because there are people who use these platforms only to victimise other users.There are also instances where dating apps enable person to pretend like somebody they are not or be deceitful. The promises made under such impersonation may lead to sexual consent from the other party. In Bengaluru, the police arrested a man for allegedly cheating and raping a woman he met on a dating app. The accused pretended to be an unmarried man and also made a promise of getting married to the victim.Even though dating apps try to provide a safe and healthy experience, the spike in the number of cases that we receive make us question the verification process deployed by dating apps. This rise in the number of cases has made it even more necessary to discuss the significance of consent. Based on the unfortunate incidents happening around us, we can infer that anyone can use these apps and present themselves as approachable and harmless. From the examples discussed above, it is possible to obtain sexual consent when the other party is:under the influence of alcohol and/or drugsunder the impression that the person or the promises are genuineAnd there will be instances where a party does not obtain the consent at all.As a user, it is best for us to be a step forward and follow necessary precautions while using online dating apps.Understand the app’s purpose thoroughly and its various features.Do not give consent with uncertainty. At the same time, do not say no with uncertainty or ambiguity.Avoid extensive sharing of your personal information before verifying the identity.Prefer meeting the person face-to-face in public places and avoid isolated locations.Share information with a friend or a family member before leaving for your date.If any of the above given scenarios happen with you, do not give up. There are legal provisions available to protect you and hold the individual responsible for their actions. Some of these provisions include Sections 292, 354A, 354B, 354C, 354D, 376, and 503 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, along with Sections 66C, 66D, 66E, 67, and 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.

    "headline": "How to secure your WhatsApp account?",
    "data": "In my last article, I elaborated on various steps that you can take to secure your Facebook account. The focus now shifts to WhatsApp, a common name in every household. There are over 2 billion WhatsApp users globally. WhatsApp is a proper noun that has become a verb. I am sure you have used sentences like ye mujhe WhatsApp kar dena, or can you WhatsApp me this picture? We are heavily dependent on WhatsApp, and with WhatsApp Web, we are even more comfortable. In this article, we look at various security measures you can adopt to secure your WhatsApp account.Open WhatsApp on your phone. In the top right corner, you will see three dots arranged vertically. Tap here and select Settings from the dropdown.Three dots in the top-right cornerSelect the Settings optionThe application will redirect you to a page that looks like this.Available settings on WhatsAppTap on the Account option, and you will see a total of six options:PrivacySecurityTwo-step verificationChange numberRequest account infoDelete my accountAccount Settings on WhatsAppTap on the Privacy option you see, and you will be able to access various privacy settings for WhatsApp. This includes last seen, profile photo, about, status, read receipts, live location, blocked contacts, and fingerprint lock.Privacy Settings on WhatsAppThis feature enables you to decide the users you want to share your last seen with.If you select Everyone, then everyone who knows your number can see your last seen. It does not matter whether they have saved your contact or not. Your last seen tells the other user about the last time you opened WhatsApp. This is not recommended at all.Instead, you can choose to share your last seen with your contacts only by selecting the My contacts option. Now, only your contacts can see your last seen on WhatsApp.The third option is to avoid sharing your last seen with anybody. If you select this option, no user will be able to see your last seen. In return, you will not be able to see anyone’s last seen as well.Who can see your last seen?Just like last seen, you can allow everyone to view your profile picture. However, any good cyber safety expert will not be in favour of this. You can allow your contacts to view your profile photo or simply choose Nobody.Profile photo visibilityThis feature enables you to provide information about yourself using 139 characters. It can be any message you want to give or any information you wish to share. Again, you have three options to choose from: Everyone, My contacts, and Nobody.About SettingsWhatsApp allows you to put up pictures, videos, or simple text messages that remain available for 24 hours. You have three options to decide who can see your status:My contacts: All your contacts can see your status.My contacts except…: Your status is visible to all your contacts, except those you select.Only share with…: Instead of sharing your status with all the contacts at large, your status is only visible to the contacts you select.Status privacyDo you know you can prevent other users from adding you to groups? Using this feature, you can allow everyone or only your contacts to add you to various groups. Further, you can select contacts that cannot add you to a WhatsApp group.Who can add you to WhatsApp groups?WhatsApp allows users to share their live location. Be extremely careful while sharing your live location. If it is necessary to share, share your live location only for the required time and verify that you are sending your location to a genuine person. Never share your live location with a stranger just because they asked for it.Live location settingsYou can block any other user at any time. You can either go to that person’s profile and block them from there. Alternatively, you can open the Blocked contacts option and add a user to your blocked list.Blocked ContactsThis is an in-built feature in WhatsApp which requires fingerprint authentication every time you open the application. However, you can also set the duration for an automatic lock.Fingerprint LockThis feature allows you to add a security PIN to your account. WhatsApp will ask this PIN at different times to ensure that only you are using your account. Further, if you change your mobile device and access your account, WhatsApp will ask for this PIN after the one-time password (OTP) is verified. So, if you somehow end up sharing your OTP, do not share your pin in any case whatsoever.Two-step verificationApart from the security measures I discussed above, there are a few more things that you should take care of.Avoid replying to people you do not know. Always do a background check and do not outrightly believe a user’s identity.Regularly check your contact list. At times, we end up saving numbers that we only needed once or twice. For example, a cab driver who cancelled your ride.Keep a tab on WhatsApp Web access for your account. Do not give your phone to anyone without your supervision, as they can scan the WhatsApp Web QR in a matter of few seconds and get access to your chats.WhatsApp is a breeding ground for fake news and misinformation. Never believe the forwarded messages. Avoid blindly forwarding messages you receive on WhatsApp.Featured Image Credits: Technology psd created by syifa5610 – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "A Beginner’s Guide to Ransomware",
    "data": "In the last decade or so, cyber attacks have evolved tremendously in their size and impact. I am sure you would have come across the term ‘ransomware’ multiple times in newspapers and blog articles. Put simply, ransomware is a type of malware that holds your device captive until you pay the ransom. Usually, attackers ask for ransom in the form of cryptocurrencies.Ransomware, like any other malware, has to be introduced into our system. Emails are considered one of the most prominent ways to spread a ransomware variant. Primarily, there are two attack vectors associated with emails. In the first type, emails contain deceptive attachments that trick the users into opening them. As a user downloads and opens an attachment, the malicious files execute and infect the system. The second attack vector, though less popular, redirects a user to a random website which may ask for downloading files or irrelevant permissions.Ransom Screen for WannaCry RansomwareAnother prominent way through which ransomware proliferates is the drive-by downloads. We often have a knack for searching for things for free. For example, there is an application that requires you to pay ₹100 to use it. Instead, we will search for free or modded versions on Google. The same applies to songs, videos, movies, and TV series. Perpetrators exploit this habit by adding malicious code to whatever we wish to download. On the face of it, you will only see a song getting downloaded. But alongside, there will be an unwanted guest that is most likely to hold your system to a ransom. In some cases, perpetrators can leave USB drives at certain places for individuals to pick up. Once they insert this drive into their personal system, ransomware comes into action.When a ransomware infects your system successfully, it encrypts your files. The exact encryption method may vary from one variant to another. In most cases that I have seen, users have lost their files as there was no backup in place. The risk is even higher in corporate organisations as a successful ransomware attack would require them to invest additional man-hours in the containment of the incident. Further, the security teams will make changes to the IT infrastructure. On top of this, reputational and legal risks also come into the picture for corporate organisations. While whether you should pay the ransom is highly debatable, small and medium enterprises face a potential risk of going out of the business if they do not recover from the incident in the minimum time possible.1. Apocalypse: The security community discovered this ransomware in 2016. This variant used a custom algorithm for encryption instead of using standard algorithms. Before it could create any substantial impact, it was successfully eradicated.2. Cerber: Discovered in 2016, this ransomware encrypts files on an infected system using a .cerber extension. It uses RSA and RC4 encryption algorithms.3. CTB_Locker: This ransomware uses a more sophisticated algorithm than RSA. Alongside, it adopts AES and ECDH algorithms. ECDH is an anonymous protocol that deals with the key agreement.4. Jigsaw: This ransomware encrypts files on an infected system using a .fun extension. It runs on the .NET framework and adopts the AES algorithm.5. WannaCry: WannaCry exploited a vulnerability in Windows operating system. It is believed that this variant infected more than 400,000 systems across the globe. This ransomware demanded payments in Bitcoin. It wreaked havoc in the year 2017.6. Petya: Petya is considered to be an advanced version of WannaCry. Similarly, it asked for the ransom amount in Bitcoins.7. Conti: Conti emerged in 2019, and it was responsible for 13% of the total attacks in the year 2020. In one instance, the attackers were able to infect a school’s system and demanded a ransom of $40 million. The attackers also threatened to post the collected information online if the school did not pay the ransom.8. REvil: REvil is an example of ransomware-as-a-service, which primarily targeted businesses in the engineering sector.The recent attack on Colonial Pipeline, a US-based company, is a ransomware attack.ISS World, a Denmark-based company, lost around $74 million due to a ransomware attack in February 2020.Cognizant lost over $70 million because of the Maze ransomware attack in April 2020.Sopra Steria, an IT-service firm, suffered an operating loss of €50 million due to a ransomware attack in October 2020.Software AG, a leading Germany-based software vendor, disclosed that their systems were infected by the Clop ransomware. The attackers demanded $23 million in ransom.The University of California San Francisco’s School of Medicine was targeted by ransomware in June 2020. UCSF negotiated with the attackers and paid $1.14 million in ransom.Travelex, a money exchange firm, paid a ransom of $2.3 million in Bitcoins to regain access to their data.The biggest debate concerning ransomware attacks is whether one should pay the ransom or not. Organisations with poor security measures in place will not have multiple backups of their data. It will be virtually impossible for them to resume their business operations without accessing data in such instances. Hence, they would have no other option but to pay the ransom. However, there are plenty of examples we can find where organisations refused to make the ransom payment. These organisations had made sufficient investments in their security mechanisms. Their IT infrastructure was robust enough to survive the attack and resume business operations at the earliest.We rely on a cyber space where cyber attacks will never decrease. As an individual, you have to ensure that you do not become an easy target. As an organisation, you should ensure that you invest in people, process, and technology and follow a comprehensive approach to your organisational security. Given that prevention is better than cure, here are a few things that we can start doing right now:Take regular backups for your personal as well as organisational data.Check for decryption keys on the internet and security forums.Regularly update your applications as soon as your vendor releases an update or patch.Do not insert USB drives from unknown sources into your computer system.Explore the possibility of taking a backup in your preferred cloud service.Recommended ReadingsHow to protect yourself from ransomware data loss?Download Safe and avoid RansomwareFeatured Image Credits: Abstract vector created by vectorjuice – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "How to secure your Facebook account?",
    "data": "Whatever we do today is linked to the internet, in one way or other. Looking for a recipe, ordering food & groceries, and booking an appointment are some of those things you regularly do. Educational institutions have adopted internet-based platforms for the continuous delivery of education amidst the ongoing pandemic. With work from home in place for most companies, lines between personal and professional boundaries have also blurred.In the first lockdown, everyone I know turned chef and showed their culinary skills. If I cooked something at home, I need to tell my friends and family about it. So, I write a drooling caption and post the pictures everywhere – WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and whatnot. I order a beautiful dress online, and when I receive it, I post my picture across my social media accounts. I go on a vacation to Goa, and I update my status, letting my friends know that I am drinking fresh coconut water. Aren’t we oversharing? Meanwhile, someone, somewhere, is looking at my nude pictures, which I never posted or shared with anyone. How did this happen? I never shared or even clicked such a picture. Neither did I share my passwords with anybody. My dear friends, having a password is not enough. Perpetrators can save your images from different social media platforms and morph them into something you cannot even think about. So, what else can we do? In this series of articles, I will be discussing various security settings available on different platforms. In this article, we will be starting with Facebook. With over 2.6 billion active users across the globe, Facebook is the largest social media platform. In one of our previous articles, we have talked about more than 100 security settings on Facebook. I am sure you are surprised by this number, but this is the truth. We choose to remain ignorant.Your password should be something that only you know. Your password should not be your name, mobile number, date of birth, or any information others know. Most certainly, it should not be your partner’s name. Perpetrators can easily guess passwords and get access to your account. Your password should have a reasonable length, and it must be strong.I understand remembering passwords is quite difficult. So, here is a trick, instead of keeping my password as a straightforward vidhijain, I would put: 22!Dh!j@!n.Here is what I did: first, I replaced v by 22 as the alphabet comes at the twenty-second position in the alphabetical order.

Never use the same password again and change your password frequently. Refer to Section 1 of this article to get an idea about creating strong passwords.Quoting one of our answers on Quora,Two-factor authentication (2FA) apps like Google Authenticator helps save the day when a hacker gets access to your password and attempts to login to your accounts. Using 2FA apps is essentially like putting a gatekeeper inside your house, even though you have put a lock outside. Most of the platforms offer integration with 2FA apps like Google Authenticator, Microsoft Authenticator, and Duo. So, even if a person is somehow able to retrieve your password, they would still need the code generated by the 2FA app. Without this code, they would not be able to log in to your accounts.Two-factor authenticationJust below the two-factor authentication option, you can find a list of devices you have authorised. On these devices, Facebook will not ask you to enter the 2FA codes.Manage Authorized LoginsScroll down on the Settings page and enable the alerts for unrecognised logins. Once you enable them, Facebook will notify you if someone logs into your account from a device or browser that you do not usually use.Login Alerts for Unrecognized LoginsUsing this feature, you can select the contacts that will help you log into your account if you get locked out. This can come in handy when you encounter any trouble in accessing your account. You can choose three to five friends as your trusted contacts.Choosing trusted contactsTurn on the Safe Browsing option so that you do not end up opening any potentially dangerous or deceptive website through Facebook.Safe BrowsingNow, scroll down on the Settings page, and you will find an option called Privacy Settings. In this section, we will primarily look at ways to minimise the number of individuals that can access our data.Privacy SettingsTap on the Manage your profile option to change who can see various personal information about you such as your hometown and current city, email, birthday, relationships, etc.Manage your profileWhen you lock your profile, you put a restriction on who can see what. Users who are not your friends can only see a maximum of five profile details.Locking your profileThis set of settings will help you review who can post on your profile, share your posts to their stories, and see posts you are tagged in.Profile & TaggingWith the help of this feature, you can prevent another user from contacting you in any manner or view any information on your Facebook profile. Put simply, they will not be able to access your profile.Blocked ListFrom here, you can control Facebook’s access to your location. If your location history is enabled, Facebook will utilise this data to provide location-specific services. Our recommendation is to turn this feature off and delete the location history from here if it exists.Location SettingsFor the stories you add on Facebook, you can control who can see and share your story. From this section, you can also configure who can see story highlights on your profile. Using the Stories you muted option, you can check the list of your friends whose stories are not visible to you.Story SettingsFacebook provides a feature called the profile picture guard. Once you enable it by tapping on your profile picture, other users cannot download it or take a screenshot. However, one may argue that a second device can be used to click a picture. To overcome this, tap on your profile picture and you will find an option to add a design to your photos. This feature makes it very difficult for anybody to misuse your picture. As per our Creative Head, it is almost impossible to perfectly remove the design and retrieve the original picture once you put a design over it.Adding a guard and designAbsolute security is a myth. As end-users, we can ensure that we use all possible security settings to ensure maximum security of our social media accounts. We, at The Cyber Blog India, strongly recommend using these security and privacy settings to minimise the chances of misuse.

    "headline": "Shock & Awe Tactics: Casual Violence on Social Media",
    "data": "Violence today is nothing but a manifestation of anger, ego, deceit, and greed. The intention of any violent activity is to cause hurt. In the recent past, we have heard and read about many cases where individuals of all age groups have indulged in violent activities. The reason for the same can be directly linked to the kind of content they watch online. One can debate that merely watching these acts online is not enough to make a person violent. This argument can be partly true, but do we need this type of content on social media platforms anyway?Trigger Warning: This article contains links to the content that is violent in nature. Reader discretion advised.Let’s take the example of Gautam Buddha. He was kept within the four walls of his palace as a boy until he insisted that he wanted to know about the outside world. As he went out, he came across a new environment where people were suffering, old, poor, and dying. Inside the palace walls, he had not seen this at all.Being aware that violence exists globally and seeing it on social media platforms are two different things. Watching violent content can manifest into nerve-wracking feelings or emotions. In the past few years, the amount of violent content on social media platforms has increased. The question that we should ask is:Does this type of content play a role in today’s youth developing violent behaviour?This theory talks about the acceptance of criminal activity in society. It says that when criminal activity is seen as acceptable in society or the effect of which has been neutralised, it starts to gain momentum as normal. Similarly, our present generation is exposed to violent content to the extent that some may begin to think of this as normal. We are sure you would have come across incidents where pedestrians are more interested in recording the act instead of helping or probably saving an individual’s life.This video is about a violent act committed by the family members and relatives of a patient. The patient was suffering from Septicemia. As soon as they came to know that the patient had died, they ransacked the private hospital and damaged its property on the afternoon of April 27, 2021. However, it was later known that the patient was alive, and the news was nothing but a rumour.This video is related to an incident in Chhabra, a town in Rajasthan’s Baran district. Three young men stabbed the victim over a minor argument. On April 10, 2021, this incident took place and led to a major communal tension on the next day itself. Several vehicles and shops were burned down.The third video shows the cruel and unkind behaviour of two Indore police constables. In this video, they are seen beating a 35-year old man for not wearing a mask. As per COVID-19 guidelines, wearing a mask was mandatory in the city. As per an official statement issued later, they were suspended.This video is from Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh, where the general public brutally thrashed the police officials in anger. The anger was primarily due to the inaction of police officers as a girl was raped in a private hospital where she was admitted as a patient. Due to this incident, five police officers were badly injured.In this video from Rajendra Nagar, Pune, a person crushed his neighbour over a small conflict. The CCTV cameras installed on the premises recorded the entire incident. The footage shows that this person beat his neighbour 10 times, and others had to intervene to save the victim’s life.These are just five instances, and they are not even the tip of the iceberg. There are thousands of videos out there from across the country. Do we need these videos on social media platforms that users often browse through casually? Do we not have sufficient laws to take down such content? Is it enough for social media platforms like Facebook or Instagram to show a trigger warning?If we look into the laws focusing on violent content on social media platforms, the chances of actually finding relevant laws are almost zero. However, the situation seems to have improved slightly after the introduction of the Information Technology (Guidelines for Intermediaries and Digital Media Ethics Code) Rules, 2021.In this guideline, Part I(b) of the Schedule states that an online content curating platform should classify the content if it is of violent nature. It is safe to infer that violent content has to be treated differently. Its moderation/regulation cannot be the same as the content you would usually encounter on social media platforms. Further, Part II(c) expects online content curators to give a higher classification level when a piece of content portrays potentially dangerous behaviour. As per Part II(g), decisions related to content classification must consider the degree and nature of the work. For example, this can cover instances where:Violence is a normal solution to the problems;Callousness towards victims;Encouraging aggressive attitudes;Heroes inflicting pain and injury;Fictional characters taking pleasure in humiliation/pain;Sadistic/sexual violence, or conduct that demeans human dignity; andGlorification/glamorisation of violence.Rule 45 of the Norms of Journalistic Conduct mentions that violence shall not be glorified. It specifies that media must not post any content that glorifies violence, such as photos and videos.Facebook’s Community Standards specify that the platform does not tolerate content that glorifies violence in any way.Facebook’s Community Standards on Violent and Graphic ContentInstagram’s Community Guidelines are on similar lines as Facebook, and the platform may remove videos/images of graphic violence.YouTube has a dedicated policy on violent and graphic content. It lists the type of content that the platform does not allow and states that this list is not exhaustive.YouTube’s Violent or Graphic Content PolicyContent regulation and the right to freedom of speech and expression are two issues that will continue to remain at loggerheads. While Indian law explicitly grants this right as a fundamental right under Article 19(1), content moderation will never be easy. As a reader and fellow internet user, you may argue in favour of one issue over another. However, one must consider that everybody uses social media – irrespective of their age and gender. There is no denying that minors are more vulnerable than adults and their minds are still malleable. Coming across violent content regularly can have harmful effects on a child’s mindset and how they perceive violence. As we conclude, we hope that platforms will improve their reporting mechanisms, and their algorithms will continue to get more efficient in detecting violent content.Jointly authored by Srushti Iyer and Yash Jain.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Big Tech, Politics, and Scandals",
    "data": "When Christopher Wylie was in his mid-teens, he expressed hopes of becoming a statesman. If not, he assumed he would be another small merchant resorting to Machiavellian methods to sell petty goods. A decade later, he finds a place in the list of Time Magazine’s “100 Most Influential People 2018” for blowing the lid on Cambridge Analytica malpractices and making Facebook cough up billions in fines. When asked to testify about the ordeal, he spoke about the risks of big IT companies’ power and of a novel Cold War emerging in the cyber space. In his book Mindf*ck, he says,Why should we allow Big Tech to conduct scaled human experiments, only to realise that they become too big a problem to manage?Big Tech refers to the five most prominent IT companies in the US – Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, and Apple. These companies are enormously powerful in the cyber space, and it is impossible to imagine an internet without them. Facebook and Google account for more than 70% of all web traffic. Their popularity continues to soar even after criticism, scandals, data leaks, and anti-trust lawsuits. This is primarily because of their free services and the central role their systems play in our everyday lives.Lately, the enormous influence of IT companies has come into increased scrutiny. Data leaks, privacy concerns, and influence in state affairs are factors responsible for this. Limited accountability and wanton disregard for the intellectual property of users simply add fuel to the fire. When predictive analytics were first developed in 1689, they were used on a smaller scale in underwriting to help disseminate important information in insurance services. The growth of social media revolutionized the scale on which these worked. Now, these algorithms can easily predict our conduct with embarrassing accuracy.They study our behaviour – how much time we spend on a particular site, what we look at, what we like and share, even how long we look at a particular thing. Thus, it collects all sorts of data about us – who we like, what questions we’re asking, whose profile we keep going to, what keeps us up at night, what makes us angry, and what makes us tick.Big Tech companies use predictive analysis for showing ads to the users. These algorithms provide us with personalised ads based on what site we are likely to visit, what page we might like to open, and which product we are more likely to buy. The situation becomes grave, particularly in political ads, since parties can roll out personalised ads for different kinds of people, cherry-picking a certain item in their agenda that one might support. The claim might be misleading or outrightly false. In a U.S. Congress hearing, Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez asked Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg about advertising lies as political advertisements. Visibly befuddled, he said, “I don’t know.”So, a political party with more money can roll out greater ads and influence voters’ decision-making. They can also test how influential a certain advert is by looking at engagement and response data. If one advert is not generating enough engagement, they can change it in real-time. When companies want to, they can also influence people’s behaviour, showing them little by little, the narrative they want them to support. These sites have billions of users and a serious dearth of employees or fact-checkers to decide what the objective truth is and isn’t.Moreover, companies like Google also have customized news feeds, which show personalized content, often detailing only one side of the story. The algorithm keeps showing people more and more content on views they already support, wiping out debate and discussion and creating personalized echo chambers. Each post thrusts people into binary conflicting sides and feeds on these divisions. On the other hand, it also rewards controversy, as more controversy means more engagement, more ads, and more profit.In 2010, Facebook launched a platform called Open Graph that allowed third-party apps to ask Facebook users for permission to access their personal data. “This is Your Digital Life” was one such app, and it branded itself as a personality quiz. It asked users to answer questions based on their behaviour and psychology. The app claimed that these questions are for academic purpose, and after completing the quiz, it paid the users. The app found a loophole in Facebook that allowed it to obtain the data of users’ friends as well. Subsequently, it shared the collected data of millions of respondents and their friends with Cambridge Analytica.  Cambridge Analytica, in turn, used this data to launch targeted political ads on Facebook.Cambridge Analytica was established as a subsidiary of the SCL group. Conservative Robert Mercer founded this company on the promise of profiling users and influencing their behaviour. It was a political consulting firm on record, and it started off by helping Ted Cruz in his presidential campaign in 2015-16. With funding and analytical tools available, it did not have the data to make its idea work. It wooed Russian-American Aleksandr Kogan for procuring data, and the data was bought from Kogan’s app (This Is Your Digital Life).Subsequently, the company started creating psychological profiles for individuals. The ad campaign utilised these profiles to create tailored ads and influence the voters to vote for Cruz. It specifically categorised individuals into categories like “True Believer” and “Stoic Traditionalist.” In late 2015, Facebook became aware of this incident and how data was illegally obtained. Cambridge Analytica responded that they did not know about this and they would destroy it. As this incident started gaining traction, Facebook stopped the ads and removed Cambridge Analytica pages from its platform. Cruz claimed that the data was legally acquired; however, it was unreliable and not worth the money. Later, he dropped out of the presidential race, and the firm began working for Donald Trump.After Cruz’s failed campaign, Cambridge Analytica started working for Donald Trump in his presidential bid. This time, they categorised individuals in broad categories, such as Trump Supports, of if they can be influenced to swing in his favour. For the first category, the ads displayed a triumphant Trump, along with the details of polling booths. For the second category, negative visuals of the rival candidate, Hillary Clinton, were shown along with major Trump supports. In one instance, Politico, a news website, published an interactive graphic that looked like genuine journalism, but it was actually sponsored content and criticised Clinton thoroughly.One of the ads during the Trump campaignIn 2015, the Leave campaign boasted about working with Cambridge Analytica on its website to better engage the voters. The Communications Director of the campaign had recommended the company to others. However, they later denied any involvement and claimed that no paid/unpaid work was done. According to Wylie, the Leave campaign worked with Cambridge Analytica through a third company called Aggregate IQ. Leaked emails between the parties further substantiated this stance. The UK’s Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO) launched an investigation and concluded that Cambridge Analytica was not involved. However, Facebook paid a penalty of £500,000 for not putting in place sufficient safeguards for protecting user data.In 2017, the true scale of this breach came to light. Carole Cadwalladr, an investigative journalist, convicted Wylie to divulge the working of Cambridge Analytica. A year later, he came forward publically with the allegation of misuse of user data. These allegations set off a series of investigations that demonstrated the true extent of the leak. After significant public outrage in early 2018, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg apologised for the situation and called it a mistake. Facebook entered into a settlement with ICO and FTC and paid a fine of $5 billion. It entered into another settlement with SEC and paid $100 million.This scandal gained widespread public attention, and the number of likes, comments, and shares on Facebook decreased by almost 20%. Since then, the engagement has continued to decrease. On Twitter, some users started a #DeleteFacebook movement, but it failed to materialise. Another campaign called #OwnYourData was started, and it demanded greater transparency from Facebook. A documentary on this incident called “The Great Hack” is available on Netflix.In the last 5-6 years, the number of Internet users in India has increased by at least four-folds. Mobile phones and data packs are cheaper than ever. While this sudden influx of netizens may go a long way in increasing connectivity and modernisation, it leads to rampant fake news. The most common vehicle for rumours to ride on is WhatsApp. Often, YouTube videos become a medium of information that users share on other social media platforms such as Facebook and Twitter. According to a Hindustan Times report, regional platforms like ShareChat and Helo are equally littered with fake information.An Oxford study found that India forms a part of the countries where political parties have an organised social media manipulation campaign. A BBC report showed that lines between social media platforms and news sites have been blurred, as there is cynicism about the traditional media agencies and their motivations. Users continue to share unverified information through social media under the impression that it is their civic duty. Often, nationalistic fervour or identity politics drives people to share such messages. This reaffirms people’s identity, and it trumps the authentication of facts. The report further highlighted that the motivation behind sharing fake news is tied up with socio-political identity. To read more on the proliferation of fake news through platforms like WhatsApp, click here.Categorisation of messages shared within private networks in IndiaIn the 2019 General Elections, major political players had extensive plans for social media campaigning, with thousands of individuals assigned for launching campaigns on WhatsApp. The Election Commission had to intervene and frame guidelines that allowed for the scrutinisation of social media posts. It launched an app called eVigil to report any violation of its Model Code of Conduct, including hate speech and fake news. Further, it asked the leading social media platforms to silence political advertisements for 48 hours before the polls. It also directed social media companies to draft their own Code of Ethics for self-regulation.One reason for the popularity of these services is that they are free and easy to access. However, as artist Richard Serra puts it,If it’s free, you are the product.Big Tech companies have enormous power, as is clear from the discussion so far. With time and an increasing user base, it only seems to be growing. It is easy to feel powerless in this situation at a personal level. However, at the end of the day, our data allows them to exert this enormous influence over society. We consent to give away all this data every time we go down a YouTube rabbit hole or start searching for products we will never buy on Amazon. This directly and negatively impacts our life. The recognition of this fact is essential to combat their stranglehold. There are various ways to stop being a slave of the algorithm. For example, you can use TrackMeNot to falsify search data. It requires a few uncomfortable hits and misses, but with determined resolve, it is possible to mitigate the problems significantly.This article has been written by Akshita Rohatgi, an undergraduate student at the University School of Law and Legal Studies, GGSIPU, during her internship with The Cyber Blog India in January/February 2021.Featured Image Credits: Background photo created by kjpargeter – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Obscenity and WhatsApp Stickers",
    "data": "WhatsApp recently became the talk of the town when it decided to update its privacy policy. This move triggered the users to explore other messaging platforms like Telegram and Signal. A lawyer also filed a petition before the Delhi High Court challenging this move. This petition states that WhatsApp is performing a public function, despite being a private entity. All said and done, I barely know more than a couple of individuals who deleted their WhatsApp account and switched to other platforms altogether.Disclaimer: Due to the nature of the content involved, part(s) of one or multiple pictures in this article are blurred, cropped, or hidden.Amidst all these debates, I came across many obscene stickers on WhatsApp and decided to explore their creation and proliferation. Needless to say, stickers are available on pretty much every messaging application today. For this article’s purpose, I will be focusing on WhatsApp, considering its massive userbase in India. While Indian law requires you to be at least 18 years of age for entering into a contract, every teenager you know will have a WhatsApp account.Some examples of stickers depicting young cartoon characters in a sexually explicit manner.In my opinion, WhatsApp has acquired the nature of a public platform where billions of private conversations are taking place. Many of you might have come across stickers (or memes in the form of stickers) that depict celebrities, politicians, cricketers, or public figures. Usually, stickers are either animated or morphed images, while others are GIF files. We may call them video stickers. For morphed stickers, I do not think sticker creators ask for the permission of the concerned individual. You will see that video stickers depict content that one can easily classify as sexually explicit in some cases.Third-party apps allow users to create personalised stickers and send them through WhatsApp.Apart from the stickers available by default, WhatsApp also allows users to manually add stickers. There are various applications available on the Play Store that allow users to create their own stickers. Often, these stickers bear the watermark of the application through which a user created them.While going through some of the sticker making apps, I observed that they recommend parental guidance and are only for users above 12 years of age. The big question here is whether parental guidance or age restriction serves the cause? Definitely not. Consider that I create a sticker with sexually explicit content. No one can stop me from sending it to a minor. The bottom line is, everyone can access stickers with such content, irrespective of their age.Messaging platforms offer stickers as a means to make our communication easier and enjoyable. However, third-party apps that allow the users to create personalised stickers defeat the very purpose why this feature was introduced. I know a good number of WhatsApp users in my circle that create and circulate obscene stickers in groups as well as in personal conversations. Third-party apps make it very easy for an individual to use your picture and morph it into something that you may find inappropriate. There are chances that somebody has used your picture for creating a sticker, and you have no idea about it. This sticker can be defamatory or depict content that is either obscene or sexually explicit. In legal terminologies, there is no denying that stickers that show sexually explicit content in the form of cartoons can corrupt the minds of children.Obscene and sexually explicit stickers on WhatsAppSection 66E of the Information Technology Act, 2000 provides punishment for the violation of privacy. It emphasises a person’s intention to capture or transmit the image of an individual’s private area. If an individual uses your picture without your consent and shares it on a messaging platform, it is not difficult to prove that this act was intentional. Such an act may fall within the ambit of this provision as it explicitly mentions transmission.Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 provides punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene content in electronic form. It includes any content that is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest to the extent that it corrupts an individual’s mind. The majority of stickers that you will see are likely to attract this section. Obscenity continues to be a grey area in Indian laws, and you can read more about it here.Section 67A and Section 67B are also worthy of mention here. While the former deals with sexually explicit content, the latter deals with material depicting children in sexually explicit acts. During my research for this article, I came across a good number of stickers that can attract the applicability of these two provisions. To read more about pornography rules in India, you can check this article.The creation and transmission of certain stickers may lead to legal consequences and invite criminal action. Simultaneously, it is very challenging to trace the person who originally created an obscene/sexually explicit sticker. WhatsApp promises end-to-end encryption for its users. In this context, whether tracing the origin of a message is possible is another interesting area for exploration. While the gravity of offences remains the same, traceability surely raises a few eyebrows. At this point, one possible solution can be limiting the available stickers to the ones created by WhatsApp or its approved creators."

    "headline": "UN Initiatives to Combat CSAM",
    "data": "UN Initiatives to Combat Child Sexual Abuse Material (CSAM)In autumn 1988, law enforcement agencies from 15 countries joined hands against the Wonderland Club, an international paedophile ring. This ring consisted of a chairman, secretary, and a managing committee. To become a member, an applicant needed to supply 10,000 self-produced sexually explicit images of children. Moreover, the perpetrators used five levels of encryption to make it difficult for others to view the actual content. This joint operation is a remarkable example of how coordinated action by law enforcement agencies can result in high-impact outcomes.Laws across the globe continue to use the term child pornography to refer to sexually explicit content involving children. However, this term falls short of conveying the truly damaging nature of such content. Child sexual abuse material (CSAM) is a more appropriate term. The rise of the internet has provided paedophiles with an international stage and anonymity to facilitate their harmful behaviour. The global nature of this threat necessitates international cooperation to effectively combat it. To that end, this article discusses the initiatives taken by the UN to curb the menace of CSAM.In a 1999 conference paper, Max Taylor, then Professor of Applied Psychology at University College Cork, Ireland, defined child pornography as sexual or sexualised pictures involving children. He further provided a classification for child pornography under three heads:Erotica: This classification will include pictures that may or may not involve sexual activities or nakedness but can have sexual connotations. For instance, photos of children in swimsuits. Overly sexualised cartoons of children will also come under this classification. In most places, possession and production of such content are legal.Nudity: Pictures where children are partly or wholly naked come under this classification. However, this classification will exclude pictures of naked newborn children without the intent of sexualisation. Taylor also defined a term called covert photographs. This sub-head covers individuals taking pictures of children in ostensibly “safe” areas. Also, this will often involve professional photographers in opulent settings and is an equivalent of soft porn.Explicitly Sexual: This classification includes content showing children engaged in sexual activities, posing in a sexually explicit way, or even sexual assaults. Photoshopped images of children that are sexualised (also called pseudo images) will fall under this classification.Taylor categorised types of individuals in the child pornography ecosystem under six heads:Confirmed collector: These individuals collect CSAM on a large scale, and their content is often meticulously indexed.Confirmed producer: These individuals engage in the production of CSAM and trade/exchange content with others.Sexually omnivorous: These individuals do not have a particular interest in CSAM, but their collection includes children in odd sexualised activities.Sexually curious: These individuals access a small amount of content to satisfy their curiosity. However, they can get more involved in later stages.The libertarian: The libertarians assert their right to free access to content on the internet, including CSAM.The Entrepreneur: These individuals develop websites, platforms, applications, etc., for the distribution and proliferation of CSAM. Their involvement may extend to the broader sex industry.This conference was an initiative of the foreign ministries of the US and Austria. These countries played an essential role in the discussion as the US and Europe accounted for most internet users in 1999. This conference also saw participation from internet service providers and non-governmental organisations. Therefore, the organisers hoped that the conference would educate the masses and rally public opinion on the evil of paedophilia on the internet.Primary ObjectivesBuilding better cooperation between law enforcement agencies and the judiciary.Formulating model codes of conduct among internet service providers.Creating hotlines for citizens to report child pornography or existing networks.RecommendationsCountries should adopt a zero-tolerance mechanism against child pornography, backed by a strong law and effective implementation.The conference stressed the importance of global partnerships in the awareness and empowerment of internet users.Child pornography must be criminalised across the globe, and there is a need to strengthen national law enforcement agencies and have better cross-border cooperation.Governments and ISPs should join hands to define a code of conduct concerning data preservation, reporting obligations, filtering, rating systems, and self-regulation.In addition, governments, NGOs, and industry leaders should establish hotlines for reporting content.It is also possible to create a digitised central library of content.Stakeholders should organise training programmes for personnel involved in child development and child rights issues.UNICEF organised the Rio de Janeiro Declaration and Call for Action to Prevent and Stop Sexual Exploitation of Children and Adolescents in 2008 with support from the Brazilian government and other stakeholders. Over 137 countries participated in this conference, including civil society organisations, academic institutions, and private sector companies. The preamble to the Rio de Janeiro Declaration specifically expresses concern about the increasing instances of sexual abuse of children on the internet. Moreover, the Declaration emphasises the role of public-private partnerships and encourages private sector companies to engage in efforts to stop the sexual exploitation of children. This Declaration also urged countries to establish independent institutions for child rights by 2013.RecommendationsUndertaking actions to trace and stop the flow of financial transactions related to child pornography.Supporting the efforts to address the demand for sexual exploitation of children in prostitution.Preventing the production and dissemination of child pornography, including virtual images and sexually exploitative representation of children.Strengthening the services for children victims and their families, including the establishment of accessible telephone or web-based helplinesProviding support for educational and awareness-raising campaigns for children, parents, teachers, youth organisations, and other stakeholders.Preventing the use of the internet and other emerging technologies for grooming children into online and offline abuseMaintaining a common list of websites under InterpolRecognising child pornography as a criminal offenceChild Helpline International (CHI), in association with UNICEF, implemented the LEAP project to tackle the online sexual exploitation of children. LEAP stands for Leadership in Empowering and Activating Child Helplines to Protect Children Online. CHI is a partner of the WeProtect Global Alliance, backed by the UK government, the European Commission, and the US Department of Justice. In the LEAP project, CHI reviews existing helplines and strengthens them to fight CSAM distribution online.In 2019, ILO, UNICEF, and UN.GIFT launched a training manual for fighting the trafficking of children for labour, sexual, and other forms of exploitation. It is a comprehensive guide for personnel involved in preventive, detective, and corrective actions pertaining to the exploitation of children.The reports from the 1999 Conference almost sound as if they were written for today’s India and, by an extension, the world. We continue to face the same problems but more pronounced and on a broader scale. Since international law does not have more than persuasive value in most jurisdictions, countries need to step up and strengthen their domestic laws with practical implementation.UN’s role is crucial in encouraging international cooperation, especially among law enforcement agencies. This international cooperation is essential in the context of CSAM, given the boundary-less nature of the internet. However, we must consider that there is a double-speak of sorts here. Most reports are made from a largely first-world (read western) point of view. This problem was apparent at the Vienna Conference, where the discussion revolved around the issue of child pornography in Japan and Russia. Surprisingly, these two countries did not even attend the conference. Considering the participation in Rio de Janeiro in 2008, there is hope that the involvement of governments and other stakeholders will continue to improve.Akshita Rohatgi, an undergraduate student of the University School of Law and Legal Studies, GGSIPU, worked on this article during her internship with The Cyber Blog India in January/February 2021.Featured Image Credits: Hacker background vector created by rawpixel.com – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Cyber Security and Banks: What, Why, and How?",
    "data": "Cyber Security and Banks: What, Why, and How?India’s banking sector has grown rapidly over the past few years. According to the predictions, it is going to follow the same pattern in the future. As per 2020 estimates, the number of ATMs in India is 2.10 lakhs, which may go over 4.07 lakhs by the end of this year. When we talk about cyber security, we understand it as a process of keeping an IT system safe from unauthorised access, damage, or attacks. Considering the banking sector’s role in the Indian economy, banks cannot afford to adopt a lazy attitude towards the security of their systems. As the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. A bank’s most important responsibility is to ensure that their customer’s personal and confidential information remains safe and secure.Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 provides for compensation when a body corporate fails to protect sensitive personal data. Body corporates shall ensure that they follow reasonable security practices. The term body corporate includes an association of individuals engaged in commercial or professional activities. The banking institutions directly fall within the ambit of this provision. Rule 3 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as the 2011 Rules), define sensitive personal data. Section 43A provides civil compensation in cases where body corporates fail to protect individuals’ sensitive personal data.The 2011 Rules is a good starting point for banks to implement reasonable security practices. According to Rule 8, a bank’s cyber security measures should include:A comprehensively documented information security programme. This programme should define operational, managerial, and technical controls, along with the bank’s incident response strategy. A bank should also document how they are implementing various security controls.Compliance with an internationally recognised standard such as ISO 27001:2013. This ensures that a bank follows the best practices.Adopt an industry-accepted self-regulation code, duly approved by the Central Government.Apart from these measures, the sector regulator – Reserve Bank of India – has also issued various guidelines and frameworks. The Basic Cyber Security Framework for Primary (Urban) Cooperative Banks (UCBs) is one example. This framework divides UCBs into different levels as per their digital depth and interconnectedness to the payment landscape. It then provides a baseline for each level that a bank must meet. Highlights of this framework include:Training programs for employees on phishing and good security practicesReporting mechanisms for reporting unusual security incidentsNetwork segmentation to have different networks for banking operations and ATMsAccess level for employees wherein minimum access should be grantedPeriodic vulnerability assessments and penetration testingWhile this framework does not prescribe any punitive actions, it is still a step in the right direction.After the government imposed lockdown, there was a sudden shift to digital payment modes. With an ever-increasing user base and transactions, cyber security for banks is of utmost relevance today. Over the course of the last 12 months, we have observed a significant increase in phishing/vishing cases being reported. At present, digital transactions account for close to 90% of the total transactions. In such a situation, banks’ inherent responsibility is to ensure that their digital ecosystems remain secure. I hope that banks remain vigilant about the security of their IT infrastructure."

    "headline": "Cyber crime and laws in Turkey: An overview",
    "data": "Cyber crime and laws in TurkeyThis is the seventh article in our series covering cyber laws of various countries. The previous article presented an overview of cyber crime and laws in Denmark. This article features Turkey, the first Middle East country in the series. Turkey stands at the 54th rank in the Human Development Index. The country has a moderate crime rate of around 39%. Just like other countries, Turkey is not alien to the menace of cyber crime.According to January 2020 estimates, Turkey has a total population of 84 million, and around 73.4% (62 million) are internet users. In other words, three out of four people have internet access in the country. The country witnessed an increase of 2.4 million internet users from 2019 to 2020. With over 77.39 million connections, 92% of the Turkish population has mobile phones. It is expected that Turkey will have 69 million internet users by the end of the year 2024. The most popular platforms include YouTube, Instagram, and WhatsApp.Part 10 of the Turkish Penal Code, 2004 discusses offences related to data processing systems.Article 243: Unlawful access to a computer system attracts imprisonment of one year or a fine. Imprisonment will vary between 6 months to 2 years if an accused deletes or alters any data through unlawful access.Article 244: Preventing any data processing system’s functioning will result in imprisonment of one to five years. Anybody who deletes, alters, corrupts, bars access to, adds new data, or sends data to someone else will be imprisoned for six months to three years. The penalty increases by half if an individual breaks into a public institution or bank’s data processing system.Article 245: This provision covers cases where an individual benefits by obtaining or retaining somebody’s bank account or credit card and allows it to be used without the account holder’s permission. It prescribes imprisonment of three to six years along with a judicial fine of up to 5000 days. It exempts the following situations:\n\nSpouse of a marriage with no decree of separation,\nDirect antecedent/descendant, adoptive parent, or adoptive child, and\nA sibling who resides at the same place.\n\nSpouse of a marriage with no decree of separation,Direct antecedent/descendant, adoptive parent, or adoptive child, andA sibling who resides at the same place.However, if an individual produces, sells, transfers, purchases, or receives a fake credit card, the imprisonment ranges from three to seven years with a judicial fine of 10,000 days. (Article 52 of this Code provides for calculating judicial fine in terms of the number of days).Based on EU GDPR, this law establishes the National Data Protection Authority and the Personal Data Protection Board in the country. It defines personal data as any information which helps in the identification of an individual. Sensitive personal data includes information about race, origin, religion, sect, health, etc. It lays down the following principles for data processing:Fair and lawful processingAccurate and up-to-date storage of dataProcessing only for specific and legal purposesCollection of relevant dataStoring personal data only for the required timeA data subject’s consent is mandatory for the collection and processing of their personal data. The law recognises certain exceptions, including instances permitted by law such as protection of life. In October 2017, Turkey published a regulation on Deletion, Destruction, or Anonymization of Personal Data. This regulation came into effect on January 01, 2018. It deals with deletion, destruction, and anonymity of personal data.Turkey has sufficiently invested in technology, which is clear from the statistics we saw at this article’s beginning. However, laws focusing on technology-facilitated crimes must evolve with time. At present, it is apparent that the country does not have a comprehensive framework for this subject-matter. It needs stringent laws to efficiently deal with cyber crimes.Our previous articles covering cyber crimes and laws in different countries: Denmark, Russia, Nepal, Japan, New Zealand and Norway.To contribute to our blog and knowledge base, write to us at contact@cyberblogindia.in and elaborate on how you can help create a safer cyber space."

    "data": "Online Dating in 2021: Cyber Safety Precautions for WomenOnline dating has become a common phenomenon, with many apps and their ever-increasing user base. This new trend may turn out to be unsafe for various users. The solution is not to completely stop using them, but to ensure that you use them safely. It is not a hidden fact that men and women experience cyber crime differently. More so, women are more likely to face cyber stalking and online harassment than men. This article suggests a list of cyber safety practices for women that you must follow.From what we have seen in the cases we receive, the reasons for women being the primary victims can be:Lack of awareness of using dating platforms.Negligible interest in knowing about security measures.Perpetrators may find it easy to blackmail a victim for being present on online dating sites due to cultural stigma.Lack of familiarity with technological advancements.After taking a detailed look at the available cases, I have prepared the following guide. You can adopt the following security and safety measures while using online dating platforms.You should not use a profile picture that reveals your city or locality. If a dating application shows individuals living nearby, it may be possible for them to determine your location easily.Avoid uploading so-many of your photos on your dating account. A perpetrator can perform a reverse search on your pictures to gather plenty of information about you.You should not publicly share information about your political interest. I have seen cases where a victim’s political interest was a trigger for anger or vengeful behaviour.Minimise sharing personal information that is very specific to you – for example, your height, weight, and other physical characteristics. A perpetrator can use these pieces of information with your photos to make a fake profile and give it credibility.Perpetrators often share too much personal information about themselves to build trust. In most of the cases, it is fake. So, you should not fall right into this trap and avoid sharing sensitive information just because the other person is doing so. Perpetrators use this as a tactic to extract information from you.I have seen cases where perpetrators invest around 3 to 6 months. They aim to give a false sense of safety to the victim. You should not trust someone merely because you know them for 5 months.You should avoid meeting in person without conducting a comprehensive background check.If you decide to meet the person you met online, share the meeting specifics with someone you trust.Online dating platforms can be actually useful when it comes to finding new friends or a partner. However, one must not oversee the possible dangers that may come your way. In such a situation, it becomes imperative for you to be conscious about your online safety. While the tips given above can help you greatly, always think twice before sharing your personal information on online dating platforms.

    "headline": "Cyber crime and laws in Denmark: An overview",
    "data": "Cyber crime and laws in DenmarkThis is the sixth article in our series covering cyber laws of various countries. While the previous article presented an overview of cyber crime and laws in Russia, this article focuses on Denmark. Denmark is a Nordic country which ranks 10th in the Human Development Index (HDI). Denmark has been ranked the most digitised country in the European Union (EU) for two consecutive years. The country was also adjudged to be the most digitised country globally in 2018 as per the International Digital Economy and Society Index. In 2020, it was ranked 3rd among the EU member states by the Digital Economy and Security Index.  Denmark has a population of 5.83 million, as estimated in 2020, out of which 5.54 million are active internet users. This number has seen a rise of 230,000 since 2018. It is further expected to rise to a high of 5.73 million by 2024. Factors such as a technologically proficient population, wide-ranging digitisation of public services, and businesses implementing new technology at a fast pace have led Denmark to be labelled as one of the most digital countries across the world. In 2018, Denmark was 2nd among the Nordic countries with 4.1 million social media users. A survey found Facebook to be the most used social media site by the residents. Approximately 77% of women and 68% of men use Facebook daily in Denmark.The Constitution of Denmark, 1953, under Section 72, safeguards the right to privacy. Under this section, no breach of privacy can occur in postal, telegraph, and telephone matters, except by court order, or if authorised by a statute.The General Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as GDPR, is a European Union law. It is directly applicable in Denmark since it is a Member State of the EU. The Danish Government had enacted the Danish Act on Data Protection, 2018 to implement the GDPR, which repealed the earlier Danish Act on Processing of Personal Data, 2000. However, this Data Protection Act is not applicable in Greenland and the Faroe Islands. The definitions given under the GDPR and the 2018 Act are in agreement with each other.GDPR defines personal data under Article 4(1) as any information that helps identify an individual, such as name, location details, physical, economic, cultural factors, etc. The individual to whom the data pertains is known as the data subject. Article 4(2) defines processing as performing any operation on the data, such as storing, collecting, organising, recording, etc.Article 5 lays down certain principles for the processing of personal data:Lawfulness, transparency, and fairness in processing personal data.The organisation should only use personal data for the intended use.The organisation should only collect relevant and necessary data.Data has to be accurate at all times.The organisation should securely store data.Processing shall ensure confidentiality and integrityWhen an organisation collects personal data from a data subject, they should disclose the following information (Article 13):Information about the data controllerData Protection Officer (DPO) detailsPurpose and legal basis for processingRecipients of dataTime duration for which the controller will store dataRights of a data subjectRestriction on processing of personal dataHowever, these requirements are not applicable if public interest exceeds the data subject’s interest.Under GDPR, a data subject has the following rights:Right to access (Article 15)Right to rectify (Article 16)Right to erasure (Article 17)Right to restrict processing (Article 18)Right to data portability (Article 20)Right to object (Article 21)The Danish Criminal Code or the Danish Penal Code contains the following provisions related to cyber crimes:Anybody who unlawfully disturbs public mail services, publicly used telegraph and telephone services, radio/television installations, and information systems will be imprisoned for a maximum of six years or shall pay a fine. (Section 193)Anyone found selling obscene pictures or objects to a person below 16 years shall be liable to a fine. (Section 234)Dissemination of obscene photographs, films, other visual reproductions to individuals below 18 years of age shall attract imprisonment of 2 years or a fine. In aggravating circumstances, where a child’s life is endangered or is seriously harmed, or gross violence is used, the imprisonment shall increase to 6 years. (Section 235)Unlawful access to information that is meant to be used for data processing shall be punishable with imprisonment of up to 1.5 years or a fine. (Section 263)Denmark has maintained its position of being one of the most digitised countries for the last few years. Besides, the implementation of the GDPR has proved to be beneficial for the country. If Denmark continues to implement the above-mentioned laws efficaciously and introduces new provisions as per the changing requirements, it can control the ever-increasing rate of cyber crimes. Individuals can report cyber-related sex crimes and crimes against digital devices in Denmark here.Our previous articles covering cyber crimes and laws in different countries: Russia, Nepal, Japan, New Zealand and Norway.To contribute to our blog and knowledge base, write to us at contact@cyberblogindia.in and elaborate on how you can help create a safer cyber space.Featured Image Credits: Image by WikiImages from Pixabay"

    "headline": "Can minors use online dating applications?",
    "data": "Can minors use dating applications?Online dating has become a common part of day-to-day lives. Some may use a dating app for finding a suitable partner; while others are simply looking for friends. However, should online dating platforms be available for everyone to use, including minors? This is the debate that the article seeks to engage with. Dating applications seem convenient on the surface but can turn out to be very dangerous. Minors may think that this form of association is harmless since no one is meeting in person, but sharing personal information with strangers can be harmful. We are aware of numerous instances where minors created fake accounts on dating applications, and the end result was indeed disastrous.Ideally, minors cannot create accounts on dating applications, as most of these apps have a minimum age criterion of 18 years. However, minors often enter the wrong age to create their account on a dating application.Various dating applications ask their users to share their location. This location is an indication of the proximity with the person you match with on a dating application. Using other publicly available information about a user, I do not believe it will be difficult for a perpetrator to determine the exact location.Consider this example: Mr X has been living in the same colony that he was born. He matches with a user who is 25 years old. In reality, this user is Ms B, who is only 17 years old. The pictures and how a minor is involved in a conversation may easily give away the age, even though they are posing to be over 18+. Over time, if Ms B shares her picture or any personal information about her, Mr X can locate their home. Mr X may casually ask where she lives, and she can tell the name of the apartment. Every apartment complex has a board with the names of all the flat owners. Using this information, Mr X can go to Ms B’s apartment without any invitation whatsoever.Dating applications ask for various types of personal information, including your height, gender, political beliefs, ethnicity, salary, etc. Well, they need this information to find the best suitable match for you. If you have used dating application previously, you already know that this information will be accessible for any user who visits your profile. I can quickly take screenshots of your pictures and create a fake account. When the application asks me personal details, I will use your height, gender, political beliefs, and ethnicity information which was already there.Using this fake account, I can talk to any person I wish to, and you would have no idea. This is precisely identity theft. While adults may be able to catch this misrepresentation, minors tend to be more gullible on this front. Moreover, they can also open up and share plenty of sensitive information about them and their family with fake accounts. At this point, I believe I do not need to say that this can have dangerous consequences.Sexting is gradually becoming common practice for all age groups. Once you send a picture from your device, the receiver also has a copy of your photo/video. While you have total control over files on your phone, the same does not hold true for the receiver’s phone. The receiver may make multiple copies of your photos, share them on WhatsApp groups, or upload on any site that they wish to. From what we have seen over the years, minors have a tendency to easily trust the person they meet online. When they try to get out of a relationship, the other party starts blackmailing them and asking for unwanted sexual favours. In some cases, the perpetrators even demand money for not uploading those pictures and videos. If you are going through something like this, do not be afraid to seek help. The law is on your side!The tendency to easily trust the other person often results in turning a blind eye to red signals. The other person can send phishing links and ask the minor to make a small payment. The perpetrator captures the payment details, which leads to substantial financial losses.When you sign up on any online platform, you accept their terms and conditions. This acceptance means that you are entering into a contract with the said platform. As per Indian laws, an individual must be 18 years of age to enter into a contract. You can read more about minimum age requirements in India here. It is quite straight forward to conclude from the cases discussed above that minors should steer clear of online dating platforms. Situations can actually get much worse in real life. We have come across cases where online dating platforms led to rape, murder, molestation, and sexual assault of minors. On a precautionary note,Minors should prioritise their safety over being cool.With inputs from Raj Pagariya.To contribute to our blog and knowledge base, write to us at contact@cyberblogindia.in and elaborate on how you can help us create a safer cyber space.Featured Image Credits: People vector created by pikisuperstar – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Are matrimonial websites safe to use?",
    "data": "Are matrimonial websites safe to use?The use of matrimonial websites has grown over the past few years. During the lockdown, a leading Indian matrimonial platform observed a 30% increase in the number of average daily registrations. Increased usage makes such sites more prone to cyber crimes, as has been reported in the recent past. Yet, there is no definite answer to the question of whether these websites are safe for finding a life partner. This article analyses the kinds of cases that we come across regularly and suggests measures to avoid unpleasant situations.Before getting into the kinds of cyber crimes and frauds taking place on such sites, I will be elaborating on why these crimes occur in the first place.The phrase think before you talk may be extended to think before you type. Most people forget the repercussions of what they type. For example, we are generally secretive about details such as salary, financial assets, etc., but, when it comes to finding a partner online, we put all our details on display. While one may think that this increases our credibility; it also increases the chances a perpetrator missing your personal information. Most people think that money is a major factor in finding a partner, but one must be careful about putting out one’s profile on public platforms.Love may be blind, but it need not be deaf and dumb as well. Finding love online these days means that physical verification is not possible. We tend to ignore subtle red flags in online meetings, and people turn a blind eye to things they would have otherwise found suspicious. It is important to treat people who one meets through such websites in the same way as one would have if meeting in person.Most people who register themselves on matrimonial websites want to settle down or find a perfect match. This makes them vulnerable and easier targets for cyber crimes.Perpetrators establish a sense of trust by investing time in the people they meet online. They may talk to the victim for even 3 to 6 months just to establish a sense of trust and make them more vulnerable. They also spend time talking to the victim’s family or friends to create an impression and gain the victim’s trust. The perpetrators also claim to belong to well-accepted professionals, such as doctors, lawyers, businessmen, etc. to establish a sense of social security and trust.As per a news article published in October 2019, a woman, a resident of Bavdhan, working in an IT Sector in Pune lost 10 lakh rupees due to a matrimonial fraud. The incident occurred in the first two weeks of September 2019. The conman claimed to have sent the techie gifts from the Netherlands which were seized by customs officials at New Delhi. These gifts included a ring, perfumes, a high-end laptop, and many more such things. She then got a phone call from the customs office asking her to send money to release the above-mentioned gifts.The official also mentioned that this amount was refundable, and the woman was made to send money to eight different bank accounts. After transferring the money she realised that she had been duped as the conman who claimed to be an NRI stopped responding to her calls and messages. She even found out that there was no seizure of goods at the New Delhi customs office, and the call that she got from the customs officer was fake. She lodged a complaint at the Hadapsar police station on December 28, 2019.A similar case occurred recently in July 2020 in Goa, where a woman was duped on a matrimonial site and the imposter duped her of 35 lakh rupees on the pretext of custom clearance.In another case reported by the Times of India in June 2020, a 33-year-old Software Engineer in Hyderabad was allegedly duped of Rs 1 crore by a woman he met online through a matrimonial website in 2018. The fraudster introduced herself as a doctor of Indian origin who was residing in Baltimore. The software professional was so smitten by the woman and the chats they had on Telegram and WhatsApp that he was ready to pay any amount of money that she asked for. The victim’s monthly salary was about Rs 80,000 and he utilised savings along with borrowing to send her the money. The KPHB police station registered a case under Sections 420 and 406 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Earlier in March 2020, the Hyderabad police arrested a gang of four individuals comprising of a Nigerian and three Nepalese nationals. These scammers tricked a doctor into transferring seven lakh rupees in their bank accounts. This was under the pretext for GST and custom clearance payments for gifts and jewellery.In April 2020, one victim got in touch with us for seeking assistance in a case involving sexual harassment and extortion. According to her, she signed up on a popular matrimonial website and started exploring the platform. One individual, claimed to be a Navratna PSU employee and posted to a European country, contacted her. Over time, he shared many fake pieces of information to gain her trust. These included employee ID cards, GPS locations, and salary receipts. A couple of months, he asked her to send her nude photos. While she initially sent the pictures, she came to know that he was also screen-recording their calls. When she informed him that her parents had fixed her engagement, he started blackmailing her using those pictures and screen-recorded videos.Since then to the time of publication of this article, we have received 17 cases with similar modus operandi.According to Section 66C of the Information Technology Act, 2000, it is an incident of identity theft when someone fraudulently or dishonestly uses your electronic signature, password, or any other unique identification feature. Other provisions that may be applicable vary from case to case. Relevant provisions from the Indian Penal Code, 1860:Section 464: ForgerySection 465: False documentsSection 468: Forgery for the purpose of cheatingSection 469: Forgery for harming reputationSection 471: Using a forged document or electronic record as genuineSection 474: Possession of a forged document with an intention to use as genuineFinancial frauds on matrimonial websites are punishable by law. They may involve the application of Sections 66C and 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000. However, relevant provisions from the Indian Penal Code, 1860 are applicable such as Sections 406 and 420.While the exact provisions will vary from one case to another, the following provisions from the Information Technology Act, 2000 are relevant.Section 66E: Violation of privacySection 67: Publication and transmission of obscene contentSection 67A: Publication and transmission of sexually explicit contentWhile on the other hand, Sections 354C (voyeurism), 354D (stalking), and 384 to 387 (extortion) from the Indian Penal Code, 1860 are applicable.Every platform out there will have its pros and cons and the same goes for matrimonial websites. It becomes your responsibility to ensure that you perform due diligence for any individual that you meet online.As a thumb rule, you should not trust any person you meet online. If you do trust, ALWAYS verify.We recommend our readers to follow these best practices to minimise the chances of falling prey to cyber crimes:Do an extensive background check on the other person before revealing your personal information.Do not believe everything that the other person says.Take your time and make an informed decision.Talk to your friend or family members as they will have a fresh pair of eyes.Do not share your financial information, or make any payments for any reason whatsoever.With inputs from Raj Pagariya.For contributing to our blog and knowledge base, write to us at contact@cyberblogindia.in and elaborate on how you can help us in creating a safer cyber space.Featured Image Credits: People vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Cyber crime and laws in Russia: An overview",
    "data": "Cyber crime and laws in RussiaContinuing with the series of articles covering cyber laws of various countries, this is our fifth article. The previous articles have covered cyber crime and laws in Nepal, Japan, New Zealand and Norway. This article presents an overview of cyber crimes and relevant laws in Russia. The country has been ranked 52nd in the Human Development Index. The country has a crime rate of 1380 offences per 100,000 population. Russia was considered a technologically advanced country earlier but has not been able to keep up with technological advancement. The following sections throw light on the existing situation and Russia’s existing legal framework.Russia has the eighth-largest population in the world that can access the internet. There are 70 million active social media users in the country. Internet usage has increased due to the outbreak of Covid-19. It compelled most of the population to switch from traditional methods to online methods. According to Sberbank, a Russian bank, the country might lose close to $45 billion in 2020 due to cyber crimes. They have further estimated that the extent of loss in 2021 would be twice of that in 2020. ATM card-related crimes have increased by 500%, as per Sberbank.Chapter 28 of the Code contains crimes in the sphere of Computer Information. The number of crimes under this head has increased every year.Article 272 talks about illegal access to computer information that is legally protected, and prescribes punishment for the same. Computer information means any message or data which is presented in electronic form. The punishment is fine of 200 to 500 minimum wages, or two to five months salary, or corrective labour for 6 to 12 months, or deprivation of liberty for up to 2 years.Article 273 talks about creating, disseminating, and using harmful computer programs through a computer for ill-intended usage. The punishment is 200 to 500 minimum wages, or two to five months salary, or deprivation of liberty for up to 3 years. In cases where the consequences are grave, this duration may extend up to 7 years.Article 274 talks about the violation of the rules of operation of computers, computer systems, and networks. It also provides punishment for the same. The punishment is disqualification from holding specific officers for up to five years, or compulsory works for 180 to 240 hours, or restraint of liberty for up to 2 years. In cases where the consequences are grave, this duration may extend up to 4 years.The Constitution of Russia has provided for the right to privacy for individuals since 1993. People have a right to keep their communications secret. A competent court’s order may restrict an individual’s right to privacy. Nobody can access someone else’s personal data without their consent.The Federal Law on Personal Data covers everything that relates to data protection of individuals. It defines personal data as any information by which a person can be recognised easily. For example, first name, surname, address, education, profession, etc. It lays down conditions under which entities can collect and process personal data. Consent of personal data holder is necessary before processing their personal data. Even after granting the consent, the personal data holder can revoke this consent anytime. The processing will have to stop once the personal data holder revokes their consent. After receiving a revocation request, the entity shall destroy the personal data within three days. Also, once the objective of obtaining personal data is completed, it has to be destroyed.A personal data holder has the following rights under this law:Right to access information about the processed data;Right to ask for the ceasing of the processing when personal data is inadequate or the processer obtained it illegally; andRight to ask for the immediate ceasing of data in case of direct marketing.This law recognises four categories of personal data:Public: Personal data which is already available in the public domain.Biometric: The physiological and biological traits which reveal the identity of a person come under biometric data.Special: This data is specific to race, origin, religion, heath, etc.Other: Any data which does not fall under the above three comes under this typeRussia requires more stringent and specific laws for technology-facilitated crimes. A thorough reading of publicly available information is sufficient to understand Russia’s track record on internet censorship and the right to privacy. In a continuously evolving cyber space, it is ideal to hope that the existing situation improves considerably.For contributing to our blog and knowledge base, write to us at contact@cyberblogindia.in and elaborate on how you can help us in creating a safer cyber space."

    "headline": "Cyber crime and laws in Nepal: An overview",
    "data": "Cyber crime and laws in NepalThis is the fourth article in the series covering cyber laws of various countries. The previous articles have covered countries such as Japan, New Zealand and Norway. This article offers an overview of cyber crime and laws in Nepal. Nepal has been ranked 147th in the Human Development Index. The rate of crime in Nepal has been high, and cyber crime has especially seen increased occurrence. During the ongoing pandemic, the number of cyber crime cases in Nepal has increased, despite the fact that the disease has not affected the country much.There are a total of 10.21 million people in Nepal who used the internet in 2020. The number of users increased by 315,000 between 2019 and 2020. Around 10 million people in Nepal use social media. It appears that the country’s citizens have been reluctant to report cyber crime, with only 53 cases being registered in 2017. However, 2018 saw a sharp rise in the number of cases to 132. In 2018 and 2019, a total of 180 cases were registered. Out of these 180, 125 cases were from the capital city, Kathmandu and the rest from others.This was Nepal’s first cyber law. Cyber crimes were dealt with under the Country’s criminal code before this law came into force. Since the cases of cyber crime increased, it became necessary to enact a separate law. Chapter 9 of the Act deals with offences relating to computers, the main highlights of which are as follows:Pirating or destroying any computer system intentionally without authority carries imprisonment for three years, or a fine of two hundred thousand rupees, or both.Accessing any computer system without authority results in imprisonment for three years, or a fine of two hundred thousand rupees, or both.Intentional damage to or deleting data from a computer system carries imprisonment for three years, or a fine of two hundred thousand rupees, or both.Publication of illegal material in electronic form carries imprisonment for 5 years, or a fine of one hundred thousand rupees, or both.Commission of a computer fraud carries imprisonment for two years, or a fine of one hundred thousand rupees, or both.The aim of this Act is to protect and uphold the rights of children. It also prohibits child pornography. Section 16(2) of the Act prohibits individuals from capturing any immoral picture of a child. Section 16(3) of the Act prohibits publication and distribution of any such photographs of children.This act protects the copyright of ideas, including a computer program. It prohibits people from copying and modifying the original work of others, and using it for their own advantage or economic benefits.This act is the first legislation in Nepal to protect the right to privacy of its people, and define personal information. It protects the privacy of body, family life, residence, property, and communication. It puts the responsibility on public entities to protect the personal data of individuals. They cannot transfer such data to anyone without the consent of the owner. The Act prescribes a general punishment for violation of privacy as three years of imprisonment, or a fine of NPR 30,000, or both.All the above laws that Nepal has promulgated for cyber crimes are yet not enough. The country needs to address loopholes in these laws and encourage its citizens to report cyber crime incidents. There is also a need for comprehensive laws on e-commerce, social media, and cyber terrorism, among other spheres of cyber space. Another requirement is that of a clear definition of child pornography. A dedicated cyber crime cell is also a need of the hour. Nepal needs to work further on its cyber laws to survive in this technologically advanced world."

    "headline": "Personhood of autonomous systems: Kant’s concept of autonomy",
    "data": "In the first article of this series, we briefly explored autonomy from various perspectives such as legal, technological, and philosophical. It lays down the groundwork for our discussions to follow in the upcoming articles of this series on the personhood of autonomous systems. This article is an attempt to understand Kant’s concept of autonomy in the context of autonomous systems. In the words of Kant himself,“Autonomy of the will is the sole principle of all moral laws, and of all duties which confirm to them.”Kant defines free actions as per the will of an agent. This definition brings a natural distinction between spontaneous and unrestrained actions of an agent (Kant, 2017). According to him, autonomy plays a vital role in the biographies of individuals, public policy, political ideologies, and moral responsibilities. Autonomy is not liberation from legislation, rather the freedom to be enslaved. Autonomy is the basis of Kant’s views on logical reasoning and is closely associated with morality (Korsgaard, 1996).Foundation of moral responsibility and mutual respect relies on the self-infliction of global legislations related to morality. Kant believes that freedom is extrinsic to our decisions or will. The self-infliction of such legislations based on morality is what he terms as autonomy. He strongly believed that autonomy is crucial to fathom the control of morality on individuals (Hill, 1989). Or in other words, autonomy lies at the core of the theory of morality. Autonomy involves the imposition of legislations upon ourselves and their conclusive authority upon us.The logical decision theory states that a will functions by acknowledging the reasons. A will operated by the function of natural laws cannot be construed to be functioning by acknowledging the logical reasons. Kant has focussed more on the autonomy of will, instead of personal autonomy. The autonomy of will motivates individuals to make and accept principles, essentially resulting in exclusive and broader freedom of society (Wood, 2007).Core Elements of Kantian Ethics (Adopted from Ulgen (2017))Commentators like Anscombe have labelled Kant’s theory as absurd. She claims that Kant’s theory necessitates higher authority for lawmakers. She states that the law has binding power, and it can make individuals comply even if they are resistant to do a certain act (Anscombe, 1981). According to her, Kant does not comprehend the ideology of compliance, and hence, his theory is completely irrational (Wilson, 2009).On the other hand, Tyler believes that legislations are conformed by the citizens, not just out of fear but out of respect. He supported Kant’s theory by contending that his concept of morality is an analogy demonstrating a version of ourselves (Tyler, 2006).Similarly, Allison redeems the logical explanation of Kant and believes that Kant respects the principles of logical reasoning. An agent with absolute freedom can act and think logically for any purpose that surpasses their belief for working for their contentment only. Allison believes that the idea of everyone acting similarly is instrumental in the justification of Kant’s interpretation (Allison, 1986).Kant has argued that logic is the only touchstone that accords autonomy status to human beings. It is reasonable to presume that he would hold a similar view of autonomous systems. If Kant’s principles are followed, the autonomy of machines can be established theoretically. From his perspective, the logical understanding of human beings is connected to capability; instead of real control of logics (Simon, 1982). Technologies present in autonomous systems can be presumed to develop rationality, provided they indulge in logical reasoning and take subsequent actions.Kant gives more importance to the rational capacity of human beings; instead of possessing rationality. He also takes into account the deficiency of morality and immoral content; where humans may irrationally for gaining an advantage over their opponent (White, 2018). Even though Kant’s concept is specifically reserved for human beings and their capability to set up a system for governing moral conduct, artificial intelligence as a technology may have this potential; instead of actual human rational thinking (Smithers, 1997). This approach sounds promising; but at the same time, it raises concerns about certainty and predictability of technology in real-world scenarios.When it boils down to machines vs. humans, there is a clear distinction between machine’s logic and human wisdom.Machines may outperform human beings in a certain set of tasks due to faster processing of data. However, they lack deliberation and sentiments which are necessary for human reasoning in situations where autonomous systems are supposed to take over. Further, they lack the complex cognitive ability present in humans to appraise an ongoing situation, exercise judgement, take a certain action, refrain from an exaggerated action, or limit harm to other parties (Lieblich & Benvenisti, 2016). Autonomous systems do not have an inherent ability to stop a particular action at the last minute or lookout for a workable alternative like human beings.At the end of the day, Kant would be concerned about the certainty and uniformity of such machines in real-life situations. Without a doubt, machines can perform faster peripheral processing based on calculative analysis, data classification, and well-defined actions. In mechanical logics, machines might surpass human beings. However, they would be devoid of consciousness and contemplative approach of human logic. For example, human judgement plays a crucial role in wars to avoid incessant damage and take appropriate measures after assessing the gravity of an ongoing situation. Robots, or autonomous systems in general, are do not have psychological capabilities to examine and execute decisions in critical situations. Autonomous systems do not have impulsive capabilities to backtrack their actions at the last moment. Hence, we need a more lucid perspective to understand the logical aspects of such systems and their applications.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Personhood of autonomous systems: What is autonomy?",
    "data": "Over the course of the last couple of years, a majority of the research work that I have taken up has been focused on autonomous systems. While there is still plenty of existing literature that I have not explored, I will be summarising my learnings in this series of articles titled “Personhood of autonomous systems.” Before we jump the wagon to talk about artificial intelligence (AI) or autonomous systems and try to define them as systems capable of making decisions on their own or interpret technological terms into legal sense or vice versa, one must consider how the legal jurisprudence has evolved on the subject of autonomy.Traditionally, the law has attributed personhood and autonomy to human beings by default (Laukyte, 2012). However, with non-human entities coming into the picture, these attributes are also assigned to companies, states, municipalities, deities, trusts, NGOs, etc. in some form or other. For human beings like you and me, legal personhood and individual autonomy will be closely intertwined. Once you attain the age of majority, you will achieve full autonomy while at the same time, the law will recognise you as a person with certain rights and duties.Back in the eighteenth century, Kant introduced a revolutionary concept of his time – morality. In his words,“Autonomy of the will is the sole principle of all moral laws, and of all duties which confirm to them.”He called morality as a mechanism of self-governance and strongly believed that autonomy lies in an individual’s will (Kant, 2007). This means that for an individual to be recognised as a moral agent, he shall either be an autonomous or self-governing creature. According to Kant’s theory, autonomy can be a compass to specify what is consistent with duty and what is not (i.e., common human reason). The common human reason, also referred to as pure practical reason, belongs to human beings at large. Kant believed that one can’t lose moral capacities, irrespective of how corrupt they become (Schneewind, 1998).Philosophically, autonomy is related to morality, will, and freedom. It is safe to presume that these three attributes exist in human beings. However, this presumption or understanding of autonomy gives rise to an interesting question:How can artificial agents become autonomous with these three attributes?As far as morality is concerned, we have seen time and again that artificial agents can take part in situations involving moral reasoning, either as an entity or agent (Indurkhya, 2019). At the same time, there are a good number of arguments that suggest that for artificial systems to be considered moral, they must be equipped with a certain level of cognitive knowledge so that they can access and analyse the effects and consequences of their prospective actions on human beings and act accordingly. This can be possibly achieved via three approaches (Allen et al., 2000):Directly programming moral values into the agent;Implementing associate learning models to make agents moral; andSimulating and evolving agents using the iterative prisoner’s dilemma (PD) game.The first approach is bound to be problematic as moral values are highly subjective in nature. They may have different meanings for different individuals. So, for a team of human beings to sit down and decide on a set of values to guide artificial agents, may not be an efficient solution (Hemment et al., 2019). The second approach is derived from how children learn to distinguish between right or wrong, i.e., morally acceptable or not. A child’s learning is influenced by various factors such as parents’ approval, avoiding punishment, and acceptance by other children. Nevertheless, we also need to consider that artificial agents can have motives for their actions, just like children do (Arsiwalla et al., 2019).In the third approach, iterative PD is suggested over simple PD and it differs from how a game of simple PD is played. In iterative PD, players do not know how many times they will play the game. However, they remember their previous actions. These previous actions drive their decision-making process and future strategy (Dennis & Slavkovik, 2018). A good criticism of this approach is that morality is substantially more complex than what a game of PD may account for.It is also a matter of discussion as to whether artificial agents can conceptualise morality. Humans do have this ability, but whether the existing computer science technologies can achieve the same level of conceptualisation is a debatable topic. For human beings, personal relationships, upbringing, dignity, self-respect, people skills, and commitments are some of the qualities that affect morality (Coleman & Arete, 2001). As per the existing research, it is reasonable to construe that implementing these qualities through algorithms is still a theoretical concept. At this point in time, it appears to be a strenuously complex task for computer science engineering to design, model, and develop autonomy in a sense elaborated by Kant.Autonomy in the computer science domain is loosely related to fields such as artificial intelligence and robotics. There is neither a clear distinction between autonomy and non-autonomy, nor there is a recognisable pattern in different use cases (Smithers, 1997). Similar to Kant’s theory of autonomy, autonomy in computer science remains a subjective concern. What is autonomous for one computer scientist may not be for another (Covrigrand & Lindsay, 1991). However, as a matter of general practice, the term autonomous is used for devices or systems having some sort of independent control or intelligence. However, none of those devices or systems can be fully considered as autonomous. On this debate, there is a general agreement in the computer science community that an artificial agent can be considered as autonomous if (Allen et al., 2000):It can learn from its experiences and act accordingly in the future.It continues to do so over a long course of time.It does so without any intervention or direct control by human beings or any other agents.The first feature entails an agent’s capability to modify and rewrite its programmed functions and develop new functions as required (Scherer, 2015). Accordingly, with continued modifications and additions, the degree of autonomy keeps on increasing (Bakey, 1998). The second feature deals with an agent’s ability to act autonomously in a given environment over a certain time period. Here, there is no temporary limit for autonomy, and necessarily, mere execution of all the programmed functions and repeating the same set of actions over and again are not sufficient to be deemed autonomous (Hopgood, 2001). The third feature identifies an agent’s ability to perform the required actions without human intervention. Hence, it must be able to define its internal states and control its actions (Sycara, 1998; Asaro, 2016).Autonomy for artificial agents can be understood in two senses: strong and weak. An agent has strong autonomy when it does not only choose the ways to achieve a goal but the goal itself. An agent has weak autonomy when it is only capable of choosing various alternatives to achieve a particular goal. These goals are predefined and predetermined by human beings or other agents (Calverley, 2008). An ideal autonomous entity must be able to shape its life and determine its course appropriately. For this to happen, an artificial agent must have strong autonomy as it would be quintessential for the recognition of legal personhood.Once an autonomous system is recognised as a legal person, it becomes subject to all the existing laws and regulations, just like us. Recognition of human-like autonomy for autonomous systems will impose certain restrictions while at the same time, granting a set of rights and corresponding duties. If legal personhood is ascribed to autonomous systems, they will become a part of the classes of legal persons, and we will have a plethora of legal issues to deal with. In the upcoming parts, I will be writing about whether we can accommodate autonomous systems in our existing legal framework. If not, how can we regulate this new class of persons?Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "UNICEF Industry Toolkit for Children’s Online Privacy and Freedom of Expression",
    "data": "UNICEF Industry Toolkit for Children’s Online Privacy and Freedom of ExpressionIn our last few articles, we have made an attempt to explore laws and regulations on children’s online safety. From the UK’s age appropriate design code to parental consent and personal information in COPPA, we have also covered PDPB in the context of children’s data privacy. This article discusses a UNICEF industry toolkit on “Children’ Online Privacy and Freedom of Expression.”This 28-page document builds on UNICEF and ITU’s Guidelines for Child Online Protection (2015). It translates the principles into practical actions through checklists, questions, and recommendations.All the aspects of children’s privacy are relevant in digital space. These aspects include physical, communication, informational, and decisional facets. Technologies that track, monitor, and publish images of children directly affect their privacy. Interception of their posts, chat, or calls, irrespective of the interceptor, pose a threat to their informational privacy. We need to respect children’s privacy so that:They can securely and privately access online resources.Their personal data and communication remain protected from unauthorised access.Children’s privacy becomes a vital consideration in the design and development of websites and applications.Online platforms do not profile their users who are less than 18 years of age.To protect children’s privacy, we have to ensure that:Children’s parents/guardians provide free and informed consent for the processing of their personal data.Data processing occurs in a lawful and transparent manner.There are appropriate programs for educating, empowering, and informing children about the protection of their personal data.Children’s data is accurate and up to date. It is stored to a minimally necessary extent.The internet has vast resources for children so that they can express themselves. However, certain barriers prevent children from utilising these opportunities equally. Here itself, certain children may require assistance to understand and exercise their rights. This principle can be realised in an environment where:There is affordable and reliable access to digital technology and differences in languages, literacy levels, and capacity are accounted for.There is no disproportionate monitoring, unnecessary strict moderation, unwarranted limitations on anonymity, or policing of user-generated content by governments or parents.They can access the digital world without excessive filters.They can access information from a broad range of sources to suit their understanding and interests.Children’s information available online shapes their reputation. This also influences their interpersonal relationships and ability to access employment and services as they grow older. The stakeholders should empower children to protect their online reputation so that:They can request correction or deletion of data, especially when an online platform collects their information without their permission. They should be able to seek the removal of information that damages their reputation.Parents, guardians, media outlets, schools, and other third parties must refrain from sharing information that can undermine children’s reputation.They have sufficient digital literacy skills for making informed choices about creating and sharing personal content.Parents/guardians should assist their children in protecting their online reputation.Childhood is a continuous period of development that is highly dynamic in nature. We cannot stick to a single approach for dealing with children’s online privacy. The stakeholders have to consider the evolving capacities of children so that they can exercise their rights as they mature. In a practical sense, this translates to:Children receive appropriate assistance for understanding the terms and conditions of online platforms.Online platforms do not ask for informed consent from children when they are not capable of doing so.Parents play a proactive role in deciding the nature of content that their younger children can consume and subsequently share, while at the same time, duly incorporating children’s opinions.Parenting controls and filtering tools account for the rights and abilities of older children to make informed and empowered decisions.Children have a right to seek remedies when their rights are abused or violated. Traditionally, rights vary from one jurisdiction to another. However, the internet is boundaryless, and it can be complex to realise their rights in such an environment. The first step to this realisation is to make children aware of their rights. This should be followed by knowledge tools in terms of how they can exercise these rights. We must create an ecosystem where:The stakeholders should inform children about their rights to privacy and freedom of expression. They should be able to understand how data collection, content moderation, and filtering affect their rights.Children should know about reporting mechanisms in line with their digital literacy level, age, and maturity.The responsible organisations/authorities respond to children’s complaints without any delays.Children, as well as their parents/guardians, can report content or file complaints about covering the full ambit of their privacy and expression rights.Monitoring and surveillanceOnline profilingData collection and processingData analysis and retentionContent moderation and filteringDevice/network-level filteringData collection requirements for accessing contentProhibitions on pseudonymsRoadblocks in accessing the internet, including digital literacy and costComplaint mechanismsDigital literacySharing of children’s personal information without consentAbility to give informed consentCapacity to understand T&CsDecision-making and parental monitoringTransparent reporting of incidents that involve human rightsEducation about human rights of childrenEffective and easily accessible reporting toolsThis document further provides a checklist for companies to recognise children’s right to privacy and freedom of expression. This checklist is divided into four categories:Obtaining children’s personal dataUsing and retaining children’s personal dataEnsuring children’s access to informationEducating and informing children onlineEach of these categories contains detailed questions for online platforms. These questions will help online platforms in implementing age-appropriate practices for children. For example, one question in the checklist is: How does your website know whether the user is a child? This question enables online platforms to implement age verification mechanism. Similarly, other questions in this extensive checklist will help companies in ensuring that they follow good practices.

    "headline": "Magecart attack: All you need to know",
    "data": "Magecart attack: All you need to knowAccording to a recent Kaspersky report, India saw an increment of 37% in the number of cyber attacks in Q1 2020, as compared to Q4 2019. While the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has increased our dependence on internet-enabled services, threats have not stayed behind. In the last six months or so, many online platforms have become popular. We have also seen the emergence of new platforms for providing various services. Such platforms, typically called as e-commerce platforms, allow users to pay via cash on delivery or through different payment methods. These payment methods include UPI, wallets, debit/credit card, internet banking, etc. To make a payment using any of these methods, a user has to enter some personal information such as UPI address or card number during the payment process. This is precisely where Magecart attackers set their target.Put plainly, Magecart is a group of hackers who target online shopping carts based on the Magento system. The reason behind this is simple: carts process payment card information of customers. This type of attack is known as a supply chain attack. Attackers compromise a third-party tool whose code remains unknown to an organization’s security team. It has been in operation since 2016 and so far, it is responsible for data breaches at Ticketmaster, British Airways, Newegg, and Forbes Magazine, among others.Magecart attackers capture data using techniques such as digital skimming or form jacking. In digital skimming, attackers use third-party malicious code for collecting payment card data. Similarly, attackers inject JavaScript code to take over the functionality of a form page that collects payment data in formjacking.Generally, Magecart attackers replace the original JavaScript code with a malicious code which is very difficult to spot. They either make changes to the Magento source code or use a page redirecting mechanism to inject malware in host websites. Researchers have identified more than 40 such malicious code injections which have the potential to steal data. To spot the difference between the original code and modified code, line by line comparison is necessary. Magecart attacks are often difficult to detect as attackers inject their malicious code in scripts which are trusted by default by security tools.A RiskIQ and Flashpoint report found that at least six hacking groups that are actively involved in developing different versions of Magecart malware. Each hacking group has a distinct code and signature. Researchers observed multiple improvements introduced by attackers in this malware family. These improvements are:Magecart attackers have started to target new plug-ins, apart from Magento.Attackers are using a new method for infecting advertising banners on websites. They place Magecart code on a web server and when a user views the infected ad in their browser, the malicious code downloads on their computer.Instead of spraying malware, Magecart attackers are leveraging social engineering techniques to study their targets’ IT infrastructure.Trickmaster: Trickmaster utilized a custom-built payment module from Inbenta. Attackers were able to place malicious code in Inbenta services, and the attack remained undetected for five months. As a result of this attack, payment card details of 40,000 customers were stolen.British Airways: British Airways lost close to $230 million due to a successful Magecart attack. The attackers were able to steal payment card details of 380,000 customers. The injected code collected payment card information as soon as a user clicked on the Submit button.Forbes Magazine: Forbes Magazine collected phone numbers and addresses of subscribers, apart from payment card details. A security researcher reported that Forbes had become a victim of Magecart attackers, but detailed information was never shared.Newegg: It took five days for Newegg to spot the infected code on their website. The attackers collected payment card details of more than 500,000 customers.Shoppers Approved: Many websites use third-party widgets such as Shoppers Approved for gathering reviews and ratings. Shoppers Approved has thousands of customers that use its services. However, the investigation revealed that only a small percentage of customers were affected.Use content security policy (CSP) and sub-resource integrity (SRI) to control where scripts get loaded.Regularly audit the existing code for changes and updates.Conduct risk management for third-party widgets, applications, and tools.Closely monitor the communication of third-party tools with external domains.A successful series of Magecart attack reveals how attackers continue to target different attack vectors. Instead of weeks and months, organizations should be able to detect changes in their source code within a matter of a few seconds. It is high time that e-commerce platforms and associated service providers step-up their security measures to detect threats in real-time. Moreover, for service providers whose customer base is in thousands and millions, they cannot have a lacklustre attitude and wait for security incidents to occur. They must adopt proactive measures to ensure that security incidents are detected in real-time with minimum impact on their services.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "COPPA Compliance Checklist for Websites",
    "data": "COPPA Compliance Checklist for WebsitesThe Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (COPPA) imposes certain requirements on online service providers that seek to collect personal information of children. This article is in continuation with my previous article that elaborated COPPA’s privacy policy and parental consent requirements. In this article, I will be discussing a step-by-step procedure for online services to demonstrate COPPA compliance. With Indian Personal Data Protection Bill in the pipeline, COPPA compliance can help Indian businesses in ensuring that they are on the right path.Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has prescribed a list of six steps for complying with COPPA compliance requirements. These steps are:Check if your website or online service collects information from children below the age of 13 years.Ensure your company has a clearly visible privacy policy that fulfils COPPA compliance requirements.Ensure that your company takes parental consent before collecting any information from a child.Parental consent taken in the third step is verifiable as required by COPPA.Provide clear communication to parents regarding their rights related to their children’s data and inform the parents that they respect all the decisions made by the parents for their children’s data.Ensure that you have implemented reasonable security practices for your website to protect children’s information.COPPA does not apply to all the websites that exist on the internet. It applies to websites thatdo not have age-restrictions when users sign up.are offering services tending to children and collecting their personal data.have an ad plugin that collects personal information specifically about children.Companies can use various age-verification techniques to know the exact age of their users. I have discussed some of these techniques here.We have discussed COPPA privacy policy requirements in detail in this article. Apart from these requirements, a privacy policy must contain:information about third-parties with whom the processing of personal data is delegated;types of personal data being collected and the manner of collection; andrights of parents/guardians on their children’s personal data.Before collecting personal data of children, companies must give clear and concise notice to parents for receiving parental consent. This notice must not contain any irrelevant or confusing content. This notice should inform the parents that:their contact information has been collected for the purpose of parental consent;the website seeks to collect their child’s personal information;parental consent is necessary for collecting and disclosing personal information of children;the parental consent notice is linked to the company’s privacy policy; andif parents do not give their consent in a reasonable amount of time, the website will automatically delete their contact information.This notice should also mention the ways through which parents can provide their consent.COPPA does not list any exhaustive method to obtain verifiable parental consent. However, some of the acceptable methods are:Parents sign a consent form and send it back to the company through fax, postal service, or email.The service requires a credit/debit card or similar online payment systems that are bound to notify the parents about a transaction.Parents call a toll free number staffed by trained professionals.Websites ask for some kind of hard identification from parents, provided that companies delete this information after the verification process completes.Parents answer knowledge-based challenge questions that would be difficult for kids to answer.Parents submit a driver’s license or any other photo identity card for comparison with another photo using facial recognition technology.A website shall inform the parents about any updates in its privacy policy. The communication shall also include:methods available with parents to review their child’s personal information collected by the website;methods for revoking the parental consent, or refuse further use or processing of their children’s personal information; andtheir rights related to personal data of their children, including deletion.COPPA expects companies to implement reasonable security practices for their websites. The idea behind COPPA is to give the highest priority to the best interests of children. The same should reflect in security practices adopted by a company. COPPA requires companies to not to retain data for a period longer than actually required. Further, it also restricts the sharing of personal information only with those third-parties who are capable of maintaining confidentiality, integrity, and availability of such information.Some businesses may perceive COPPA compliance to be difficult and complicated. However, it has immeasurable benefits in the long-term when we talk about the online safety of children. In the last two decades, FTC has passed many landmark rulings that have shaped how companies collect and process personal information of children. I will be discussing some of these rulings in my next article. Meanwhile, I hope that once PDPB becomes an act and comes into effect, the Indian data protection authority will prescribe similar requirements for Indian companies.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Cyber crime and laws in Japan: An overview",
    "data": "Cyber crime and laws in JapanThis is my third article in the series covering cyber laws of various countries. Through this series, the objective is to discuss what they are doing to deal with technology-facilitated crimes. The first and second articles covered New Zealand and Norway, respectively. In this article, I am focussing on Japan. The country ranks 19th in the HDI rankings. Over the years, it has been considered as one of the most literate and technologically advanced countries. It is the seventh most powerful country in the world. Overall, the country has a low crime rate, but cyber crime has shown an increasing trend. Let’s see if Japan has taken sufficient measures to control the menace of cyber crimes.As of 2019, Japan had 119 million active internet users. In the Asia-Pacific reason, this is the fourth highest user base. Japan’s National Police Agency (NPA) recorded 130,000 cases in 2017, followed by 127,000 cases in 2018. Cyber crime caused an estimated loss of $2.1 billion to Japan in 2017. A 2018 survey found out that 40% of Japanese citizens have not heard about cyber bullying. According to NPA reports, phishing is a leading cause of online scams while child pornography is a major type of cyber crime.Japan’s Penal Code, 1907 consists of the following offences, punishments, and penalties:Infecting a computer system with improper command records such as a virus: Imprisonment up to 3 years or fine up to JPY 500,000Storing such improper command records: Imprisonment up to 2 years or fine up to JPY 300,000Obstructing a business by damaging a computer or giving improper command records: Imprisonment up to 5 years or fine up to JPY 1,000,000Obtaining illegal financial benefits by providing false information/records: Imprisonment up to 10 yearsObstructing a business by hacking: Imprisonment up to 5 years or fine up to JPY 1,000,000Illegal benefits obtained through phishing: Imprisonment up to 3 yearsThis statute disallows the following acts:Unauthorized access, including hacking: Imprisonment up to 3 years or fine up to JPY 1,000,000Obtaining or keeping the identification code wrongfully: Imprisonment up to 1 year or fine up to JPY 500,000Provide illegally obtained identification code to someone else: Imprisonment up to 1 year or fine up to JPY 500,000Impersonating an access administrator through acts such as phishing: Imprisonment up to 1 year or fine up to JPY 500,000This act lays down the responsibilities of the government for maintaining and upgrading the country’s overall cyber security posture. It has also established a Cyber Security Council. This council, in coordination with support from businesses, is responsible for the implementation of cyber security measures across various industries.This act seeks to protect the secrecy of communications. If a telecommunication service provider knowingly infringes the secrecy of communication, it breaches Article 4(1) of this act.This is the primary data protection legislation in Japan. It defines personal information as “any information which helps identify a person, like name, date of birth, or any other description.” An organization cannot disclose personal information without receiving consent from the person it belongs to.The act on “Punishment of Activities Relating to Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, and the Protection of Children” is a special legislation focussing on child pornography and related offences in Japan. This act prescribes heavy punishments for child prostitution and child pornography. Even after the implementation of this law, reports suggest that child pornography is readily available. In one prominent incident, Japanese police arrested six individuals for abusing a total of 168 minors. Victims were between 4 to 13 years of age while the perpetrators were 20 to 66 years old.Over the years, Japan has maintained a dominant position in the global economy. While it was mostly successful in controlling the crime rate in the country, cyber crime has appeared to be a prominent issue for the country. As per my initial research, the existing legal framework is sufficient. However, there is always a scope for modifying the current laws and introducing new laws to match the pace of technological developments.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "PDPB and children’s data privacy in India",
    "data": "PDPB and children’s data privacy in IndiaChildren account for one-third of the global internet user base. In the eyes of the law, a child’s “consent” has often been insufficient. I am sure you have seen that most of the Indian websites do not consider a user’s age while asking for consent for their services. Rule 4 of the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 requires body corporates to put up privacy policies for collection and disclosure of personal information. As of now, there is no legislation covering children’s data privacy online, but the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) may turn the tables around.Section 3(8) of the bill defines a child as a person who is below 18 years of age. The bill’s Chapter IV only focusses on children, processing of their data, and rights thereof. Before the bill came into shape, the Justice Srikrishna Committee mentioned in their report that differential treatment and increased rights are required as children are unable to justify their actions and they are excessively vulnerable. I believe that the bill incorporates this opinion very diligently in the fourth chapter.Section 16 mentions that a data fiduciary must keep children’s best interest in mind and take all possible precautions to protect their rights. It also requires data fiduciaries to perform age verification and prescribes receiving consent from parents/guardians. As of now, parental consent must be in line with the requirements of Section 11. Many social media platforms’ minimum age requirement is 13 years, and the bill is a good reminder that their practices may soon become invalid.Under Section 50(6)(h), the bill places an obligation on the Data Protection Authority to suggest mechanisms for age verification and processing of personal data of children. At this point, it becomes necessary to understand how the UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code and Children Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 (US) require and regulate parental consent. The Indian DPA, whenever it comes into existence, must consider best practices from across the globe and explore their implementation in the Indian context. As per Section 16(3), it should consider the following factors while drafting a regulation:The volume of personal data being processedThe proportion of personal data belonging to childrenWhether the processing of such data harms a child?Other factors, as prescribedFor entities that operate children-centric commercial websites or process large volumes of personal data of children, Section 16(5) designates them as guardian data fiduciaries. The bill bars such data fiduciaries from profiling, tracking, performing behaviour monitoring, or advertising targeted at children. It also prohibits guardian data fiduciaries from undertaking any processing activity that can cause significant harm to children. For data fiduciaries offering counselling or child protection services, the bill contains specific provisions under which they are not bound to take consent from a child’s parents.The bill imposes deterrent penalties for contraventions related to Chapter IV. For an entity, the maximum penalty can be ₹15 crores or 4% of global turnover, whichever is more. GDPR prescribes similar penalties to ensure that this issue is not taken lightly by covered entities.The enactment of this bill will introduce new compliance requirements for existing companies. Many business owners would believe that it will increase their compliance costs. I think this is a necessary step to protect the privacy of children online. We need global efforts to ensure a safer cyber space for children. The bill’s implementation must not be lacklustre and remain unregulated. It is also pertinent to note that Chapter IV title mentions “sensitive personal data”, but Section 16 does not. Therefore, I believe the bill’s existing version lacks in explicitly mentioning restrictions on the sensitive personal data of children. Further, restrictions for guardian data fiduciaries are way lesser in scope as compared to significant data fiduciaries. Ideally, this should not be the case as guardian data fiduciaries will be processing children’s data on a large scale.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "How to download Aadhaar card in DigiLocker app?",
    "data": "DigiLockerAs we move towards the end of this decade’s first year, e-Governance has become a necessity for governments across the globe to provide their services to citizens. With the launch of Digital India initiative on July 01, 2015, we have seen many useful platforms to cater to our day-to-day requirements. One such platform is DigiLocker which seeks to digitally empower citizens by issuing them digital documents.As per Rule 9 of the Information Technology (Preservation and Retention of Information by Intermediaries Providing Digital Locker Facilities) Rules, 2016, documents issued to a user’s DigiLocker account are at par with the original physical documents. For example, you can show your Aadhaar card in the DigiLocker app while entering an airport. Another example can be showing your DL & RC to traffic police. While doing initial research for this article, I found out that a substantial proportion of citizens have no idea about what this app is and how it can be useful. This is the first article in my series covering important applications of DigiLocker. In this article, I will discuss the step-by-step procedure to download Aadhaar card in DigiLocker app.The first step is to download and install the DigiLocker app on your phone.

    "headline": "Facial recognition, incidents of abuse, and issues",
    "data": "Facial recognition, incidents of abuse, and issuesHave you posted a picture on Facebook and got a recommendation to tag yourself or your friends? This is not rocket science, it is facial recognition technology at work. In contrast to other biometric features such as iris, fingerprints, and palm printing, facial biometrics are intractable. Facial recognition is primarily used in security-based applications such as airports, surveillance systems, protect facilities, etc.In criminal investigations, law enforcement agencies utilize facial recognition to identify a suspect from their database. For crime prevention, one may argue that facial recognition can be an effective technology. There are plenty of examples that support this argument. At the same time, facial recognition technology without any laws or regulatory guidelines may be prone to misuse. Combining facial recognition with artificial intelligence, as experts argue, may turn into a dangerous tool for mass surveillance of citizens.Various news reports have found that China uses facial recognition technology (FRT) to track and monitor Uyghur Muslims. This makes a good ground for racial discrimination, and it is a warning that the slippery slope of surveillance has started to spiral. An Asia Times report found that Israel has used FRT for clandestine surveillance of Palestinians. On similar lines, Moscow is working on a proposal to allow law enforcement agencies to track persons of concern. This proposal also seeks to provide the police with FRT-ready glasses. Research studies at MIT and Georgetown have concluded that FRT is less accurate in the identification of people of color.In 2018, the Greater Manchester Police monitored visitors around the Trafford Centre for more than six months without permission, until they were told to stop using the technology. Over the years, Japan has come at the forefront of using AI and FRT. They have planned to install FRT-based systems in gambling houses and racecourses to get help in their fight against gambling. In the recent Black Lives Matter protests in the United States, law enforcement agencies heavily relied on FRT to identify the protesters. In January 2020, an interesting case of false positive came up. An FRT-based system wrongly identified a shoplifter and resulted in a wrongful arrest in the US due to this technology.As of now, India does not have a specific legislation that regulates the implementation of facial recognition systems. It becomes necessary for the Parliament to pass a comprehensive law to oversee the long term implementation of this technology. One of the prominent arguments against the implementation of FRT is the violation of privacy under Article 21. The special law on facial recognition must balance the rights of individuals and the state. In line with the interpretation of the honorable Supreme Court in K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, adoption of facial recognition technology without any legal procedure will amount to the violation of fundamental rights. The technology was recently used in the national capital during the Anti-CAA protests to identify the individuals involved in attacking police officers and damaging public property.Many US states have enacted certain laws to regulate the usage of FRT in their respective jurisdictions. Illinois became the first US state to ban the use of facial recognition systems. To protect the privacy of its citizens, the government passed the Biometric Information Privacy Act of 2008. Before this, Texas had passed a bill in 2002 to restrict the use of facial recognition in commerce. The Texas Business & Commerce Code forbids the selling of biometric information and prescribes detailed consent requirements for collecting biometric data.Through the Body Camera Accountability Act (AB 1215), California has implemented a complete ban on the operation of facial recognition technologies and other local authorities. This ban will remain in force for three years. Similarly, Washington passed a bill to regulate the use of facial recognition technology by law enforcement agencies. Washington state laws grant certain exemptions to companies to store biometric information for security reasons.1. Privacy and data protection: As we discussed earlier, this technology is capable of conducting mass surveillance programs. Even though an individual is in a public place, the places they visit will be unique for them. Without appropriate legal safeguards, facial recognition can directly violate an individual’s privacy. Lawmakers must ensure that prospective laws and regulations contain sufficient measures to prevent the abuse of such systems.2. Accuracy: As of now, there are no industry-accepted standards for FRT systems. Accuracy of facial recognition systems varies from one vendor to another. Some studies show that identification errors are persistent, and deployment of an under-developed technology can be harmful.3. Ageing: Technological advancements in storage and data processing technology will facilitate the storage and processing of vast amounts of data. However, ageing is a natural process, and our faces change as we grow older. Is it viable to use a facial recognition system without regularly updating its database? This is one of the questions that the researchers need to address.4. Ill intentions and misuse: As uncle Ben once said, “With great power comes great responsibility.” While we have already discussed many instances of abuse of this technology, I am sure there are many more which are yet to come in the limelight.Along with discussing legal issues pertaining to FRT-based systems, we also need to discuss the security of these systems. When one introduces facial recognition technology, it generates vast data sets containing personal information of individuals. With the announcement of Cyber Security Policy 2020, India must adopt a holistic approach to embrace and regulate any emerging technology. There should be a fine balance between the needs of law enforcement agencies and the fundamental rights of citizens.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) and Educational Institutions",
    "data": "Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) and Educational InstitutionsThe Supreme Court recognized privacy as a fundamental right under Article 19, 20(3), 21, and 25 of the Indian Constitution. The 9-judge bench delivered a unanimous judgement in the much-celebrated case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India. After this judgement, the Central Government instituted a committee under the leadership of former SC judge Justice B.N. Srikrishna. The objective of this committee was to examine the existing challenges due to a lack of data protection laws in India. Further, it was responsible for providing suggestions for these challenges and drafting a data protection bill. After public consultations, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) introduced the bill as the Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB), 2019.After being introduced on December 11, 2019, the bill is currently with the Joint Parliamentary Committee (JPC) as of today. It is expected that the JPC will submit its report before the Parliament in the budget session for this year. Once passed, the bill will bring a paradigm shift in the legal obligations of organizations while processing personal data across all sectors.Educational institutions can include schools, colleges, universities, and coaching/training institutions. As of today, the cycle starting from admission to graduation is data-intensive. Such institutions collect, process, store, and generate personal data belonging to individuals.Further, educational institutions also store information about disciplinary proceedings and academic records. At times, internal processes/procedures of institutions may generate such information. As health and financial data constitute sensitive personal data under Section 3(36) of the bill, educational institutions will see increased compliance requirements once the bill is enacted.Here, it becomes significant to understand the difference between private and government institutions under the definition of educational institutions. Government colleges, schools, or any such institution may be governed separately as they can be categorized as services provided by the government. Educational institutions are most likely to fall under the definition of data fiduciaries, and Chapter II of the bill becomes applicable. Further, they will need to show compliance with transparency and accountability measures laid down in Chapter VI. Given that academic institutions will also store and process large volume of personal data of minors, they can be guardian data fiduciaries under Chapter IV. In some instances, institutions will be considered as significant data fiduciaries under Section 26, due to the sensitivity and volume of personal data.Chapter VI speculates that the covered entities should prepare a privacy by design policy to fulfil Section 22 requirements. This policy will cover technical systems and business practices and aim to avoid harm to data principals. A data fiduciary will be responsible for the secure processing of sensitive personal data. If an academic institution is considered as significant data fiduciary, they will be bound to appoint data protection officers and conduct data protection impact assessments (DPIAs) whenever they bring in a new technology to process sensitive personal data.Privacy of data principals will take centre-stage after the enactment of this bill. The act will require data fiduciaries to take explicit consent and collect data specific to the purpose. The onus will rest with educational institutions to prove that they have obtained explicit consent while dealing with sensitive personal data. It should provide the following information to a data subject: Category and nature of personal dataDuration of data retentionRights of data principalsThird-parties with whom personal data will be sharedGrievance redressal mechanismsAt this juncture, it appears that there is a dire need to frame rules and guidelines to regulate the collection, usage, destruction, and retention of personal data by educational institutions.In the case of minors, parental consent becomes a necessity. However, as per Section 16(7), a guadian fiduciary may not require parental consent. The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act of 1998 from the US is an excellent example of how parental consent can be taken.Miscellaneous records of students such as disciplinary actions, performance analysis, etc. may fall under the definition of personal data. Educational institutions will require prior consent from data principals to share their data with third-parties. However, exceptions under Sections 12 and 13 may allow an institution to process such information without consent. Can a data principal can ask a data fiduciary to delete data pertaining to poor disciplinary/academic records?If an institution falls under the definition of guardian data fiduciary, the bill restricts certain activities related to personal data of minors. Once an institution fails to comply with such obligations, it stands to face penalties under Section 57. For educational institutions, one may argue that monitoring/profiling is necessary to a certain extent. Also, it will be interesting to see how data principals will exercise their right to be forgotten against educational institutions. While it is true the Parliament is yet to pass the bill, a well-thought approach is the need of the hour to regulate processing activities of educational institutions.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Personal information, parental consent, and COPPA",
    "data": "Personal information, parental consent, and COPPAActing on the Center of Media Education’s petition, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) started an investigation into data collection practices of kidscom.com. Back in the 1990s, this popular website targetted individuals between 8 to 14 years of age. It allowed users to interact in a virtual world using avatars. As the website brought in significant changes, FTC did not bring charges. The necessity of parental consent and informing parents about risks lead to the drafting of the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, 1998 (COPPA). The then President signed the bill on October 21, 1998, and it came into force on April 21, 2000.The main goal of this act is to ensure that parents have control over their children’s data collected by online platforms. This act defines “children” as individuals below 13 years of age. It applies to all commercial service providers or operators that collect, process, and retain information from children. It also applies to service providers that do not have a lower age restriction, but they do have actual knowledge that they are collecting, using, or processing personal information of children.The act provides an inclusive definition of personal information. The definition includes:First and last name of a childAny address-related information of a childAny way to contact a child such as a phone number, email address, etc.Telephone numberSocial security numberAny kind of audio or visual of a child;Geolocation information sufficient to identify street name and city/town of a childAny identifier available on multiple websites that can be directly linked to a childSearching a child through their username on a website and contacting them via this username, orAny other information that directly or indirectly identifies a child.COPPA requires online service providers to implement a privacy policy concerning their collection, usage, and disclosure of children’s personal information. They must provide direct notices to parents about the changes in their privacy policies. COPPA’s privacy policy requirements are:Name, address, contact details, and other necessary information about the website operatorDescription of types of information being collectedInforming the parents that they can deny the collection of their child’s personal information Information about other operators, if involved via plugins, contact forms, etc.A privacy policy shall be clear, understandable, and conciseLinks to the privacy policy shall be close to the area where a website is requesting for information.If a mobile application is collecting information, the privacy policy should be available on the home page.If there is a general-purpose website that also caters to children, such websites shall have a separate privacy policy.Section 312.5 deals with parental consent. An operator shall obtain parental consent before collecting, processing, storing, or disclosing any personal data belonging to a child. It must retake the consent if there is any change in the requirements. Further, the act places an obligation on operators to verify parental consent using technology-based solutions. Some of the possible ways to achieve verifiable consent are:Sending a consent form to a parent’s email address or postal address;Credit/debit cards providing explicit notifications to parents about transactions; orUsing hard identifiers such as government-issued ID cards and signatures.Here, it is essential to note that an operator must take parental consent before collecting or processing data. If an operator is unable to obtain parental consent, the act prohibits them from collecting personal data of children under Section 312.7. Parents also have the right to review the personal information collected from their child, irrespective of the fact whether they gave their consent or not.COPPA appears to be a stringent legislation that seems to comprehensively address concerns related to children’s data. It seeks to ensure that the operators follow acceptable security practices and standards (Section 312.8). The scope of applicability is not limited to US-based operators, it also applies to websites that are collecting data from children in the United States, whether knowingly or unknowingly. As per Section 312.9, FTC is responsible for the enforcement of this act. Over the last two decades since this act came into force, FTC has prescribed hefty fines against many major operators. In one of my upcoming articles, I will be discussing such incidents wherein FTC has levied fines from prominent online platforms.Check out our Digital Parenting Guide for setting up Google Family Link app here.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Cyber crime and laws in Norway: An overview",
    "data": "Cyber crime and laws in NorwayThis is my second article in the series covering cyber laws of various countries. Through this series, the objective is to discuss what they are doing to deal with technology-facilitated crimes. The first article covered cyber crime and laws in New Zealand. In this article, I am focussing on Norway. For the past ten years, the country has maintained the highest HDI value. It topped the rankings for the happiest country in 2017. On top of this, it is one of the countries with the lowest crime rate in the world. Let’s see whether Norway has taken sufficient measures to curb the menace of cyber crimes.Recently, Specops Software, in their research, found that the European countries are highly prone to cyber attacks. This report also found that Norway is the second safest countries as it only accounted for 1.38% of cyber attacks in Western Europe. Further, the country also paved its way in the list of top 10 countries, as per the Global Cyber Security Index (2018). On the other hand, a 2019 survey covering 886 companies found that over 45,000 cases of computer hacking, theft, and fraud were recorded. Only 1 out of 9 Norwegian organisations had an in-depth action plan.The Personal Data Act, 2000 is the primary law focussing on data protection and privacy rights of individuals. This act ensures that personal data is processed in the context of factors such as personal integrity, private life, and right to privacy. It defines personal data as “any information which relates to any person” and processing of personal data as “usage, storage, and recording of personal information of any person.” It provides for different conditions for processing personal data and sensitive personal data. Under the definition of sensitive personal data, it includes race, ethics, political opinion, philosophical and religious beliefs of a person. It also covers information about suspicion/conviction for a criminal offence, health, and sex life.As per Section 19, a controller has to provide the following information before collecting personal data:Controller’s name and addressName and address of the controller’s representative, if anyPurpose of data processingSharing of personal data with third partiesDetails of third parties with whom personal data will be sharedYou can access this act here.The Penal Code, 2005 provides for the protection and lawful exchange of information under Chapter 21. It prescribes punishments for acts such as:Intentionally procuring a password or computer program (Fine and imprisonment up to 1 year)Obtaining illegal access to a computer system (Fine and imprisonment up to 2 years)Meddling with data belonging to another person without permission (Fine and imprisonment up to 1 year)Possession of malware (Fine and imprisonment up to 1 year)Obstructing the working of an IT system or creating operational disruption (Fine and imprisonment up to 2 years)Violation of the right to private communication (Fine and imprisonment up to 2 years)Norway is one of the most technologically advanced countries with access to the internet. 86% Norwegians use Facebook daily while Snapchat is the most popular application. A Norwegian Media Authority (NMA) survey found that most of the children above 10 years of age have access to the internet. In the age group of 9 to 18, 1 out of 4 children was a victim of cyber bullying and online harassment. Further, 13% of individuals between the age group of 13 to 18 years accepted sending their nude pictures over the internet. 20% of them received sexual comments online, which were offensive in nature.Various local news reports have noted a startling increase in online child sexual abuse in Norway. Kripos, or the National Criminal Investigation Service (NCIS), has stumbled across thousands of IP addresses involved in the dissemination of child sexual abuse material (CSAM) online. Easier access to the internet, technological developments, and the popularity of dark web are contributing factors. To read more about regulating dark web and challenges, click here.NCIS, in coordination with European police, is a part of the program called Police2Peer for catching the perpetrators involved in sharing of CSAM online.NCIS also plays the role of the national hotline for reporting the incidents of CSAM online.The Norwegian government has launched the Escalation Plan against violence and abuse (2017-2021) to fight against online child abuse and exploitation.Norwegian Data Protection Authority has started a service called SlettMeg.No or popularly known as “Delete Me.” This service works with online platforms for removing/de-linking of unwanted content.Barnevakten, an NGO, has started an initiative called Bruk Hue (Break Your Head) to spread cyber awareness in schools. It also helps individuals in battling online harassment.NMA has also initiated a project called Trygg Bruk (Safe Use) for assisting children in following good cyber security practices.Over the years, Norway has consistently maintained its HDI ranking. While the crime rate remains in control, it is commendable to see various governmental and non-governmental initiatives. Like many countries, Norway also launched its contract tracing app called Smittestopp to control the spread of COVID-19. However, many privacy experts, including the national data protection authority, criticised the application due to its highly privacy-invasive nature. After this, the Norwegian health authorities suspended the application.

    "headline": "Serving of legal notices and summons through WhatsApp",
    "data": "Serving of legal notices and summons through WhatsAppThe Indian justice delivery system has gone through plenty of changes this year as far as digitalisation of processes and procedures is concerned. Judges, as well as advocates, have slowly adapted to virtual courtrooms. Not just court hearings, ICT (information and communication technology) is also facilitating filing of cases, tracking, and availability of court orders/judgements. While Indian courts have been slow in accepting digital mediums as a mode of serving summons and notices, the last few months do tell a different story. I have discussed digital justice system in India here.Central Electricity Regulatory Commission v. National Hydroelectric Power Corporation Limited is one of those cases where the court has discussed the serving of notices through email. Here, it is also essential to discuss the nexus between serving of legal notices through digital medium and admissibility of electronic records. Consider that a party sent a legal notice through email to the opposing party before instituting the suit. This notice may be submitted before the court as a piece of evidence. Cases such as Anvar v. Bashir and Shafhi Mohammad v. State of Himachal Pradesh created confusion regarding certificate requirements under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While the honourable Supreme Court recently clarified its stand in the case of Arjun Panditrao Khotkar v. Kailash Kushanrao Gorantyal, the court also issued the directions for framing of rules under Section 67C of the Information Technology Act, 2000. These rules are expected to deal with retention, preservation, retrieval, and production of electronic records.The word notice itself means knowledge. In the context of summons and legal notices, one can interpret to bring into the knowledge of the defendant/respondent about the initiation of proceedings by the plaintiff/petitioner. Traditionally, a legal notice is delivered through the postal system. A notice is deemed to be served only when the defendant receives or refuses to accept the delivery – which is sufficient to consider that the defendant is aware of the said matter. The proof of delivery or refusal gives a clear picture as to whether notice was served or not.Our systems move with infuriating slowness – glaciars melt faster than service through the Sheriff’s office.– Justice Gautam S. Patel, Judge, Bombay High Court In the case of SBI Cards & Payments Services Pvt. Ltd. v. Rohidas Jadhav, the Bombay High Court accepted the service of notice through WhatsApp as the blue ticks indicated that the message was delivered and read. Similarly, in the case of Kross Television India Pvt. Ltd. v. Vikhyat Chitra Production, the defendant denied any receipt of any legal notice on his WhatsApp account. However, the delivery indicators on WhatsApp were considered as proof of delivery, and the defendant’s contention was defeated.WhatsApp allows a user to configure whether they want to let the sender know that they have read the message(s). In both the cases that we discussed above, the defendants had enabled the delivery of read receipts to a sender. These “read receipts” can be considered as conclusive proof that the defendant has received a message and read it. If a party has disabled read receipts, will the court still be able to ensure that the notice had been duly served? Or in other words,What will the courts do if the “blue tick” does not appear, despite the fact that a notice has been delivered to the defendant?Consider a situation when party A submits a screenshot to contend that their notice had been delivered to party B. However, party A can save the contact of Mr X as party B’s name. Subsequently, party A can demonstrate that the notice had been served. To go a step further, Mr X can use the same profile picture as used by party B.Mr K.K. Venugopal, the Attorney General, submitted before the Supreme Court in a 2019 case that summons shall be allowed to be served through either fax or email, but not through WhatsApp. He referred to a Tamil Nadu case where the Government asked WhatsApp to decrypt some of the messages in the interests of national security, law, and order. WhatsApp denied this request stating that their platform is end-to-end encrypted. He further submitted that WhatsApp often fails to cooperate with police authorities citing the same reason. This directly hampers the investigation in critical cases.APK stands for Android Application Package. Android operating systems use this file format for the installation of applications. Similarly, iOS uses IPA, which stands for iOS Application Archive. Over the years, there have been many modified APKs such as GBWhatsApp, WhatsApp plus, WhatsApp prime, etc. Modified APKs provide certain features which are not available in the original WhatsApp application. These modified APKs promise features such as the ability to download status, set custom last seen, hide double ticks, and whatnot. If party B is using a modified APK and hides their double ticks and puts a last seen of two years ago, they would receive the notice sent by party A, but the sender would not have any knowledge of the same.As far as my interactions with the team members go, the opinions are clearly divided on whether WhatsApp is a reliable platform to send legal notices and summons. One might believe that the traditional way was better than using WhatsApp. Are Sections 11, 12, and 13 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 applicable in the context of WhatsApp conversations? This is another question that courts need to answer. Meanwhile, it becomes imperative for the parties to not leave any loose ends while sending legal notices.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Cyber Security for Lawyers: Inspirations from Canada",
    "data": "Cyber Security for Lawyers: Inspirations from CanadaThis is the second article in our series on Cyber Security for Lawyers. Through this series, we aim to initiate a discussion on why cyber security is essential for lawyers and suggest best practices for modern-day legal professionals in India. In the first article, we focussed on a guidance document published by the UK’s General Council of the Bar. In this article, we take a look at the practices being followed by Canadian legal professionals.Canadian Bar Association (CBA) published a guideline titled Legal Ethics in a Digital World. Prepared by CBA’s Ethics and Professional Responsibility Committee, these guidelines build on similar guidelines published earlier in 2008, 2009, and 2014. They recognise the role of technology in contemporary legal practice. At the same time, it accepts that a lawyer should be able to understand how to use technology responsibly and ethically. Unline USA, where the use of technology is explicitly mentioned, several ethical obligations under different codes of practice suggest the appropriate use of technology. The main objective of this guideline is to assist lawyers in identifying potential ethical issues related to their legal practice and recommend best practices. As per their research, CBA has found that security, marketing, and providing services electronically are three areas where lawyers most often face ethical risks in using technology.Traditionally, cyber security measures aim to protect the CIA triad – confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Similarly, lawyers need to ensure that they implement the required measures to protect confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data.Even without technology, lawyers have a professional obligation to hold client information in strict confidence. While professional rules do not cover specific measures concerning lawyers’ usage of technology, PIPEDA can provide guidance on the types of security measures that must be followed. Further, this guideline also suggests the lawyers to consider the applicability of provincial privacy laws to their practice. It states that confidentiality measures should not be limited to technical controls, they should also include physical measures. It recommends the following best practices:Locking file cabinets and restricting physical access to officesImplementing security clearance and limiting access on a need-to-know basisUsing robust encryption algorithms to protect data during transmission as well as when it is at restUsing a VPN to access client information over the cloud, instead of carrying a USB/hard-disk driveAvoid using public wireless networksTaking appropriate measures while discarding a storage device such as wiping, scrubbing, or shreddingPreventing inadvertent disclosure of metadata containing confidential informationImplementing an incident response plan for your law firmHere, integrity does not refer to a lawyer’s duty to upload the standards of the legal profession. In the context of cyber security, integrity means protecting data from modification, alteration, or destruction, whether accidental or unauthorised. It is also closely linked with authenticity, non-repudiation, and traceability. In general practice, electrical/digital signatures are preferred to maintain the integrity of data while communicating online. Lawyers should consider implementing the following best practices:Implement sufficient security measures to monitor the integrity of available data.Use technical measures such as digital signatures, archival policies, backups, and metadata comparison.In Canada, the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, 2000 (PIPEDA) and the Electronic Commerce Act, 2000 (ECA) deal with the legality of electronic signature.Data should be accessible and usable when required by an authorised user. Unavailability may be a result of power failure, server maintenance, natural disasters, and cyber attacks. Hence, there must be backup procedures in place containing the following best practices:Regular backupsStoring backups in an off-site locationRoutine checks to ensure that data can be restored when neededInsurance protection in place for recovering lost hardware/informationIn Canada, lawyers are bound by the Model Code of Professional Conduct which states that“A lawyer may market professional services, provided that the marketing isdemonstrably true, accurate, and verifiable;neither misleading, confusing, or deceptive, nor likely to mislead, confuse, or deceive;in the best interests of the public and consistent with a high standard of professionalism.”As far as marketing is concerned, the suggested best practices include:A law firm website should include an appropriate disclaimer in terms of use or elsewhere regarding construing the available information as legal advice.If a law firm uses email/social media for marketing purposes, it should comply with the requirements of the Canadian Anti-Spam Legislation.Prevent inadvertent disclosure of confidential information while marketing through social media platforms.Implement a well-defined social media policy for prescribing standards and protocols for your law firm’s employees.Providing legal services over the internet expands client development opportunities and has great potential to improve access to legal services. At the same time, it brings forth numerous security and compliance risks. Instead of benefitting the client-lawyer relationship, such risks may have a negative impact in the end. A lawyer can provide their services over email, social media platforms, through video conferencing solutions, and other telecommunication services. This guideline suggests the following best practices while providing services electronically:Responding to tweets or comments on a social media post may be misconstrued as a consultation. This creates a lawyer-client relationship in the mind of a client. Always put a disclaimer while posting information online and keep a record of online communications to defend against a claim that legal advice was given.While providing legal services over emails, email spoofing, phishing, and spear-phishing are serious risks. A lawyer should always verify the identity of a client before sharing any confidential information.Take reasonable steps to determine the actual identity of people you are dealing with to avoid the risks related to conflict of interest.Take all reasonable steps to ensure that a client correctly identifies a lawyer and communications thereof.Inform your clients about the risks associated with communicating by email and video conferencing tools.While concluding the last article, we discussed how compliance with data protection laws is unavoidable for lawyers and legal professionals. Irrespective of whether guidelines like this are mandatory in nature or not, incorporating good security practices in the delivery of legal services will never be a wrong choice on any given day. In the upcoming articles in this series on Cyber Security for Lawyers, we explore more such countries where the legal community is discussing cyber security and adopting good security practices.An initial draft of this article was prepared by Akshara P. Kamath, an undergraduate student at Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad, during her internship with The Cyber Blog India in June/July 2020.With inputs from Raj Pagariya.Featured Image Credits: Job vector created by stories – www.freepik.com and Travel vector created by freepik – www.freepik.com."

    "headline": "#OpenUp: How, when, and where?",
    "data": "#OpenUp: How, when, and where?After the global pandemic hit the world and the nationwide lockdown was imposed, everything came to a standstill. While many of us were involved in spending time with families and learning new skills, a few did not refrain from being involved in unethical/illegal activities. A recent report by the National Legal Services Authority (NALSA) indicated a rapid increase in cases of domestic violence throughout the country.Even after considering The Cyber Blog India’s limited reach, the average number of victims contacting us per day has gone up by at least 250% after lockdown came into force. This trend is also visible in the cases involving female victims. On similar lines, many organisations like us have reported an increased number of female victims contacting them for help and support. Read more on COVID-19 and cyber crimes against women here.Recently, a fifteen-year-old girl immolated herself after some individuals filmed her bathing and started to blackmail her along with demanding sexual favours. One of the boys who was involved in this incident was a minor. The victim was compelled to take such a drastic step because of the fear that her video will get uploaded on social media. This is not the first instance when a girl has committed or has attempted to commit suicide because of being filmed without her consent and subsequently blackmailed. Such incidents shall be considered as a wake-up call for all of us to open up and report such matters before it is too late.I would not be wrong in saying that most of us do not know the rights we have and legal remedies we can seek – if we face any issue in cyber space. Minors are often involved in certain situations where they should not be. On top of that, they neither know the consequences nor rights and liabilities. We have talked about minors, harassment, and the internet in this short video. So often, we trust the other person in our relationship and share pictures/videos which are later used for blackmailing and unwanted sexual favours. Even if you are facing the worst case scenario, you need to understand that there are remedies available and self-harm is most certainly not the way out. If you are in a situation and not able to report it as your identity will be revealed or there will be a news article with your name, I assure you that is not going to be the case. The law enforcement agencies are bound by the laws to not to disclose your identity.We, at The Cyber Blog India, have noticed that minors often avoid sharing such incidents with their parents. While we understand that what they are going through is really difficult, it is challenging to make them believe that their parents are on their side – not the blackmailer’s. At this point, I would not deny that we certainly need an open discussion in our homes on issues like this. Even if you are not a minor and someone is blackmailing you, reporting such incidents is the solution that you go for.In 2019, the Ministry of Home Affairs set up the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal to streamline reporting of cyber crimes from across the country. This portal also allows you to file a complaint anonymously, however, you would not be able to track the progress on your case. In case your complaint is not processed for one reason or other, the portal has a list of nodal officers and their contact information that you can get in touch with. This article explains how to file a complaint on the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal.Besides, you can always approach us for help and assistance across any platform you are comfortable with: be it Email, WhatsApp, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, or Telegram.Under Section 63 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015, there should be a designated Child Protection Officer or Child Welfare Officer attached to every police station. The District Legal Services Authority is responsible for training CPOs/CWOs. The general guidelines available for training of such officers explicitly states that training must be provided on the non-disclosure of a minor’s identity and avoiding any enquiry which would hamper the best interests of the children. The honourable Supreme Court, through its judgement in Sampurna Behrua v. Union of India & Ors., directed the High Courts to set-up child-friendly courts in their jurisdiction.The Information Technology Act, 2000, the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012, the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 are relevant laws when we talk about blackmailing/harassment of individuals. In the following sub-sections, I have listed relevant provisions, punishable acts, duration of imprisonment, and fines.Relevant provisions from the Information Technology Act, 2000Section 67B is wider in its ambit and also covers:Creating text/images, collecting, seeking, browsing, downloading, promoting, or exchangingFacilitating online child abuseRecording in any electronic formCultivating, enticing, or inducing children to online relationships with one or more childrenObscenity is a highly subjective area but we have tried to understand how Indian courts deal with related issues here.Relevant provisions from the Indian Penal Code, 1860Depending on the specifics of a case, relevant provisions from the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 can also be used.Back in 2014, a similar incident occurred wherein a 17-year-old girl had committed suicide leaving behind a six-page long suicide note. She had mentioned the name of an “online friend” in the note who had morphed and uploaded her pictures on a social-networking site. Thereafter, the police investigated and arrested the individuals mentioned in the note. The girl might not have known remedies available and the importance of opening up and reporting the incident. Her family would have surely helped her come out of the situation, had she been courageous enough to report it. Keeping in mind the current scenario where such crimes have been accelerating at a rapid pace, we need to open up and report such cases. We shall strive towards getting the culprits punished as it would instill fear among the perpetrators, refraining them from committing such crimes in future. Suicide is not a way out to deal with such incidents. We shall remember that Section 23 of the Prevention of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 prevents the disclosure of the identity of victims. Also, Section 74 of the Juvenile Justice (Care and Protection) Act, 2015 bars the disclosure of the identity of minor victims of sexual offences even after they’re dead. It is never too late to self-evaluate and try to fill up the communication gap prevailing at our homes. No person, irrespective of their age, should think that committing suicide is a better option than reporting the incident.Do check out our series titled “My Cyber Crime Story” where victims/survivors narrate their experience of facing a cyber crime and how they came out of it.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "headline": "Can a bank be liable in phishing cases involving fraudulent transactions?",
    "data": "Bank liability in phishing casesHave you ever received emails with a subject such as “Congratulations, you have won Rs 1 lakh, just click the link to claim the money!!” or other emails with similar context? Most phishing emails appear to be very attractive and lucrative. Phishing scams are a type of social engineering attacks that manipulate the users into sharing their sensitive personal information such as passwords, ATM card information, internet banking credentials, and other financial information.Fraudsters keep on devising new ways and reasons to trick the users into sharing their personal information. At times, they may add an element of fear by stating that their card or account will be blocked. You may receive an email with a subject “Your bank branch is updating their database, please fill the form attached in the email to make sure we have the correct information.” On receiving such an email, many individuals would be triggered to submit their details so that they do not miss out on receiving updates from their branch. Please note that banks never ask you to update your information through this way. This is a phishing email, and you must avoid it. For more information on phishing, feel free to check this article.If you ask any cyber law specialist about a bank’s liability in a phishing case, they will most likely tell you that since a customer himself/herself authorised the transactions, the concerned bank is not liable. Generally, phishing scams are successful due to lack of due diligence at victims’ end. Under the impression that the email is genuine, the victims believe the contents of the email and end up sharing their confidential information. In the last few years, even RBI has issued multiple guidelines to decide the liability in cases of unauthorised transactions. These guidelines affix the liability based on whether a customer has been negligent or not.Contrary to the general understanding of liability in phishing cases, a different opinion was observed in Prothius Engineering Services Pvt. Ltd. v. IndusInd Bank Ltd. The learned IT Adjudicator for the State of Maharashtra ordered the bank to pay a compensation of ₹20.55 lakhs to the victim.The complainant (Prothius Engineering Services Pvt. Ltd.) alleged that they received an email from exclusivee@indusind.com on January 09, 2014. This email informed the complainant that the bank was updating its database and required the following information from the complainant: current account number, branch name, and registered mobile number and email address. It also contained a form that was supposed to be filled and sent back through email for updating the database.On receipt of this email, the complainant also informed the bank’s official for verifying the authenticity of the email. It is alleged that the said official did not perform due diligence for the same. The bank called on January 21, 2014, to inform the complainant as their account had insufficient funds to clear a check issued for ₹ 13,65,968. According to the complainant’s belief, this was not possible as their account had approximately ₹ 42 lakhs.Between January 18 to 21, 2015, debits aggregating to ₹ 14,05,000 were made from their account and the same was informed to the bank with proper notification to freeze the account on the same date and furnish its account statement. The complainant also reported the bank that they were not able to access their internet banking. Even after sending a formal notification for freezing the account, the complainant noticed another transaction of ₹ 6,50,000. Subsequently, the complainant again directed the bank to disallow any further transactions.Aggrieved by this, the complainant filed a suit before the Adjudicating Officer under Sections 43, 43A, 43(b), 43(g), 61, 55, 66C, and 46 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 on September 08, 2014. In its complaint, the complainant stated that the bank shared the details of beneficiary accounts and informed that the matter was under investigation. However, despite several follow-ups, the bank has failed to revert the money lost via fraudulent transfers. The complainant sought relief of ₹20,55,000 at 18% interest from the date of transfer, along with ₹60,000 for the loss of 100 man-hours, a compensation of ₹1,00,000 under Sections 43 and 43A, along with ₹50,000 travelling costs incurred, and any other relief deemed fit.In their response, the bank denied all the submissions made by the complainant. It stated that the said email ID is not owned by the bank. The complainant should have noticed the incorrect spelling of “exclusive” in the email address before responding. Further, the complainant informed the bank on January 10, 2014, while they had already replied to the said email a day before.Respondent number 2, Vodafone India Limited, has submitted that the registered mobile number of the complainant with the bank was active on the days of alleged fraudulent transactions. Vodafone submitted that it only acted as an intermediary under the Information Technology Act, 2000, and hence, it is exempted from any liability. Further, they denied having issued three impugned numbers involved in this case. The second respondent also submitted that the complainant is aware that it is not liable in the present case as the complainant has not made it a party to the dispute filed before the Hon’ble State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, Maharashtra.After the complainant informed the bank about the receipt of such an email, no material has been presented to indicate that the bank took any measures to check the genuineness of the said email or replied to the complainant. While it is clear that complainant has fallen prey to a phishing fraud, the impugned email address is in the name of the bank’s domain. This indicates that either the phishing email originated from the bank or there was a security lapse in the bank’s IT system, including its mail servers.The bank pleaded that their internal investigation showed delivery of OTP while adding a beneficiary, the complainant clearly appears to be tricked by the use of the bank’s domain. The bank cannot be simply relieved of its responsibility by contending that the complainant missed the spelling error. It is the perpetrator of the fraud who can be held liable under Section 43(a) and 43(b), not the bank. However, it is clearly established that the bank’s unsecured server and negligence provided assistance to the fraudsters and it stands liable under Section 43(g) read with Section 85 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Further, the IT Adjudicator also concluded that the bank is in breach of security policies they were obligated to follow in accordance with the applicable RBI circulars. There is nothing on record to substantiate the involvement of the second respondent, and it was discharged.The IT Adjudicator directed the bank to pay a compensation of ₹20,55,000 to the complainant within one month of the order. It is clear that the compensation amount only covers the amount fraudulently withdrawn and excludes other relief as sought by the petitioner. Advocate (Dr.) Prashant Mali, a leading cyber expert and well-known lawyer, represented the complainant in this case. In an interview with the Indian Express, he said that the fight for recovering the lost money began in 2014. The case had been pending for six years, and the forum should have made the respondent pay for legal expenses accrued, interest, and other damages incurred by the complainant.This case may hold a high precedential value in the times to come. It is imperative to understand that the banks shall strive to achieve the highest level of security possible. They are not only bound by the Information Technology Act, 2000, and the guidelines issued thereunder, the banks also need to comply with the relevant RBI guidelines. In the present case, lack of due diligence and the involvement of a domain email address were the deciding factors, it will be interesting to see how the jurisprudence of phishing evolves in India in the next few years.An initial draft of this article was prepared by Srushti Iyer.

    "headline": "Cyber crime and laws in New Zealand: An overview",
    "data": "Cyber crime and laws in New ZealandI had heard it often that cyber crime is one of the major issues of the 21st century, in terms of prevention as well as the number of incidents. In over six months of my association with The Cyber Blog India and going through the cases we get daily, I now have a fair idea of ways in which cyber crimes affect individuals and different spheres of their life – mental, emotional, and financial. To deal with cyber crimes, countries across the globe have adopted different approaches. I will be writing a series of articles covering cyber laws of various countries and discuss what they are doing to deal with technology-facilitated crimes.In the first article of this series, I am focussing on New Zealand. The country ranks 14th in terms of Human Development Index (HDI), and it lost close to $6.5 million because of cyber crimes. For Q2 2020 (April to June), it lost $1.7 million more than what was reported in the last quarter. On average, it takes around 28 days to resolve a cyber crime case in New Zealand.As per the Global Peace Index 2018, New Zealand was ranked the second safest country. However, an April 2020 report stated that 1/3rd of New Zealanders have faced a cyber crime incident in the past 12 months. A NortonLifeLock Cyber Safety Insights Report made similar observations and estimated that 36% of citizens (approximately 1.2 million) became cyber crime victims in 2019. Additionally, nearly 5.4 million man-hours, or an average of 4.3 hours/victim, were dedicated to solving the problems created due to cyber crimes.One study found that 1 out of every 6 adults in New Zealand has experienced some form of identity theft. This number, in terms of population, is close to 605,000 and 5% victims were directly affected in 2019. The same study found that:67% of the participants had no idea what to do if their identity is stolen.85% of the participants accepted that they need more information about possible measures.56% of the participants were seriously concerned about their identity being stolen.Another report found that New Zealanders’ distrust of social media providers exceeds the global average. The global average stands at 43% while in the case of New Zealand, the number stands at 54%.  It was also found that NZ citizens trust health care services and government more as compared to the global average when it comes to healthcare services, administration, business, and protection of personal data.Section 249 to 252 cover cyber crime and related offences under the head “Crimes involving computers.” A cyber crime is defined as a criminal act which can only be committed using the Internet where the device or the network is the target o the offence. This is regardless of what a criminal intends to achieve. It can be political, financial gain, espionage, or any other reason. As per the Act:A person, who acquires any computer system, whether directly or indirectly, with dishonest intention or deception and without any right and gets hold of any property, privilege, service, pecuniary advantage, valuable consideration, benefits, or trigger any loss, is liable for imprisonment up to 7 years.A person, who either with intention or due to recklessness, destroys, causes damage or happens to alter any computer system with the knowledge that their action might cause danger to life, will be liable for imprisonment up to 10 years.A person, who offers another person to obtain from him, buy from him, agree to buy from him, or in any other way sells software which enables that person to access a computer system without authorisation, and he knows that doing such a thing is a commission of an offence or promotion of commission of an offence, will be liable for imprisonment up to 2 years.A person, who either directly or indirectly, acquires any computer system with an intention but without authority and with the knowledge that he is doing so without authority or recklessly, will be liable for imprisonment up to 2 years.This legislation sets up certain offences when a person is being harassed or bullied through online platforms. Online platforms include texts, emails, websites, applications, and social media platforms. The main aim of this act is to lay down a speedy and friendly way to tackle such cyber crimes and streamline takedown of harmful content, while at the same time, ensure the freedom of speech and expression.Under this act, NetSafe, an independent non-profit online safety organisation, runs a helpline service to support individuals experiencing harm online, such as image-based abuse and cyber bullying. It also runs campaigns to educate and sensitise end-users about the threats they may face and how to deal with them. In New Zealand, an individual can even approach the District Court for requesting the removal of a harmful post with immediate effect, among other remedies.This act also establishes certain principles to be followed online for acceptable behaviour. These principles say that “digital communications” that are sent to you or are about you, should not:Reveal your sensitive and personal informationThreaten, intimidate, or have menacing characterBe extremely offensive in the eyes of a well-judged and reasonable manContain indecent/obscene materialBe of harassing natureContain false allegations about youContain such information or data which was given by you to someone for private useEndorse a third person to send you such material which will cause harm to youPersuade you to give up your lifeDiscriminate or degrade you based on your colour, race, ethnic or national origins, religion, gender, sexual orientation, or disability.Criminal cases: Local police stationObjectionable material or possible gaming offences: Department of Internal AffairsCyber security incidents and data breaches: CERT NZCyber safety help from NetSafeBased on initial research, it appears that New Zealand is quite proactive when it comes to dealing with cyber crimes. Organisations like NetSafe are actually the need of the hour that can facilitate reporting of cyber crimes and provide the necessary support and assistance to victims. As cyber crimes and cyber attacks continue to grow in numbers and impact, it has become an uphill battle for governments and law enforcement agencies across the globe.Interested in contributing to our blog and knowledge base?

    "data": "Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 3): Possible Legal IssuesThe first and second parts of this series talked about what AI is and how it is being adopted in the legal industry, respectively. While there is no denying that the existing legal system is not equipped to deal with AI-based systems, we need to discuss legal issues associated with AI and initiate a discourse on exploring possible solutions.(This is a three-part series on Artificial Intelligence and Law. You are currently reading the third part. Links to other parts are available at the bottom of this article.)\nIf an AI-based system causes harm to an individual or property, who will be liable? How are we going to enforce civil and criminal liability on an AI-based system? Consider the earlier example of Tesla’s autopilot mode that resulted in the death of a passenger. What if it had been an individual waiting to cross the road? Are we going to enforce the liability on the car’s owner or the company that manufactured the car? Can we interpret the doctrine of absolute and strict liabilities in the context of AI devices? These are the shortcomings we need to discuss.If an AI-based system is capable of thinking and acting on its own, will it be able to enjoy the intellectual property rights? If yes, how would it be able to enforce its right against an individual who has copied its original piece of work? Or will we recognise AI-based systems as copyright owners/patent holders in copyright/patent law? While it is a well-recognised fact that legal personhood is not only granted to human beings, the Indian courts are yet to adjudicate on a matter relating to personhood and intellectual property of an AI system.Can an AI-based system enter into a contract on behalf of an individual or company? Or in other words, can a power of attorney be signed in favour of an AI-based system? Section 11 of the Indian Contract Act, 1872 defines the requirements for a person competent to enter into a contract. As of now, the definition of a legal person cannot be interpreted to encompass AI-based systems.The Competition Act, 2000 seeks to provide a legal framework and ensure that anti-competitive practices are prevented. Consider that a well-known company purchases a flurry of AI-based systems for making predictions about customers’ buying patterns. Can a startup with limited resources claim that the former is abusing its dominant position in the market? While having a dominant position in the relevant market is not a problem, it must not be abused. Indian competition law needs to evolve to incorporate anti-competitive practices concerning AI-based systems.AI-based courts have become a reality in the Chinese city of Hangzhou. According to a Chinese news agency, more than 3 million legal activities have been processed by the users. Such courts run without any time limits, and they are providing legal services at a rate which was never achieved before. This system of courts uses blockchain technology for record-keeping and making the documents readily available for the users.With augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) market to grow up to $150 billion in revenue by the end of 2020, upcoming startups may utilise these technologies for virtual courts. It will be interesting to see how AR and VR are adopted to provide legal services or bring a paradigm shift in the functioning of virtual courts.If AI as technology becomes successful after implementation, it has the potential to disrupt how traditional legal processes work. The author firmly believes that with AI at the helm, “access to justice” will get a new meaning. As we only have the Information Technology Act, 2000 as the single law to regulate technology-based offences in India, our legislators need to give serious attention to the regulation of emerging technologies such as AI and blockchain.Read the first and second parts of this series:Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 1): Introduction and DefinitionArtificial Intelligence and Law (Part 2): Possible Applications and Current ScenarioThis article has been written by Akhil Mishra. He is currently an undergraduate student at Amity Law School, Delhi.Disclaimer: Views or opinions expressed in this article, whether impliedly or explicitly, are personal.Edited by Raj PagariyaFeatured Image Credits: Background vector created by starline – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 2): Possible Applications & Current Scenario",
    "data": "Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 2): Possible Applications & Current ScenarioThis second part of the series on Artificial Intelligence and Law focusses on the role of AI in a lawyer’s life. It seeks to address how AI can be beneficial to a legal practitioner. The first part presented an introductory discussion on Artificial Intelligence. In case you missed it, you can check it here. (This is a three-part series on Artificial Intelligence and Law. You are currently reading the second part. Links to other parts are available at the bottom of this article.)For a lawyer or legal professional, legal research and contract review will be the simplest of use cases for an AI-based system. AI can assist efficiently in performing repetitive tasks. For maximum utilisation of AI-based system, a legal professional must have good judgement, analytical skills, research skills, understanding of due diligence, and good communication skills. On the other hand, some of the essential characteristics needed in AI-based systems to assist legal professionals are:Capacity to predict and adaptCapacity to be reactiveMaking decisions on its ownCapability to move and perceiveCapability to analyse data quicklyAutomating repetitive tasksIf an AI-based system possesses such qualities, a legal professional can utilise their time on important tasks. Based on my research, I have identified three areas where AI-based systems are (or will be) useful for legal professionals.For corporate transactions, contracts are the lifeblood. Manual review of contracts takes a substantial amount of time, while an AI-based system may give its results in a few minutes. Lawgeex, Klarity, Clearlaw, and LexCheck are on the frontlines to provide AI-based contract review services.Once a plaint is submitted before a court of law, the next step is to reply to the written statement submitted by the defendant. Using predictive analysis, law firms and legal professionals can make informed decisions by understanding possible defences that may be put forth. Case assessment can also help in finding the relevant precedents for a set of facts. Blue J Legal is one such AI prediction engine that claims to find relevant case laws from facts. A couple of recent studies have been able to achieve an accuracy of 70% and 79% for finding relevant cases from the US Supreme Court and the European Court of Human Rights, respectively.A legal research activity may take days to get completed. A legal professional needs to go through articles, books, case laws, briefs, acts, amendments, rules and guidelines, online sources, etc. While most of these sources have been digitalised, one still needs to filter through the search results to find the required cases or laws. AI-based solutions such as ROSS Intelligence provide question-based search, document analyser, and case overviews to simplify the overall legal research process.AI is yet to be predominantly adopted by the legal professionals in India. With the push for digitalisation of court records and processes, it is expected that we will see increased adoption in the legal fraternity over the next decade. In 2017, Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas became the first Indian law firm to adopt Kira Systems to use AI in their day-to-day legal practice.IIT Kharagpur researchers have also developed an AI-based program to analyse judgements and advice laymen about laws being violated in any given situation. Further, this program also predicts if it would be useful to take the matter to court and legal costs will be minimised as a result. Another AI-based solution that deserves mention is MikeLegal. Based out of India, this solution aims to streamline how lawyers research. As of now, it focusses on intellectual property law.Adoption of AI by the Indian legal community is still at its nascent stages. However, we will see many more startups focussing on providing quality AI-based legal services for legal professionals. Instead of looking at AI-based systems as a replacement of human beings, one should look at AI as a tool to help deal with tedious tasks in a cost-effective manner. While AI systems have a fair share of advantages, they are also accompanied by a good deal of disadvantages. These disadvantages are covered in the third part of this series.Read the third and first parts of this series:Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 3): Possible Legal IssuesArtificial Intelligence and Law (Part 1): Introduction and DefinitionThis article has been written by Akhil Mishra. He is currently an undergraduate student at Amity Law School, Delhi.Disclaimer: Views or opinions expressed in this article, whether impliedly or explicitly, are personal.Edited by Raj PagariyaFeatured Image Credits: Background vector created by starline – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 1): Introduction and Definition",
    "data": "Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 1): Introduction and DefinitionThe concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) helping human beings has been long engraved in the minds of people. The movie industry has often shown us how AI can help humanity venture far out into space, or find new ways to make their day to day life easy. Contrary to that, they also showed us the devastating impact it can have on the whole world if left unchecked or unregulated. However, they have failed to show us legal implications, time and again.(This is a three-part series on Artificial Intelligence and Law. You are currently reading the first part. Links to other parts are available at the bottom of this article.)As a legal professional, one may have several questions related to the legal enforceability of the whole premise of AI such as:What are the statutory changes that need to be made?Will there be any substantial changes in the existing laws?How is it going to help the justice delivery system at large?Is it going to bring a positive change?If you are reading this article, I would like to draw your attention to the implementation of AI-based applications and how they will be adopted. If applications of AI are considered in the context of legal services, AI is capable of going through thousands of words and files in a few minutes. To do the same amount of work, a legal professional may take a day or two. AI can seamlessly automate and streamline daily routine tasks such as contract review, legal research, case notes, and document analysis. With this ease, there comes a fear of replacement that AI-based systems will replace legal professionals. However, the same is not the case as they can focus their time and attention into doing something much more productive. While discussing AI and legal services, it is important to mention that AI will never be able to replace someone who has years of experience, or someone who understands basic human emotions and empathy.At present, many organisations are using AI to facilitate different types of legal services. For example, Kira Systems claims to provide accurate due diligence while analysing contracts. LawGeex is another contract analysis software relying on AI to deliver meaningful benefits. Irrespective of how advanced AI systems may get, they will continue to require human touch to ensure that false positives are kept at a minimum.For a layman, the understanding of AI may be limited to mere robots. However, in a real sense, there is a much broader definition. J. McCarthy, M.L. Minsky, N. Rochester, and C.E. Shannon’s project titled “A Proposal for the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence” is one of the earliest instances of research work that defined the term. Alan Turing, an English mathematician and often referred to as the father of AI gave vision to what AI is in the 1950s. In one of his papers published in 1950, he asked, “can machines think?”AI, in a general sense, can be defined as a technology that can have basic human thinking or can produce results based on what it learns on its own. It can also mean that AI is just a way through which human intelligence can be mimicked by machines or any software it is injected in. The body is not what defines the term here, but rather the means, its capability, and its self-learning algorithm.AI can be of two types:Weak AI: AI systems that work within a limited scope such as search engines or self-driving cars. It can self learn and thus be able to produce better results as time goes on, and as more data is fed into the system.Strong AI: It refers to systems with human-level intelligence that can be applied to any given human task. This type of AI is still a dream of the future, as the development of such an AI would only be possible once we perfect the weak AI.Later on, Turing put forth another question that asked if technology could imitate what human beings do. At present, there is no correct answer to his question, and it is both yes and no.Yes, as many systems can imitate essential human functions and logical thinking to an extent. For example, Deep Mind’s AlphaZero mastered the game of chase in just four hours and competed with the best programs available in the public domain.No, to achieve human-like intelligence is reasonably complex. You can Google and find many incidents where self-driving cars have resulted in the deaths of human beings. One such incident is about the death of a passenger who left his Tesla car on autopilot mode. Before we move on to the next part of this article, as Norvig and Russel stated, AI should be capable of:Thinking humanlyThinking rationallyActing humanlyActing rationallyAI as a technology is expected to play a prominent role in the future. It is not a dream anymore. You can look around yourself and see its implementation. Even though it is an evolving technology, it is making a significant impact on our day-to-day lives. In the next part of this series, I talk about how AI-based applications are explored in the legal domain and how it can help a legal professional on a daily basis.Read the second and third parts of this series:Artificial Intelligence and Law (Part 2): Possible Applications and Current ScenarioArtificial Intelligence and Law (Part 3): Possible Legal IssuesThis article has been written by Akhil Mishra. He is currently an undergraduate student at Amity Law School, Delhi.Disclaimer: Views or opinions expressed in this article, whether impliedly or explicitly, are personal.Edited by Raj PagariyaFeatured Image Credits: Background vector created by starline – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code: A code of practice for online services",
    "data": "UK’s Age Appropriate Design Code (2020): A code of practice for online servicesThe United Kingdom’s Parliament passed the Data Protection Act in 2016, and it came into effect on the same day as the EU GDPR. The Data Protection Act of 2018 (“the act” or “UK DPA”) is Britain’s implementation of GDPR. Recently, the Information Commissioner (“ICO”) published the Age Appropriate Design Code on August 12, 2020. The code will come into force on September 02, 2020, with a twelve-month transition period.Section 123(1) of the UK DPA requires the Information Commissioner to implement a code of practice for age appropriate designs of services which are likely to be accessed by children. The sub-section reads as follows:“(1) The Commissioner must prepare a code of practice which contains such guidance as the Commissioner considers appropriate on standards of age-appropriate design of relevant information society services which are likely to be accessed by children.”The same provision defines the phrase age appropriate design as “the design of services so that they are appropriate for use by, and meet the development needs of, children.” Prior to the publication of this code by the ICO, the State Secretary laid the code before the Parliament under Section 125(1)(b) of the act on June 11, 2020.According to the statistics available with the ICO, children account for one-fifth of the total number of internet users in the United Kingdom. In one of their surveys to find about data protection problems faced by the UK public, they found out that child data protection is the second-most highlighted concern. This survey’s results resonate with the findings of a London School of Economics’ research. Further, this code is implemented in consonance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child requirements which advocate for special safeguards for children in all spheres of their life. While similar reforms are being considered in the USA and other European countries, it is expected that this code will pave the way for other countries to take a step forward for children’s welfare and their rights on the internet.The code aims to protect the interests of children within the digital world, instead of protecting them from it. It prescribes fifteen loosely defined standards for age appropriate design. One of the intentions of this code is to ensure that the principle of privacy by design is implemented with a particular focus on the country’s younger generation. For example, if a child changes their settings, the concerned service provider will inform them of the consequences, how their data will be used afterwards, and what they can do to prevent or allow the same. While the organizations are given a transition period of twelve months, this code is in line with the requirements of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations (PECR).This code divides the age range in the following manner:0-5: Pre-literature and early literacy6-9: Core primary school years10-12: Transition years13-15: Early teens16-17: Approaching adulthoodOrganizations that do not cater to any of the above-mentioned age ranges need not consider that age range while designing their services. However, such organizations need to specify in their privacy policy that they have not designed their services for those age range(s). In line with UNCRC’s objective, the code also mentioned considerations for disabled children. It adopts a risk-based approach to the processing of personal data of children and lists the following factors that must be considered:Types of data collected;Volume of data;Intrusiveness of profiling;Whether decision-making or similar actions follow after profiling; andWhether data is being shared with third-parties.Though the code does not sponsor any particular method to determine a user’s age, it does provide a list of possible ways for the same, but this list is not exhaustive and non-binding in nature. I have discussed the listed methods below.As the name itself suggests, the service will ask a user to enter their age during the registration process. This method may not be useful as a user can easily lie about their age. Hence, the ideal use cases for this method involve low-risk processing services.A service may use artificial intelligence (AI) to determine a user’s age based on their interaction with the service. If an organization implemented an AI-based system for this purpose, it must ensure that:Minimum amount of personal data is being collected.Users are aware that an AI-based system will check their age.The personal data collected for age determination is not used for any other purposes.This method will involve the sharing of a user attribute with a third-party for determining a user’s age. The third-party age verifier will only respond yes or no to the service provider’s questions. This method reduces the amount of personal data collected by an organization. Similar to the last method, an online service must inform its users about the involvement of a third-party age verifier.This method proposes implementing joint accounts for parents and children. By utilizing this method, the service provider can store a parent’s information, and they do not need to store a child’s personal data.This method proposes implementing sufficient technical measures to disallow a user from entering the incorrect age. Such technical measures can include:Closing or deactivating under-age accountsNeutral presentation of age declaration screensPreventing a user from immediately resubmitting a new age if they are denied access because of their ageHard identifiers include passports, government-issued identity cards, and similar identification mechanisms. However, it should entirely depend on a user whether they want to provide such hard identifiers or not. This is mainly because children do not have easy access to such formal documents. Involvement of hard identifiers in the age determination process can also infringe the privacy of adults associated with a minor. In case a service is asking for a hard identifier, it should not be the only option available.The age appropriate design code establishes a flexible set of requirements for improving online safety of children. If an organization does not have any certainty for the age of its users, the design should be implemented by considering minor users at large. The code also expects that service designs should be transparent about the rights each age group has. Hence, I believe that this code will prove to be impactful for the online safety of children, while at the same time, it will instil a sense of responsibility in them concerning their data. The explanatory memorandum to the Age Appropriate Design Code 2020 may help you in gaining detailed insights with respect to the events leading to the implementation of this code.(In the next article, I will be discussing the standards prescribed in this code.)Featured Image Credits: Computer photo created by standret – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Cyber Security for Lawyers: Inspirations from the UK",
    "data": "Cyber Security for Lawyers: Inspirations from the UKInformation Technology (IT) has transformed how many industries used to function and businesses were run. To this paradigm shift, the judiciary and legal industry are not exceptions. This article is a part of our series on Cyber Security for Lawyers through which we aim to initiate a discussion on why cyber security is important for lawyers and suggest best practices for modern-day legal professionals in India. In this article, we derive best practices and inspirations from the United Kingdom (UK).The Information Technology Panel of the General Council of the Bar has prepared a guidance document to assist barristers with maintaining a reasonable level of information security for protecting client information. Last reviewed in July 2019, this document is not legally binding on any barrister; however, it prescribes a series of good security practices under various heads which should be followed as a minimum.As per the handbook published by the Bar Standards Board (BSB), a barrister isResponsible for protecting the confidentiality of each client’s affairs, except for such disclosures as are required or permitted by law or to which your client gives informed consent (rC15.5)Responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure that proper arrangements are made for ensuring the confidentiality of clients’ affairs (rC89.5)At gC134, the BSB handbook sets out the following requirements to fulfil the obligation under rC89.5:Implementing and enforcing adequate procedures for the purpose of confidential information,Complying with data protection obligations imposed by law,Taking reasonable steps to ensure that anyone who has access to such information or data in the course of their work must comply with these obligations, andTaking into account any further guidance on confidentiality which is available on the BSB handbook.Barristers working for Government departments/agencies are required to comply with the Attorney General’s Guidelines on Information Security and Government Work. For the purpose of our discussion in this article, data protection laws include the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the UK’s Data Protection Act of 2018.Recommended security practices across various heads are elaborated below:Should not be kept in a position where it might be read by any other person entering the roomShould not either be worked on or read in a public place where others can overlook itShould be stored in a secure place for which the barrister has regular accessShould be moved securely and should not be left unattended during the travelAs representatives of the parties, barristers are in the role of data controllers for parties’ copies of court papers, documents provided for the use of witnesses, and any document supplied earlier for the exclusive use of the court. All such documents must be removed immediately after a hearing ends. If court papers containing sensitive personal data are left unattended in a court or court building, a data breach may be reported as per applicable data protection laws.A barrister must take appropriate steps to ensure the physical safety of PCs, laptops, tablets, PDAs, smartphones, and USB drives containing confidential data. Recommended practices are:Devices should not be left unattended in a car overnight or at a public place.Devices used for professional purposes should be kept and used in a manner that their screens cannot be overlooked.Losing confidential data stored on devices and removal storage is a violation of the BSB handbook as well as applicable data protection laws. It is recommended to minimise the confidential data stored on removable storage devices (refer to data minimisation in Article 5.1(c) of GDPR).A barrister should process personal data to ensure its security, including protection against unauthorised/unlawful processing and accidental loss, damage, destruction (refer to integrity and confidentiality in Article 5.1(f) and 32 of GDPR). Similar precautions should be adopted with respect to confidential data of clients that do not fall under the definition of personal data. Encryption and pseudonymisation are recommended safeguards. Good security practices prescribed are:Perform regular scans for malware and keep software and applications up to date.Avoid clicking on links in emails or downloading attachments/files from sources you do not know or trust.Phishing emails can also be fabricated to appear from a colleague or a client.Set up a secure password for PCs, laptops, tablets, smartphones, and other such devices.Change the default passwords.Use different passwords for different services and devices.Using biometric technologies (fingerprint/facial recognition) are acceptable alternatives to passwords.Take regular back-ups of information stored electronically. Back-up media used for confidential data should be locked away and disconnected from the main network when not in use. If back-ups are taking place over the cloud, point-in-time recovery should be possible.Devices used at home to access confidential data must be protected from unauthorised/unrestricted access by third parties.Storage of personal information or confidential data on any device should be in encrypted form. Encryption is also necessary for password-protected devices. Whole disk encryption should be preferred over encrypting particular folders.Any code, password, or device to be used for emergency recovery of encrypted data should be stored in a reasonably secure manner.Encrypted email communication should be used. A barrister can agree with the client about what encryption to use.Password required to decrypt an attachment should not be sent in the same email as the attachment.Caution is advised while using CC and BCC features for sending confidential data.If a barrister is able to access their emails across devices, all such devices should be password-protected and encrypted.Lists of previously used phone numbers, email addresses, and fax numbers should be maintained and kept up to date.Connecting to public or unencrypted access points should be avoided.A barrister should not make their computer detectable by others on the network.Besides, the barristers should exercise caution while selecting an email service provider as the data protection laws specify restrictions on the transfer of personal data to the countries outside European Economic Area (EEA) which do not provide an adequate level of security. It is recommended to choose a service provider who provides data storage facilities in EEA.Barristers using cloud services should assure that their selected service providers have sufficient safeguards in relation to confidentiality, security, reliability, availability, and data selection procedures. Similar to what is recommended for email service providers, service providers based out of EEA should be preferred. Irrespective of whether a cloud service provider encrypts files or not, barristers should consider encrypting data themselves before it is uploaded to the cloud.Consider whether there is a more appropriate means to send the information, i.e., courier service or email.Double-check the fax number on which fax has to be sent.Inform the sender not to leave the fax unattended in an open office space.If the fax contains highly sensitive information, confirm with the recipient that the fax machine has sufficient papers, and someone is ready to receive the fax.Use a cover sheet to highlight the intended recipient and confidentiality.Call the recipient to ensure that the entire document has been received.There should be an information risk policy in place to safeguard the information within chambers.A barrister should take reasonable steps to ensure the reliability of IT and other staff who have access to IT systems.All the individuals associated with a chamber, including barristers, pupils, and other staff, should be given training on the importance of information security.There should be a procedure in place for reporting any loss of electronic media or papers containing confidential data. When a loss/theft occurs, the client and if required, the police should be informed immediately.Every chamber should maintain a log of devices where confidential data is stored, along with serial numbers and details about the encryption software installed on those devices.When a chamber outsources certain services to a third party, the outsourcing arrangement should not alter a chamber’s obligations to the client. The chamber/barrister continues to remain responsible for complying with relevant obligations. Outsourcing arrangement is subject to contractual agreements such that the service provideris subject to confidentiality obligations same as that of a chamber/barristerprocesses any personal data under the instructions received from the chamber/barristeris required to allow BSB or its agents to obtain information or inspect the records concerning the outsourcing arrangement, andprocesses any personal data under outsourcing arrangement which is compliant with the applicable data protection laws.Such service providers processing personal data on a barrister’s behalf will be considered as data processors. There should be a contract in place as per the requirements of Article 28 of GDPR.Data protection laws require that personal data should not be retained for longer than it is needed. However, this maybe seven years or more for case files.Data retention, review, and deletion schedules should be set up in chambers. For a chamber having multiple barristers, the chamber will be a data processor while the barristers will be data controllers.Individual barristers will need to implement data retention, review, and deletion on their own IT systems.There should be a procedure in place for secure disposal of confidential data and electronic media such as CD-ROMs and hard drives.This guidance document specifies that mere deletion of files, single-pass overwriting, or rewriting the disk are not efficient ways to dispose of confidential data stored on electronic media. Barristers should prefer using recognised methods to put the data beyond recovery.If a personal data breach is likely to result in a risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, it must be reported to the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO).ICO must be informed within 72 hours after a chamber/barrister becomes aware of a personal data breach.If a personal data breach is likely to result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of natural persons, it must also be communicated to data subjects without undue delay.Though this guideline is not mandatory in nature, it appears to be a good starting point to incorporate good security practices in the delivery of legal services by legal professionals. At multiple instances, we have seen that the relevant data protection laws apply to barristers/chambers, in the same manner they would apply to a different organisation. Whether a barrister or chamber adopts these practices or not, compliance with GDPR and UK DPA (2018) is unavoidable. With Indian data protection law currently in the Parliament, it will be interesting to see how our data protection law can be interpreted for lawyers and legal professionals in India.An initial draft of this article was prepared by Akshara P. Kamath, an undergraduate student at Symbiosis Law School, Hyderabad, during her internship with The Cyber Blog India in June/July 2020.With inputs from Raj Pagariya.Featured Image Credits: Job vector created by stories – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Digital Parenting Guide: Setting up Google Family Link App",
    "data": "Over the course of the last four months, we have received a large number of queries from parents who are worried about their children’s internet usage. Most of these queries are related to common issues that parents face. Riding on this motivation, I will be writing a series of articles under the series Digital Parenting Guide. This the first article in this series and I will discuss how you can set up Google Family Link app for you and your child.To download this guide as a PDF file, click here.Google Family Link helps parents in setting up digital ground rules for their children when they are playing, learning, or exploring the internet. Initially launched in March 2017, it allows  parents to:Guide their children to good contentView and manage the applications they are installingKeep a check on their screen time (set limits and lock the device)Check their live locationThere are two applications: Google Family Link for parents and Google Family Link for children and teens. The former has to be installed on your mobile phone while the latter needs to be installed on your child’s device.Starting with, you need both the devices: yours as well as your child’s. Install the parents’ app on your device and children’s app on your child’s device.On your device, open the Google Family Link application. After initial welcome screens, it asks you to select a Google account. Please note that you cannot use organisational email addresses in this application. Select your email address to proceed.Google Family Link for parents – Selecting your accountAfter selecting your account, the application asks whether this application will be used by a parent or child/teenager. Select Parent.Google Family Link for parents – Who will use this device?After this, it asks you to ensure that your child’s device is nearby. It then seeks confirmation: ready to be a family manager? Select the I’M READY button to continue.Google Family Link for parents: Are you ready to be a family manager?The application inquires if your child has an email address. It will show a code of 9 characters that you are supposed to enter on the child’s device.On your child’s device, open the Google Family Link for children and teens application. The application prompts you to select the device and email account for supervision. Enter the code when asked.Next, the application informs your child that you want to set up Family Link supervision on their device. To confirm, the child is required to enter the password for his/her Google account. It also shares the details about what parents can see/do and what they cannot. Then, the app asks the child whether they want to allow supervision or not. Once allowed, the Profile Manager should be activated on the child’s mobile device.Now, the application requires a name to be set up for the device. It asks to review the existing applications which are classified based on their age ratings.After all these steps, set up on the child’s device is done and you will be redirected to the application’s home screen.Google Family Link for children and teens – Home screenAfter the setup is completed on the child’s device, the application on your device will ask you to confirm the account you wish to supervise. Meanwhile, you should also receive an email informing you that your child has joined your family group.

    "headline": "Cyber Squatting: What are we missing?",
    "data": "Cyber Squatting: What are we missing?Yahooindia.com, Googl.com, Amazn.com, Flipcart.com, and so on. All these websites look familiar, but does something seem off? This is precisely what cyber squatting is. We usually notice peddlers in road-side markets for selling rip-offs or first copies of well-known merchandise brands with slightly misspelt names. When such activity happens in the digital space for domain names, it is called cyber squatting.While websites with deceptively similar domain names have been around for long, growth has been witnessed during the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Under the Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) regime, names related to a particular brand may come under the scope of trademark law. However, this stand used to be applicable only for physical products. Over the years, IPR regimes across the globe have recognized domain names as trademarks. While the same is yet to be done by the Indian Parliament, the courts have often considered that domain name may be considered under the scope of trademark law. In the absence of specific legislation, there remains a considerable lacuna in the Indian legal system while dealing with cyber squatting.In the United States, the Anticybersquatting Consumer Protection Act of 1999 is a dedicated legislation to deal with the cases of cyber squatting. This law allows an aggrieved party to approach the court and seek available remedies for trademark infringement. Remedies include injunction and any monetary compensation, if viable. This act does not specify any upper limit on the compensation; however, it appears that the amount will depend on the facts of a case.In Nigeria, Section 25 of the Cybercrime (Prohibition, Prevention, Etc) Act, 2015 considers cyber squatting as a criminal offence. This provision prescribes imprisonment up to 2 years or fine up to ₦5 million or both. Nigeria also has an organization called the Nigeria Internet Registration Association (NiRA) that is responsible for the registration of country-code top-level domains (ccTLDs).While there is no EU-level legislation on cyber squatting, European countries such as Belgium, Finland, France, and Denmark have enacted laws dealing with cyber squatting. The Belgian Parliament adopted the Anticybersquatting Act of 2003 to address the issue of unlawful registration of domain names. This act covers all “.be” domains and other domains where the registrant is Belgian. Before the court of the first instance, a plaintiff must show that the registrant’s domain name is identical or confusingly similar to the distinctive sign in which he has rights, and the said domain has been registered without right or legitimate interest and with a purpose to harm the plaintiff or take unfair advantage. The court can either order cancellation or transfer of the domain, but it is barred from awarding damages. To seek damages, the aggrieved party must initiate legal proceedings separately based on the merits of the case.On a global level, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) and the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN) have often worked in tandem to provide streamlined mechanisms to arbitrate disputes related to domain names. In many cases, Indian parties have approached the WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Centre. One such instance is SBI Cards and Payment Services Private Limited v. Domain Active Pty. Ltd. The Administrative Panel of WIPO Arbitration and Mediation Centre proceeded as per the Unified Domain Name Dispute Resolution Policy (UDRP) and ordered that the disputed domain (sbicards.com) should be transferred to the complainant. As per UDRP, a domain name registration is considered illegitimate if:The disputed domain name is identical or confusingly similar to a trademark or service mark in which the complainant has rights; andThe respondent has no rights or legitimate interests in respect of the domain name; andThe disputed domain name has been registered and used in bad faith.As we discussed earlier, there is no specific legislation or policy in India that deals with cyber squatting. However, the courts have come to the rescue of the aggrieved parties by acknowledging that domain names fall under the scope of trademark law. For example, in the case of Satyam Infoway Ltd v. Siffynet Solutions Pvt Ltd (Appeal (C) 3028/2004), the honourable Supreme Court observed that domain names may be considered under the definition of services given in Section 2(z) of the Trade Marks Act, 1999. In this case, the court extensively discussed how the appellants have the remedy of passing off available in the present case. Other prominent case laws on cyber squatting/domain name disputes in India include:Yahoo, Inc. v. Aakash Arora & Anr (78 (1999) DLT 285), Rediff Communication Limited v. Cyberbooth & Anr (1999 (4) BomCr 278)),Tata Sons Ltd. v. Mr Manu Kishori & Ors (90 (2001) DLT 659),Aqua Minerals Limited v. Mr Pramod Barse & Anr. (AIR 2001 Delhi 467), Nestle India Limited v. Mood Hospitality Pvt. Ltd. (2010 (42) PTC 514 (Del)), etc.Various laws can be amended to introduce cyber squatting as an offence. These laws include the Information Technology Act, 2000, the Trade Marks Act, 1999, and the Indian Penal Code, 1860. Alternatively, it can be added as a criminal offence under either the Information Technology Act, 2000 or the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and as a civil offence under the Trade Marks Act, 1999. Besides, India can draw inspirations from Nigeria to establish a regulatory authority, similar to what has been envisioned in Chapter VI of the Information Technology Act, 2000. This regulatory authority may be granted powers to adjudicate disputes related to domain names.Regulatory norms and policies need to keep evolving with technological advancements. All the traditional industries, along with upcoming sectors, are becoming increasingly reliant on IT-based services. While the Indian laws on issues pertaining to cyber space are still in their nascent stage, it is easier to bring in significant changes at this point so that we can quickly sync with the advancements presented before us.This article has been jointly written by Prakarsh and Shruti Mishra.

    "headline": "SIM Card Swapping Fraud",
    "data": "SIM Card Swapping FraudBeing a student who is currently pursuing an integrated degree in computer science and cyber law, I was very curious when I read an article in a Marathi newspaper in the last week of May. This article was printed on the first page itself, and it was in the form of an advisory issued by Pune Cyber Police who had recently registered 5 SIM card swapping/hijacking cases during the same period. The funny thing was that despite pursuing my degree in this domain, I had no idea about what SIM card swapping fraud was until I read this newspaper article and decided to dig in a little deeper.Before reading further, I would recommend you to please go through this article first. In a vishing scam, the perpetrators call a victim and lure them into sharing their confidential information such as bank account details, debit/credit card details, OTPs, etc. We can consider SIM card swapping frauds as an advanced version of vishing scams.In this type of cyber crime, the fraudsters may call under the pretext that they are calling from a telecom service company and inform you that there is an issue with your SIM card. Other common reasons they state include activation of SIM card and converting your SIM card from 3G to 4G or 4G to 5G. We have also seen cases where the fraudsters send a fake ID card issued by well-known telecom service providers to gain your trust. In addition to this, they make lucrative offers such as updating your SIM card gives you 20 GB free data per month and so on. If a victim believes that the fraudsters are genuine, the fraudsters have successfully broken through the first and most difficult barrier of human trust.Now, they ask a victim to share the number given on the back of their SIM card. This number is ICC-ID (Integrated Circuit Card – ID), and telecom service providers use this number to activate, block, or perform internal operations associated with a SIM card. It is a unique 22-digit identification number for SIM cards, just like we have Aadhaar numbers. After sharing the ICC-ID, the victim now receives a one time password (OTP) to confirm if they want to proceed further. As soon as the victim shares this OTP, the attacker can clone the victim’s SIM card into his phone. From now on, the SIM card available in the victim’s mobile will not work anymore. The fraudster will be able to access all the calls and messages as he has the activated SIM card while the victim’s SIM card has been deactivated.At this point, you may think that it is not that big of a risk for someone to receive all your calls and messages. For some readers, it may be true; however, most of us have registered our mobile numbers with banks and wallet service providers. So, a fraudster can quickly reset your internet banking password or create a new UPI account or a wallet account. If the fraudster is really smart, he may try to reset your email password so that you do not get email alerts from the bank. Even if you have enabled two-factor authentication (2FA), it is rendered useless as you will not be getting any codes on your deactivated SIM card.We have received a total of 27 cases of SIM card swapping in the last three months. In the last month, the Pune Cyber Police Station received a complaint on June 05, 2020, in which the victim was duped of ₹18 lakhs because of a SIM card swapping fraud. In this case, the victim received a message from the fraudster along with a follow-up call to update his SIM card. The fraudster asked the victim to forward the text message containing OTP to another number. By doing so, the fraudster cloned the victim’s SIM card into his phone, and it was subsequently activated. The fraudster not only accessed the victim’s bank account, but a personal loan amounting to ₹16.45 lakhs was also sanctioned in the victim’s name a couple of days later.Report the incident at the nearest cyber cell or cyber police station in your district/city.If you are not able to report the incident in person, go to the National Cyber Crime Reporting Portal website (https://cybercrime.gov.in) and submit your complaint. A step-by-step procedure for filing a complaint on this portal is available here.Get in touch with your bank’s home branch and request them to debit-freeze your account.Visit the local service centre or store for your telecom service provider along with your police complaint to get a new SIM card issued for your mobile number.Generally, we believe that enabling two-factor authentication, regularly changing our PINs, and not sharing our OTPs are sufficient security practices, and we do not need to worry about financial frauds. However, we miss the point that the fraudsters are getting smarter, and they keep on devising new methods and tactics to lure the victims into their trap. Please do remember thatIf it is too good to be true, it is most probably a fraud!Featured Image Credits: Card photo created by freepik – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Overview of DIFC Data Protection Law 2020",
    "data": "DIFC Data Protection Law 2020On May 21, 2020, the Ruler of Dubai Emirate, His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President & Prime Minister of the UAE, enacted the Dubai International Financial Centre Data Protection Law (DIFC Law No. 5 of 2020). This law repeals and replaces the previously existing Data Protection Law (DIFC Law No. 1 of 2007). The press release for announcing the enactment of this law is available here.With the enactment of this law, DIFC, being the dominant financial centre in the Middle East, Africa, and South Asia (MEASA) region, has bolstered its reputation in improvising data protection practices. This data protection law lays down the processes regarding accountability, record maintenance, general fines, applicable jurisdictions for cross-border data transfer, notifications to the data protection commissioner, etc.DIFC data protection law appears to be an amalgamation of various data protection laws across the world, notably the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). With this law, DIFC seeks to consolidate its reputation as a global financial hub by strengthening its strong regulatory ecosystem based on security, integrity, and globally accepted compliance standards. This enactment shows a clear direction for the businesses to improvise their data protection practices. It lays down several obligations for data controllers and processors. The new DIFC data protection law aims to:provide standards and controls for the processing and free movement of personal data by a controller or processor; andprotect the fundamental rights of data subjects, including how such rights apply to the protection of personal data in emerging technologies.This law will be applicable to all the companies that are registered with DIFC. Besides, the scope of applicability of this law includes processing personal data by automated means and processing activities whether personal data is or intends to be a part of any filing system.This law has made significant changes to the previous Data Protection Law of 2007. Some of the key changes include1. Accountability: Controllers and processors are now required to show compliance with Data Protection Law. One of the requirements talks about maintaining records of processing activities. Moreover, the law also imposes direct compliance obligation on the processors to ensure that mandatory contractual requirements are fulfilled in their arrangement with controllers.2. DPO: Companies involved in high risk processing activities will have to mandatorily appoint data protection officers. High risk processing covers processing activities whichinvolve the adoption of new/different technologies that increase the risk to data subjects or makes it difficult for them to exercise their data protection rightsresult in a high risk to data subjects when a large amount of personal data (including employee data and contractor data) is processedinclude profiling along with systematic and extensive automated processinginvolve special categories of personal data, i.e., sensitive data on a large scale3. DPIA: Before a data controller initiates any high risk processing activity, conducting a data protection impact assessment is prescribed.4. Privacy and consent: Companies will need to update their privacy notices to incorporate more information such as lawful grounds of processing, whether data will be transferred out of DIFC, and other information as specified in the Data Protection Law.5. Data breach notification: Under this law, there will be a DIFC Commissioner of Data Protection. Controllers are under a legal obligation to notify the commissioner if a data breach compromises confidentiality, privacy, and security of any data subject. In addition, if the risk posed to a data subject by the said data breach is high, they must also be informed.6. Rights of data subject: Apart from already recognized rights earlier, the Data Protection Law also recognizes the rights to data portability and withdraw consent. Also, the law specifies a time limit in which data subject access request must be responded to.7. Fines and penalties: The Commissioner is empowered to issue fines to parties that violate the Data Protection Law or fail to comply with the direction(s) issued by the Commissioner. Both processors and controllers may be subject to maximum fines up to $100,000. Additionally, they may be found liable by the DIFC courts to compensate individual data subjects. Not only affected data subjects can approach the relevant DIFC court, but the Commissioner can also bring an action on behalf of the data subjects who have suffered material harm due to a data breach. There is no prescribed cap for compensation under other applicable laws.The new Data Protection Law has come into force on July 01, 2020, and businesses have a grace period of three months to comply with the given requirements. Until October 01, 2020, the previous law, i.e., the Data Protection Law (DIFC Law No. 1 of 2007) will continue to remain in force.For any questions related to DIFC Data Protection Law or other similar laws, feel free to write to us at contact@cyberblogindia.in.An initial draft of this article was prepared by Sachet Sahni.

    "headline": "Is the circulation of e-papers on Telegram legal?",
    "data": "Is the circulation of e-papers on Telegram legal?COVID-19 restrictions have severely affected the distribution of print media. As a result, e-paper subscriptions have witnessed a rampant growth as traditional news houses are switching to digital papers (or e-papers) for their print daily. Simultaneously, digital copies of newspapers are increasingly being shared across social media platforms and instant messaging applications like Telegram and WhatsApp. On May 29, 2020, the Delhi High Court passed an ad interim ex parte order against Telegram application to block any channels involved in sharing Dainik Jagran newspaper in PDF format within 48 hours.Initially, Dainik Bhaskar published a news report stating that circulation of e-papers on WhatsApp is illegal and group admins will be liable for the same. They relied on an advisory issued by the Indian Newspaper Society (INS) to its members. This news report was fact-checked by India Today which stated that sharing PDFs of newspapers is not illegal as long as e-papers are freely provided, i.e., without a subscription. Based on this classification, India Today’s team termed this claim as half true. For a common man, different stances by leading media houses can be a confusing situation, and in this article, we aim to present a more precise picture by analyzing it from the perspective of copyright laws.India Today’s fact-check report is definitely informative, but there is a major issue in how it strictly classifies newspapers based on their subscription model, whether paid or free. It misses out on the point that to determine the legality of circulation, we need to probe into the terms of usage (or terms and conditions) which govern usage, circulation, and distribution of such e-papers. On the one hand, certain media houses have a clear guideline in place to control access and distribution of their e-papers. For example, The Telegraph’s one of the terms clearly states thatABP grants you permission to only access and make personal use of the site and you agree not to, directly or indirectly download or modify/alter/……., except with the express consent of ABP.Along with this statement, the Telegraph website provides for a dedicated login section. This clearly shows the intention to keep track of users accessing the content. In this scenario, the circulation of e-papers or PDFs of The Telegram cannot be considered legal. Apart from the terms and conditions available on the website, the only other way to determine the legality is through the Copyright Act, 1957.Section 52(1)(a)(ii) and 52(1)(a)(iii) of the Copyright Act, 1957 may allow a user to circulate copies of the copyrighted work if it is for criticizing or reporting of current events, i.e., fair use. However, these provisions would not allow a wholly copied piece of content to pass the scrutiny if it is not intended for any transformative usage.The main issue that has landed Telegram in trouble is the confusion surrounding the circulation of e-papers which are freely available, i.e., freely downloadable without any agreement to terms and conditions. If we look at the Telegram’s terms of service, content can be reported to the platform if it is spam, violence, child abuse, and pornography. While the Telegram’s terms of service remain silent on the issue of circulation of copyrighted material, a user may consider himself free to circulate copyrighted material without any hesitation. It is not a hidden fact that certain Telegram channels facilitate copyright infringement, the chances of being taken down when reported by the users are very less as they are not violating the platform’s terms of service in any way.On the other hand, the Financial Express allows downloading PDFs without any explicit agreement. The Statesman has a clickwrap agreement that pops up when a user seeks to download their e-paper. The user is required to agree to the terms and conditions; otherwise, he would not be able to download the PDF file. When it comes to such clickwrap agreements, a user is bound by the terms if he is given reasonable notice (as held by the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Specht v. Netscape (2001)). Before this, the clickwrap agreements were recognized as valid by the US District Court for the Northern District of California in the case of Hotmail Corporation v. Van$ Money Pie Inc (1998). While in India, judicial authorities have not yet discussed the validity of such agreements, the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, Mumbai raised serious concerns about the enforceability of such clickwrap contracts in the case of DDIT, Mumbai v. Gujarat Pipavav Port Ltd (ITA 783/Mum/2010).This leads us to a question: whether there exists an implied license to circulate PDFs of e-papers in the absence of any agreement to the contrary?Such an implied license can be assumed to exist if a newspaper publisher makes no effort to keep track of users accessing their content or downloading their e-papers. However, we can arrive at a better conclusion if we apply the doctrine of implied licensing. Owing to the absence of any user agreement, it shall be necessary to determine if the act in question is essential to give meaning to the arrangement between parties. To better understand this concept, we can refer to Field v. Google (2006). In this case, the US District Court for the District of Nevada held that since the plaintiff has an option to opt-out of caching of his web links, Google cannot be held liable for copyright infringement. In other words, Google did not infringe the plaintiff’s copyrights, and the plaintiff had granted an implied license to the search engine to display cached links to web pages containing his copyrighted work. In the same manner, it can be argued that unauthorized circulation of e-papers could have been easily prevented by including a clickwrap agreement. In the absence of such an agreement, the readers have an implied license, just like Google had for caching the copyrighted works of the plaintiff.There does not seem to be a clear-cut way to understand the concept of implied licensing in the context of the circulation of e-papers. It is difficult to justify that circulation would be protected under normal usage. Still, it shall be equally difficult to argue against the fact that a downloaded e-paper without any user agreement would imply a license to distribute it freely. We believe that the latter would be more sensible when we consider why the media houses have made digital copies available in the first place – to reach to their audience beyond traditional modes of delivery. Hence, when it comes to having an implied license to distribute, it shall depend on the terms of use of a newspaper.E-paper section on the Dainik Jagran website: Requires registration and payment of subscription chargesIn the case of Jagran Prakashan Limited v. Telegram FZ LLC & Ors (CS (COMM) 146/2020) which we discussed earlier, the Dainik Jagran website explicitly states that the website contents are not to be circulated and requires the users to register and pay the subscription fees. Due to ongoing pandemic, they had waived off the subscription fee, but the registration process remained the same as it was before. The Delhi High Court has passed this interim order in light of Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 read with the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011. The court stated that Telegram, as an intermediary, had not observed due diligence and therefore, it cannot claim any exemption or escape liability in this case.As of now, the circulation of e-papers with user agreements that prohibit circulation or distribution by the readers/users would be illegal owing to the copyright infringement of the concerned media house. For all other e-papers, it is safe to assume that their circulation over social media platforms and messaging applications will not involve any legal issues.This article has been jointly written by Raj Shekhar and Ujjwal Singh.

    "headline": "Recording calls: An admonitory feature",
    "data": "Call recording: An admonitory featureWe are all familiar with the call recording feature on our smartphones. It is a very convenient way to maintain a record of any or all the conversations and the information shared therein. We live in an era where data is one of the most valuable assets. There is a myriad of ways using which an individual’s data may be misused, and his rights are violated. In this article, we aim to explore possible threats posed by the call recording feature and how individual rights are affected.The law relating to phone tapping by a third-party has been thoroughly discussed by various courts. Put plainly, a third-party may not record any conversations between two parties without their consent. While there are certain exceptions to this rule, there is no clarity regarding the recording of a call by a party engaged in the call itself, i.e., recording our own conversations. These days, many smartphones have a feature to record incoming as well as outgoing calls.If this feature does not come in-built, there are a large number of third-party apps that allow a user to record his calls. In all such cases, the other party has no idea that their call is getting recorded. However, Google has made recent efforts in the latest Android update that notifies all the users that their call is being recorded as soon as anyone of the call participants starts the call recording. This feature is yet to be adopted widely, and it does not address the issue of the other party having a chance to disallow recording.After the call gets over or when the user recording the call stops the recording, the audio file gets saved to their phone, and it can be used in any way they desire. So, should features like this exist when seen from the perspective of privacy?The Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 defines personal information as any information using which it is possible to identify a person. The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 gives a comprehensive definition under Section 2(28) and includes any and all data relating to any attribute of an individual and by which that individual may be identified, and this may consist of any inferences drawn from data for profiling purposes. Section 2(A) of the bill states very clearly that it applies to any personal data gathered within the territory of India by the State, any Indian company, any Indian citizen or persons, or body of persons created under Indian law. This brings call recordings within the purview of this legislation.This position can be coupled with the right to privacy discussion in the Puttaswamy judgement. The right to privacy has been described as an essential part of human dignity and a natural right. Further, the bench elaborated on the need for a data protection law to address privacy concerns. It can be interpreted that individuals, like you and us, have certain rights over any data that is related to us or can be traced back to us.When we indulge in any telephonic conversation, we do so to convey some information to the person on the other end. The nature of information being shared can range from generic to personal conversations, including sensitive personal data as given defined under Section 3(36) of the bill. Inevitably, such conversations will be considered as personal data, and they can be related back to the person who shared information on the call. There is no reason as to why the person who is recording a conversation shall have no obligation to maintain the confidentiality of information shared on the call. This would include not storing it without taking consent or at least informing the participant(s) before the recording is initiated.Most of the phone calls we have are between two individuals. Through the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, 2000, Canada puts an obligation on organizations within its country to inform the individuals when a call is recorded along with the reason as to why the call is being recorded. However, when an individual is recording a call, there is no such obligation.In the United States, the federal laws require that at least one of the parties must be aware of call recording and it can be the party recording the conversation itself. When only one party is required to have the knowledge of a conversation being recorded, it is called one-way consent. When all the parties are required to have the knowledge of a conversation being recorded, it is called two-way consent. Certain states in the U.S. such as California, Florida, Washington, among others, require all the parties to a conversation to have the knowledge of their call being recorded.In the United Kingdom, a conversation may be recorded without taking consent from the other party, but such recordings may only be used for personal purposes. If these recordings are shared with any third party, such an act is punishable under the existing U.K. laws, including the Data Protection Act of 2018. While in Australia and Germany, the concept of two-way consent is strictly followed, and calls cannot be recorded without prior consent.Incorporating two-way consent in the Indian legal system can profoundly influence the admissibility of call recordings in a court of law.According to Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, electronic records produced for the inspection of a court are considered as documentary evidence. Electronic records are admissible as per Section 65A and 65B of the same act. Due to these provisions, call recordings are admissible in a court of law. As far as Indian perspective is concerned, the honourable Supreme Court has set certain guidelines for admissibility of call records in a court of law. However, none of those guidelines require consent for recording in the first place.Further, the party who has been recorded may not be notified that such a record exists. If a call recording is presented before a court, the other party to the call may take a defence that the statement was recorded against his will and without his consent. Such a piece of evidence is against the fundamental principles of Article 20 and Article 20(3) as it is along the lines of self-incrimination. This may also be considered as a violation of the right to remain silent.(For more details on this, please check Nandini Satpathy v. Dani (P.L.) & Anr (1978 AIR 1025) and Ram Singh & Ors v. Col. Ram Singh (1986 AIR 3))Additionally, the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 seeks to recognize the right to be forgotten. By this right, an individual will have the right to restrict his personal data from being disclosed. Certain conditions decide whether stored data is personal or not. Recording a conversation and storing it without the knowledge of other parties plainly puts it at the risk of being disclosed to third parties. We believe that the authorities need to have guidelines regarding call recording between two individuals or any individual and an entity wherein consent, or at least prior caveat, is mandatory. The applications that provide call recording and related features must be directed to incorporate a notification to be sent to all the parties whenever one of the participants starts recording a call. Further, the call recording applications need to be outlawed and removed from being accessible to the general public. Moreover, the courts need to explicitly set the requirements to prove that there was consent or the other party was at least made aware that the call is being recorded before any conversation ensues.It is not a hidden fact that individuals divulge into personal conversations over phone calls concerning a myriad of their personal and professional issues. A party, revealing such information, places a certain level of confidence to the other party on the call. When confidence is placed on a legal entity, it cannot be without imposing a duty to respect that confidence. Freely available applications and openly advertised features are glaring examples of infringement of rights. Such violations are being ignored by the very people whose rights are being affected.This article has been jointly written by Prakarsh and Shruti Mishra.

    "headline": "Regulating the Dark Web: Challenges & Opportunities",
    "data": "Regulating the Dark Web: Challenges & OpportunitiesCyble, a cyber intelligence firm, recently reported that more than 1 lakh copies of Indian national ID cards such as PAN, Aadhaar, and Passport are available for sale on the dark web. Before this, the same company found a seller claiming to share data of 4.75 crore Indian Truecaller users for a total of $1000. While the selling of personal information on the dark web is one thing, one of the worst virtual vices in the present society is proliferation of child sexual abuse material (CSAM)/child pornography (CP).Dark web is accessed through the Tor browser which is readily available for downloading across various platforms. While ISPs can identify if an individual is using the Tor browser, freely available VPN services further help individuals hide their activities. There are many reports wherein dark web-based websites have been taken down as they were facilitating copyright violation, selling drugs and guns, distribution of CSAM/CP content, hackers for hire, etc. While all these actions are indeed punishable by the law, it is only possible when a perpetrator is actually caught.If I am using dark web, does it mean that I am free to do anything?As of now, no country has concrete policies about regulating dark web. In this article, we explore the possibilities and challenges we would need to deal with.The ever-green defence to a regulation seeking to control internet usage of individuals is the violation of fundamental rights. As far as India is concerned, the Kerala High Court was the first court to recognise internet access as a fundamental right and the Supreme Court held the same recently.Considering the essential nature of the internet in our daily lives, it is next to impossible to lay down blanket restrictions. Accessing the dark web is not a crime, and there is no reason why it should be. Any legislation seeking to regulate access to the dark web must be substantiated by guidelines and a reasonable cause to minimise the chances of being struck down or held unconstitutional.The next challenge would be Virtual Private Networks (VPNs). These days, using VPNs has become a common practice for many as it allows you to securely access the internet with increased privacy. Using a VPN is different than changing the number plate on a stolen car to avoid getting caught. While there is nothing inherently illegitimate about it, one might ask questions such as:Why would an ordinary person need to hide his internet history from getting tracked?Irrespective of such questions, we do not see a foreseeable future where VPNs are banned in India. Other challenges that we might encounter are lack of infrastructure and appropriate regulation of internet service providers (ISPs). If the Central Government decides to take an authoritative step, they might find it hard to justify the reasonability of such actions. This, however, does not mean that we should let the whole thing go unchecked. NCRB reports clearly show that cyber crimes are rapidly increasing in India year on year.A comprehensive legislative policy is the only way to keep a check on the illegal activities happening on the dark web. It is believed that the internet we access in our day-to-day lives is just the tip of the iceberg. While it seems not-so-feasible for a single country to regulate the dark web, India can definitely control how its citizens access the dark web.For VPNs, India does not have any dedicated law or relevant provisions. While countries like Iraq, Turkmenistan, and Belarus have completely banned VPN services, countries like the UAE, Russia, and China have restricted access to VPN services. In the UAE, only banks and similar organisations can use VPN while it is highly restricted for personal use. For China and Russia, only government-approved VPN services can be used. This totally defeats the idea of having a VPN service in the first place.We suggest that India may implement a similar regime where freely available and unchecked VPN services may be banned. However, the government may create an authority for mandatory registration of VPN service providers. Such an authority may be regulated under Chapter VI of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Considering the number of authorities we already have, it is also suggested that a sub-committee can be formed within an existing statutory body.Whether ISPs take any action or report to appropriate authorities when they detect any malpractice is highly questionable. An obligation can be placed on the ISPs by issuing guidelines to set up an additional team for filtering or isolating suspicious user activity. Based on the collected data, they can create a report. Here, we suggest that no user information should be disclosed except their IP address.This report can be forwarded to a designated government/law enforcement unit which can put such users under the watch list for a specific period. In case a user is availing VPN service, the government may ask the service provider to decrypt the user’s activity under the ambit of Section 69 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Section 69 empowers the government to issue directions for interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource. Depending upon the offence and its gravity, he may be prosecuted and barred from using VPN services for a specific period. We believe that even a rudimentary application of such policies will act like oil in the rusted wheels of India’s position concerning cyber crimes on the dark web.A 2017 Symantec report ranked India third among the nations facing most cyber threats. In 2019, a consumer tech review firm ranked India 15th out of 60 countries among least cyber secure countries. A report by safeandsecureiot.com found that New Delhi is one of the cities that draw most cyber attacks. While these statistics are indeed concerning, policy discussions around VPN services and dark web are rare in India. Cyber crimes happening on the dark web are nothing short of a criminal underworld. The worst part is that VPN services and dark web can be accessed by any individual with a smartphone and decent internet connection – this would be approximately half a billion individuals. Dark web is a constant threat that needs to be addressed. It is time for Indian stakeholders to take heed of the same. Otherwise, as Benjamin Franklin once said,By failing to prepare, you are preparing to fail.This article has been jointly written by Prakarsh and Shruti Mishra.

    "headline": "Scrapping of Section 66A: Granting a right and preventing its misuse",
    "data": "Scrapping of Section 66A: Granting a right and preventing its misuseThe Supreme Court’s judgement in Shreya Singhal v. Union of India is considered as a landmark judgement that upheld the right to free speech and struck down Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Was this really a victory for free speech? Taking a closer look at the existing cyber laws in India, one might feel that the honourable court neglected the fact that Section 66A was needed to address the undermining of human rights and dignity done in the name of free speech on social media platforms.This petition had come up before the court following the arrest of two girls in Maharashtra in November 2012, for commenting on some Facebook posts that talked about possible shut-down in Mumbai owing to the death of the Shiv Sena chief Bal Thackeray. The arrest triggered outrage and dissatisfaction over the application of Section 66A. The challenge before the court was that Section 66A provided for broad parameters allowing whimsical and unreasonable interpretation and understanding by law enforcement agencies.Another major problem the court highlighted was a lack of definitions in the Information Technology Act, 2000 to minimize the vagueness in this provision. The petitioner argued that the scope of this provision goes far beyond the allowed “reasonable restrictions” on freedom of speech and expression. After hearing the arguments from both the sides, the Supreme Court struck down the provision in its entirety. The court held that the terms used were undefined, making the statute void on the ground of vagueness. It also held that it was capable of severely encroaching upon the freedom of speech and expression.The social media needs control; restrictions on what people post and share are very much needed. A balance must be made between ‘granting a right’ and ‘avoiding its misuse’. According to the data published by the National Crime Records Bureau (NCRB), 1491 cases were pending under Section 66A in 2014. The striking down of this provision may be termed as a necessity because the lack of guiding principles had given police authorities’ broad discretionary powers to determine the veracity and severity of allegations regarding the content. Section 66A prescribed a punishment up to 3 years with a fine for:sending any information that is grossly offensive or has menacing charactersending false information, to cause annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill willsending electronic mail/message for causing annoyance or inconvenience or deceive/mislead the recipientThe provision may have been vague and unclear on certain terms like the word ‘annoyance’, but it was a tool to curb and control offensive content on social media platforms. At times, continuously receiving offensive messages through social media platforms may push an individual into depression or bring in suicidal tendencies. On the other hand, such actions might be defendable under the guise of free speech. Considering the number of internet users increasing continuously in India, and the NCRB data available, this provision provided a genuine opportunity for the victims to seek available remedies. While it gave arbitrary powers to the law enforcement agencies, striking it down took away a remedy that users like us had.Some might argue that the court struck down this provision without appreciating the fact that the actual fault lies within the laws about arrest in India. This section had always been considered to be wrongly interpreted because of the misuse of powers by the police, who failed to differentiate between harmless free speech and genuinely offensive statement due to lack of guiding principles.While Section 66A has been scrapped, we need a law to implement the right to free speech and expression on the internet, but on workable and practical grounds. The distinction must be established between free speech and speech intended to cause criminal intimidation to an internet user. While there is no Section 66A right now, Section 499, 506, and 509 are relevant provisions under which a complaint can be filed.At the same time, it is crucial to accept that the internet has provided a platform for the perpetrators to commit new forms of technology-based crimes. Section 66A indeed had anomalies, but it provided for a suitable remedy in cases where communal/religious harmony was disrupted by the transmission of offensive content. With Section 66A declared as unconstitutional, genuine victims have no other option than to file a complaint under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.Considering the diverse nature of Indian population and free speech being susceptible to abuse on political, religious, and communal grounds, the authors believe that we are not ready yet to have an uncontrolled and unrestrained right to free speech. A line has to be drawn.Reports published by NCRB in the last five years clearly suggest that cyber crimes are rapidly increasing in India. Without Section 66A in place, the police have become a toothless tiger. Even if we do not have a 66A, we need a provision which is specific and thoroughly covers the problem that 66A aimed to cover. The ball is now in the Parliament’s court, and it remains to be seen whether a similar provision is incorporated in any upcoming amendments.Provisions of law are vulnerable to misuse and manipulation. The mere prospect of abuse cannot be a ground for removing a provision in its totality. While we have seen various instances of special law prevailing over general law, there is no provision in the Information Technology Act, 2000 under which remedy can be sought if a message/post/email is merely offensive, neither obscene nor sexually explicit. Instead of declaring the entire provision as unconstitutional, it could have been read down along with issuing guidelines for police officials while dealing with cases involving Section 66A. Considering the fact that the right to free speech aligns with the duty to protect one’s reputation, the Shreya Singhal case was an excellent opportunity to bring out a workable distinction between the protection of fundamental rights in cyber space and reasonably restricting them at the same time.This article has been jointly written by Shivangi Pandia and Prateek Charan.

    "headline": "A Beginner’s Guide to Cryptography",
    "data": "Cryptography has been derived from the Greek word kryptos, which means hidden. It involves converting information in a manner that it can only be read and processed by the intended receivers. Crypt means hidden and graphy means writing. One of the earliest instances of cryptography is traced back to the use of Hieroglyph in which scribes used to encode/decode the messages on behalf of the kings. In our ever-evolving cyber space where attacks are getting more and more sophisticated, cryptography is considered as one of the most efficient solutions to minimize the overall security risk.Modern cryptography is concerned with four security objectives:Confidentiality: Only the expected receiver of an encoded message should be able to decode and retrieve the message contents.Integrity: When data is stored or transmitted, it must not be modified. Hashing is a well-known method to check data integrity.Authentication: It identifies whether an individual or system is who they are claiming to be.Non-repudiation: It ensures that a party cannot deny their signature or the authenticity of the message they sent.Symmetric Key Cryptography: In symmetric key cryptography, the sender and receiver use a shared secret (common key) for encryption and decryption of a message. At times, it is also referred to as private or secret-key cryptography. As compared to asymmetry key cryptography, symmetric algorithms are faster. One of the most significant issues in symmetric key systems is the sharing of the common key when a sender and receiver are communicating for the first time. Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) are examples of symmetric key systems.Asymmetric Key Cryptography: In asymmetric key cryptography, every user has a pair of keys called private key and public key. This pair of keys are mathematically related to each other such that a message encrypted using a receiver’s public key can only be decrypted by the said receiver’s corresponding private key. As the names suggest, public keys can be shared with anybody while the private key shall not be shared with anybody. Also known as public key cryptography, asymmetric algorithms are considered to be more secure than their symmetric counterparts.Section 2(1)(f) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 defines “asymmetric crypto system” as a system of a secure key pair consisting of a private key for creating a digital signature and a public key to verify the digital signature. Key pair, private key, and public key are defined under Section 2(1)(x), 2(1)(zc), and 2(1)(zd) respectively.1. DESData Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric algorithm and as we discussed earlier, it uses the same key for encryption and decryption. It is a block cipher algorithm that uses a 64-bit block. This algorithm relies on Feistel structure for encryption and decryption of messages. As the standard DES algorithms can be easily cracked using modern techniques, Double DES and Triple DES algorithms are used at times. They use 112-bit and 168-bit keys, respectively.DES Algorithm (Source)2. AESAdvanced Encryption Standard (AES) is another symmetric algorithm that is six times faster than Triple DES. Like DES, AES also uses symmetric block ciphers. AES key size can be 128, 192, or 256 bits. A common application of AES is to prevent man-in-the-middle attack when files are shared over HTTP. As of now, there does not appear to be any computationally feasible ways to crack this algorithm. However, in 2009, it was shown that AES-192 and AES-256 can be broken by attacks that require 2176 and 2119 time, respectively.AES Algorithm (Source)3. RSARSA stands for Rivest, Shamir, and Adleman. It is an example of asymmetric cryptography algorithm that was introduced in 1978. The main idea behind RSA is the fact that it is hard to factories a large number. A public key in RSA is calculated by multiplying two prime numbers and similar calculations are done for calculating private key. RSA is commonly used for digital signatures.RSA Algorithm (Source)4. Diffie-HellmanThe perfect application of this algorithm is when two parties, that do not previously know each other, have to establish a secure communication channel between themselves. It is difficult to classify this algorithm as either symmetric or asymmetric as it uses key pairs in the key exchange process while symmetric cryptography is evident when the shared secret is used in the communication process.Diffie-Hellman Algorithm (Source)Digital signatures are a way of ensuring the authenticity of electronic documents or records. By using a digital signature, a receiver verifies that the received document has not been tampered with by an unauthorised user. There is no doubt in saying that digital signatures are equivalent to handwritten signatures and stamped seals. In India, Section 3 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 recognises digital signatures and describe the process of authentication of electronic records using digital signatures as:The authentication of the electronic record shall be effected by the use of asymmetric crypto system and hash function which envelop and transform the initial electronic record into another electronic record.Digital signature has been defined in Section 2(1)(p) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. For digital signatures to work, public key infrastructure (PKI) is a mandatory prerequisite. Consider that there are two users: ABC and XYZ.Digital Signature (Source)When ABC has to send a document to XYZ, ABC will first generate a hash for this document. If the document is modified in any manner, the hash value will change. The generated hash is encrypted using ABC’s private key and the encrypted text is sent to XYZ. Upon receiving, XYZ will generate its own hash and decrypt ABC’s hash using ABC’s private key. Both these hashes are compared, and if they match, the sender is authenticated and the message has not been modified.This article has been written by Ishika Jain, an undergraduate student at DIT University, Dehradun, during her internship with The Cyber Blog India in June/July 2020.With contributions from Raj Pagariya.Featured Image Credits: Background vector created by starline – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "Is the new wallpaper that crashes Android phones a malware?",
    "data": "By this time, you must have heard about this wallpaper that crashes Android phones, right? If you haven’t, join the clout. Here’s the image for you:Is the new wallpaper that crashes Android phones a malware?The above image, when directly downloaded from Google Images, causes Android phones (including Google Pixel phones) to crash.Before we go into technical details of this picture, let’s try to understand what is malware. It is an umbrella term for malicious software and includes virus, trojan, ransomware, keyloggers, spyware, adware, worms, etc. Computer systems and mobile devices alike can be infected by malware.Depending upon the type of malware, the exact motive may vary. However, the common ground between all of them is that they all are developed with the intent to destroy and destruct. But, why is this important in the context of this picture?Once this image is set as a wallpaper, an Android phone crashes which leads one to believe that the image creator may have malicious intent. Though some mobile phones can be rebooted and used in safe mode after the crash, certain mobile phones have not been able to recover. In such a situation, it becomes reasonable to think that there is some code embedded in the image that has caused the phone to crash.If you take the screenshot of this image and set it as wallpaper, the phone does not crash. Generally, malware spreads through email attachments, free drive-by downloads, and malicious links. While in the case of this image, users are voluntarily downloading the image without any external influence. If the image had been malware altogether, the phone would have crashed as soon the image was downloaded and opened. If you think it from an attacker’s perspective, why would they wait for the user to set the image as wallpaper when they can crash the phone as soon as the image is downloaded?After doing a bit of reverse image search, the original source of this image can be located here. If you see the image properties, it shows that image has been taken from a Nikon D850 camera. The colour space and colour profile are RGB and ProPhoto RGB respectively.Every mobile device has its own capability with respect to the composition of RGB colours it can display. And this is exactly the reason for the crash.RGB Range Components (taken from gballard.net)If you see colour space for different colour profiles given above, the smallest triangle in the right-hand side is what Android-based mobile phones are capable of. Adobe RGB and ProPhoto RGB are wider colour spaces that are not supported by Android phones. As we saw above, the colour profile for this image is ProPhoto RGB which is beyond the capabilities of Android phones.An android phone’s display works on the following formula0.2126 * Red + 0.7152* Green + 0.0722 * BlueThis formula for proportionate division of RGB colours is based on how quickly human eyes notice a colour. The maximum value that can be derived from this formula for Android phones is approximately 255.For all the pixels in this image except one, the value is less than 255. However, for one particular pixel, R is 255, G is 255, and B is 243. When these values are put into the above formula, we get= 255 * 0.2126 + 255 * 0.7152 * 255 * 0.0722Considering that Android components round off each component value before finally adding them,= 55 + 183 + 18= 256As this value goes beyond 255, Android phones are crashing.Most probably, this image is not a piece of malware. Note the most probably here because nothing can be said absolutely while talking about cyber security. This round-off of component value leads to a crash and it is definitely one of the latest known shortcomings of Android phones, including Google Pixel phones. While this incident was initially reported, there was a lot of fake news being shared. I hope that this article clarifies what is exactly happening.To receive regular updates from our WhatsApp Helpline, drop a message with your name and city here: +91 9340337396.Join our Telegram channel here: https://t.me/incyberblog."

    "headline": "COVID-19 and Cyber Crimes Against Women",
    "data": "COVID-19 and Cyber Crimes Against WomenThe traditional Indian society had treated women with great respect, Vedas puffed up her as a mother, creator, and addressed her as Devi or Goddess. Occupying a vital role, any mistreatment or subjugation to her dignity was seen as derogatory, not only for her but for the whole society. But a few millenniums later, the same does not appear to be the case.While the world is battling COVID-19 pandemic, we can straightforwardly note that the expansion of the internet and the increasing number of internet users have directly contributed to the increment in crimes against women in cyber space. Cyber crime can be simply understood as any illegal activity that uses a computer as a means or a facilitator for the commission of an offence. However, this is not a watertight definition as cyber criminals continue to evolve boulevard to target the victims in new ways.When we talk about prosecuting such perpetrators, we have the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the good-old Indian Penal Code, 1860. Even though they are supported by a variety of other laws, they do not provide a stringent solution to deal with cyber crimes against women effectively.Cyber Stalking: When a man follows a woman, contacts, or attempts to contact a woman over the internet to initiate personal interaction even after the woman has clearly shown disinterest or monitors a woman’s use of the internet is referred to as cyber stalking.Cyber Pornography: It refers to distributing, creating, editing, publishing, or sharing sexually explicit content.Morphing: When a perpetrator edits a victim’s picture without her permission to depict her in a compromising position, the pictures are said to be morphed. Morphing is often followed by blackmailing the victim and ask for unwanted sexual favours.Online Harassment: Often perceived as an umbrella term for referring to a variety of cyber crimes happening on the internet, it includes message bombing, threats, defamatory content, unwanted favours, etc.Voyeurism: When a picture or video of a woman is captured/recorded while she is engaged in a private act, under the impression that she is not being observed by any person, is called as voyeurism.Online Defamation: Defamation is any statement that is not true. When defamatory statements, posts, pictures, comments, etc. are posted on online platforms, such acts fall under the category of online defamation.It is very hard to segregate certain types of cyber crimes as constituent acts involved in one type may be overlapping with acts involved in another type. Nevertheless, at present, the following provisions are relevant when we discuss cyber crimes against women.According to the National Commission for Women, 54 complaints related to cyber crime were received during the first lockdown in India with an increase in cases of ‘sextortion’ which is a form of virtually blackmailing the victim to post her intimate pictures online if the victim refuses to meet the demands of the blackmailer or give in to the unwanted favours.Even after considering The Cyber Blog India’s limited reach, the average number of victims contacting us per day has gone up by at least 250% after lockdown came into force. This trend is also visible in the cases involving female victims. On similar lines, many organisations like us have reported an increased number of female victims contacting them for help and support.The increasing number of cyber crimes against women is not a problem that is limited to India only. A survey of more than 9000 German Internet users (between 10 to 15 years of age) indicated that women were more vulnerable to cyber crimes like online sexual harassment and cyber stalking than men. As per the survey by Pew Research Centre in US, women belonging to 18 to 24 years of age disproportionately experience cyber harassment.These surveys illustrate a bitter truth; cyber crime is more dreadful and catastrophic for women than men.It is believed that with work from home and being confined to limited physical space, the average screen time has sharply increased. Further, the CSC e-Governance Services has noted an increase in the use of data services from 2.7 TB (March 10) to 4.7 TB (March 30). While discussing cyber crime against women, it is also important to note that 70% of internet users in India were male while only 30% were females in 2017. It is estimated that this difference will reduce and gender-wise user distribution will stand at 60% for males and 40% for females in 2020.We would like to make the following suggestions for preventing cyber crime against women:Creating awareness through programs and campaigns, online as well as offline, covering good security practices, existing laws, and remedies for cyber crime victimsEstablishing an ecosystem of concerned stakeholders that ensure that such cases are reported, investigated, and prosecuted swiftlyFormulating and implementing a policy for preventing the disclosure of victims’ identity in such casesConducting qualitative and quantitative research to understand the problems faced by victims and devising appropriate solutionsIt has to be understood that irrespective of how stringent laws are made with respect to cyber crimes against women, the best action plan for women is to start reporting such incidents. It is time to move on from the casual block and ignore method to report so that cyber crimes do not go unreported anymore.This article has been written by Sherry Shukla & Arpit Lahoti.

    "headline": "Do grandparents require parental consent to post photos of their minor grandchildren online?",
    "data": "Consent plays a key component of any data protection and privacy legislation. It has been very well defined in the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). Before we discuss further, it is important to note that GDPR is considered as one of the most stringent data protection laws across the globe.Consent of a data subject means any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data related to him or her. For the sake of clarity, a data subject is an individual whose data is being processed. (You can read more about this in Article 4 of GDPR.)Article 8(1) of GDPR states that a consent given by a data subject will only be considered as lawful if the said data subject is more than 16 years of age. In cases involving children below the age of 16 years, the consent will only be considered lawful if it is given or authorised by an individual holding parental responsibility for a child.So, it is clear here that for individuals that have not attained the age of 16 years, consent must be given by their parents or legal guardians. On these premises, do you think it would be unlawful for a grandparent to post pictures of their grandchildren who are minors without taking consent from the parents?Do grandparents require parental consent to post photos of their minor grandchildren online?Generally, one would presume that GDPR will not be applicable for storing pictures by family members. However, in May 2020, a grandmother was asked to take down photos of her three grandchildren that she uploaded on Facebook and Pinterest. According to a local news report, the children’s mother requested her mother to take down the pictures multiple times before she approached the court.The children’s mother requested the court to impose a hefty fine of €250. The court ordered the grandmother to take down all the pictures within ten days; otherwise, she will have to pay a fine of €50 per day. Further, the same fine will be applicable if the grandmother posts pictures of her grandchildren without the consent of their mother.Though the grandmother submitted before the concerned court that she had removed a majority of photos from Facebook and Pinterest; but she wanted to have at least one photo on both the platforms. The court denied this request stating that the permission from the children’s mother had not been taken.This is the first question that struck me when I read about this incident. After doing a bit of research and going through the details of this case, I found that since the photos were published on platforms such as Facebook and Pinterest, they were not limited to a small circle of family members. As soon as they were uploaded, they were available in the public domain. The court referred to one of its rulings given earlier this year wherein it stated thatOn Facebook, it cannot be ruled out that placed photos could be distributed and that they may come into the hands of third parties.Though GDPR is not applicable to either purely personal or household processing of personal data, this ruling is bound to make social media users think twice before uploading pictures of their friends or family members. While we are yet to have a dedicated data protection and privacy legislation in India, the proposed Indian Personal Data Protection Bill derives substantial inspirations from GDPR. A couple of years down the line, we might see similar instances in India.Featured Image Credits: Camera vector created by brgfx – www.freepik.com"

    "headline": "No! Indians are not watching “disturbing amount” of CSAM during lockdown",
    "data": "Several reputed media houses including Vice, Times of India, The Week, Hindustan Times etc. reported about an alleged 95% or 200% increase in the demand for child sexual abuse material (CSAM) during the COVID lockdown in India. While I have written several accounts of investigations into the proliferation of child sexual abuse material on platforms in India, such findings are starker and nothing like before, especially during the lockdown period. Preliminary research about the lockdown and prevalence of demand for CSAM indicates that there is no evidence to say that there has been such a huge increase in demand of child sexual abuse material during the lockdown in India. The numbers in these articles have been quoted incorrectly and out of context. The ICPF report presents PornHub statistics as evidence for an increase in demand for CSAM with a claim that a “significant segment of this spike can be attributed to the demand for child pornography content.” Although statistics from PornHub do reveal that there was a 95% increase in traffic from India on March 27th (from under 25% levels in the previous days), there is no claim by PornHub that such increase was due to demand of Child Sexual Abuse Material. In fact, there was a global increase in PornHub’s traffic, as high as 24% when the company announced making its premium content free for all. When a similar announcement for free premium content was made in Italy, the average daily traffic change of under 10% soared up to 57%, in Spain from roughly the same levels to 62% and in France from under 6% to 38%. The causal link between an increase in traffic on a website with demand for CSAM is not well-founded. Further, the ICPF report talks about an increase in searches for keywords such as “child porn” and “sexy child” in India. I do not have access to PornHub’s search histories because it is not publicly available data but data from Google search trends suggests that there has not been any unusual spike in searches for the keywords mentioned in ICPF’s report between the time period of March 24-26th. In fact, after news reports about ICPF’s research were published, there can be seen a steep increase in search for those keywords like never before in the last three months.Google Search Trends for CSAMThe 200% increase in demand (which has been irresponsibly quoted by Vice and not rectified despite being informed) has been reported by the Indian Child Protection Fund (ICPF)’s study from December 2019, during a deterrence project undertaken by them against Child Sexual Abuse Material in India. This figure is being misquoted by media houses as happening during the lockdown, of which there is no public evidence available. It has been reported by ICPF how the prevalence of search for child sexual abuse material through specific keywords on the public web changed during that period by 200%. They have also reported that they sent deterrence messages to around 5 lakh perpetrators of CSAM through Google, Facebook, and Instagram. It is my understanding that ICPF used proprietary technology tools to undertake the project but without the data sets being made available from ICPF, we are not in a position to verify the claims.Note: ICPF has informed us that they cannot share the data sets given the sensitivity of the matter.As for an increase in demand for CSAM during the lockdown is concerned, I have not found any direct evidence to conclude that might be the case. I am however aware of the fact that there have been increased incidents and the threats that children face every day have also increased amid the lockdown because everyone is leading their lives online for the most part. To highlight, incidents of indecent messaging to children and women along with unsolicited exposure to sensitive content has increased. Like ECPAT, UN and Europol, I too believe that children face more threats during these times and strong actions or deterrence along with building resilience and safety nets need to be taken."

    "headline": "Admissibility of WhatsApp Chats in a Court of Law",
    "data": "Technology has become an integral part of our daily lives. Over the years, we have seen how internet-based services are being used in committing a crime. On the premises that WhatsApp has become a verb, I will be discussing the admissibility of WhatsApp Chats in a court of law.Section 2(1)(t) of the Information Technology Act, 2000 defines an electronic record as data, record, or data generated, image or sound stored, received or sent in an electronic form or microfilm or computer-generated microfiche.Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 defines evidence as all documents including electronic records produced for the inspection of the court. All such documents are considered as documentary evidence.Here, it is clearly evident that electronic records produced before the court will be considered as documentary evidence. For such an electronic record to be admissible, it must not have been tampered with or modified. For this, Section 65A of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 states that contents of an electronic record may be provided in accordance with the requirements specified in Section 65B. Briefly, the requirements given under Section 65B can be summarised into the following bullet points:The evidence must be stored in the computer when it is being used regularly for the purpose of storage and it must be used by a person who is lawfully in possession of the computer.The content of the evidence must be fed in it during regular usage or activities performed by the computer.The computer must be fully operational and in a good condition, if not then it must be provable in the court that the evidence has not been tampered with and is in a presentable condition before the court.The evidence must be presented in the court as it was originally extracted during the regular course of operation of the system.Admissibility of WhatsApp Chats in a Court of LawIn the case of Girwar Singh v. CBI, electronic evidence was presented before the court and a committee was appointed to check the authenticity of the electronic evidence. The committee found that the evidence wasn’t the original one or the copy of the original. The evidence was copied multiple times in various devices. Hence, the Delhi HC held the electronic evidence as inadmissible in the court.Here, it must be noted that the exhibition of evidence which has been reproduced from an original document is known as secondary evidence. Section 63 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 lays down various instances when a piece of evidence is considered as secondary evidence. On the other hand, Section 62 of the same act defines primary evidence as a document presented in its original form for the inspection of the court. This leads to a pertinent question: whether WhatsApp chats will be considered as primary or secondary evidence?In the landmark case of Anvar v. P.K Baseer & Ors, the Supreme Court of India answered all the controversies which were created regarding the admissibility of electronic records in the court. In this case, the honourable Supreme Court made it clear that the requirements given under Section 65B are mandatory. The court also clarified that Section 63 and 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 do not apply to secondary evidence in the form of electronic evidence. As far as electronic evidence is concerned, only Section 65A and 65B are relevant.In 2018, this judgement was overruled in the case of Shafi Mohammed v. State of HP, wherein the Supreme Court relaxed the mandatory requirements under Section 65B and stated that electronic evidence presented without a certificate under Section 65B(4) can be relied upon. In cases when an electronic device, which produced an electronic record, is not in the possession of a party presenting the evidence, requirements of Section 65(4) cannot be fulfilled. At the same time, there must be no denial of justice to such parties and the court must relax this procedural requirement if the interests of justice so satisfy.In the case of Vikas Garg & Ors. v. State of Haryana (2017), the trial court relied on WhatsApp chats to hold the accused guilty of rape, among other offences. Later, the Supreme Court stayed the High Court’s order for bail and as per the latest information available, the Special Leave Petition is pending before the honourable court.Later in 2018, a division bench of the Delhi High Court dismissed an appeal against the acquittal of accused by the trial court for offences under Section 376 and 506 of the Indian Penal Code, 1850. The bench considered WhatsApp chats between the parties which were duly admitted by the prosecutrix in cross-examination. The court was of the view that the chat contents demonstrate that the prosecutrix has consented for a physical relationship out of her free will and without any inducement.Recently in January 06, 2020, the honourable Supreme Court granted an injunction under Section 36 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963 in the case of Ambalal Sarabhai Enterprise Ltd. v. KS Infraspace, LLP Ltd. The court held that WhatsApp messages, which are considered as virtual communication, are capable of being considered as evidence. Before the consideration, the meaning and content of the virtual communication must be proved through evidence-in-chief and cross-examination during the trial.ConclusionAs a matter of practice over the last few years, we have observed that WhatsApp chats, or communication happening over any social media or instant messaging platforms for that case, are submitted in the form of print outs of actual chats. This practice clearly takes WhatsApp chats out of the scope of Section 62 and they cannot be considered as primary evidence. But what will happen if the mobile device which has the actual conversation (the original copy of a WhatsApp chat) is presented before a court? It would definitely make a strong ground to be considered as primary evidence. While the jurisprudence on electronic evidence is still in its nascent stage even after twenty years since the Information Technology Act, 2000 came into force, we expect to see major developments on this subject-matter in the next five years."

    "headline": "Digital Justice System in India: Overview & Recent Trends",
    "data": "Digital Justice System in India: Overview & Recent TrendsBack in 2005, the need for re-engineering the processes of Indian Judiciary was felt in order to make optimum utilization of the human resources and to change the system of data management by utilizing Information and Communication Technology (ICT) to its fullest extent. It can’t be denied that justice should be accessible, affordable, cost-effective, accountable and transparent. Therefore, ICT was regarded as a major weapon which could enhance the productivity of the Indian Judiciary. Hence, the then Chief Justice of India, Yogesh Kumar Sabharwal, made a proposal for the constitution of an e-committee which would assist him to formulate a policy on digitalisation of the Indian Judiciary and advise him on matters related to technology, communication and data management. The e-committee accordingly prepared a report on ‘Strategic Plan for Implementation of Information and Communication Technology in Indian Judiciary’ in the same year. The report had detailed discussions with research and development experts and service providers to ascertain the status of technology in the present times and its advantages in the proceedings of the court, availability, security, implementation, and support systems.The proposal was to implement the plan in three phases over a period of five years. The main objectives of the plan were to provide assistance to judicial administration in streaming the day to day activities, to help in reducing the pendency of the cases, to ensure transparency of information and make the judicial databases accessible to the judges. However, it remained questionable whether the implementation of this plan would be able to take place in a proper manner or not.A necessity was felt to avoid delay in the process of serving and consequent piling up of arrears. Hence, the facility of serving court notices through e-mail was extended in addition to the normal modes of services existing in the Supreme Court Rules. This basic facility which should have been promulgated in 2005 itself, was initiated in a case of 2010 despite the period of 5 years that were allotted for the purpose of digitalising justice delivery system.In the case of Dasam Vijay Rama Rao (2015), the High Court of Telangana held that the family courts are justified in seeking the assistance of a lawyer who would provide the necessary Skype facility in any particular case. The parties were therefore permitted to be represented by a practitioner who can bring a mobile device through which the parties staying abroad can be enquired about the free will and consent besides being identified by the family court. This facility would reduce the litigation costs and save the valuable time of the court, thereby ensuring speedy justice.In the case of State of Maharashtra v. Chandrabhan Sudam Sanap (2018), the High Court of Bombay recognized the significance of taking evidence through video conferencing by describing the process of taking evidence via electronic means and explaining it further:“The accused and his pleader can see the witness as clearly as if the witness was actually sitting before them. In fact, the accused may be able to see the witness better than he may have been able to if he was sitting in the dock in a crowded courtroom.”Hence, the objective of Section 273 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 viz. that the evidence be recorded in the presence of the accused was also satisfied. It was also added that the facility of playback would give an added advantage whilst cross-examining.Considering that we are still exploring the possibilities of a digital justice system in India, it is clear that the 2005 proposal was not implemented in the manner it should have been. A major development on this subject-matter came in the case of Shafhi Mohammad v. State of Himachal Pradesh (2018)  The main issue, in this case, was the admissibility of electronic evidence. After the landmark judgment of Anvar v. Bashir (2014), the requirement of a certificate under Section 65B(4) of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 was made mandatory stating the reason that the special law prevails over the general law and subsequently, it was relied upon extensively in many cases brought before the honourable Supreme Court and the High Courts.The division bench, in this case, stated that the requirement of a certificate under Section 65B (4) was procedural and not mandatory. The matter was regarding the use of videography in the investigation process. It was already recognized in previous cases that statements could be recorded via Skype and video conferencing could be done in criminal trials, etc., but its significance in the investigation and other wings of the justice delivery system was not yet explored. The mandatory requirement of certificate for the admissibility of electronic records as evidence was the main concern prohibiting the optimum utilization of electronic means in the justice delivery system because a person who is not in possession of the device from which the electronic evidence was produced wouldn’t be able to produce such certificate. Hence, it was held thatthe requirement of certificate is procedural and can be relaxed by Court wherever the interests of justice so justify.Apart from this major relaxation of mandatory certificate requirement promoting the use of videography in the investigation, the Supreme Court ordered the Ministry of Home Affairs to set up a Central Oversight Body (COB) who would prepare a centrally driven action plan and to implement the use of videography in the investigation. The funding of the project would also be initiated by the Centre, though law and order is a state subject. A remarkable part of the judgment was that CCTV cameras were ordered to be installed in all police stations and prisons to check if there was any human rights abuse taking place. The compliance of the instructions would be ensured by the Secretary, Ministry of Home Affairs in the Central Government and Home Secretaries in the State Government. This was a major step taken by the Supreme Court for encouraging the digitalisation of the justice delivery system and making rules to ensure that the implementation takes place in a prudent manner.After the global pandemic hit India in January 2020, we have witnessed that the courts had no other way but to hear cases through video conferencing. It is a sad reality that it took us a global pandemic to realise the importance of a digitalised justice delivery system, though the e-committee for its implementation had been formulated long back in 2005. Had it been implemented according to the plan of 2005, the advocates, judges and other officers of the judicial system would have adapted to the digitalised system by now, and more cases would have been dealt by the Indian Courts.However, complete digitalisation of the Indian Judiciary would have some loopholes which need to be noted before talking about the digitalisation of the justice delivery system. In a recent webinar, Hon’ble Justice D Y Chandrachud who is the head of the e-committee of Supreme Court said that “Virtual courts can’t fully displace open court hearings.” In some sensitive cases where the court needs to check the demeanour of the accused or the witness (including their body language and the way they react to the questions being asked to them during cross-examination) before pronouncing the judgment, it won’t be possible for the judge to perceive those behavioural aspects through video conferencing. Though lawyers are prone to adopting the changes in the legal system as they came, it can’t be denied that many advocates need to be trained. According to Justice Chandrachud, we have to be conscious to impart training to those lawyers who might not be well-equipped with technology. The digitalised justice delivery system has also opened gates of criticism related to privacy, the answer to which has also been provided by Justice Chandrachud. There is an aspect of Case Information Software which enables the hiding of names of parties in sensitive cases ensuring that the privacy of the parties is maintained. Also, it shall be noted that since time immemorial, the system of open courts has been prevailing in India and it is perfectly within the discretion of the court whether to disclose any information or not.Justice Chandrachud also mentioned about some initiatives which are being worked upon such as the Inter-Operable Criminal Justice System (ICJS) which would be a single platform where all the metadata would be available and the National Service and Tracking of Electronic Process (NSTEP) to address the delay due to non-service of the summons along with a system for e-payment of court fees, court deposits, etc. The main aim of the ICJS is to bring an online Integrated Management Information System by connecting the data from police, prisons, forensic laboratories, and courts for ensuring speedy justice. The time taken in the exchange of paper-based documents will be saved and such a system will provide instant access of data to the stakeholders. Apart from this facility, NSTEP is an Android-based application which would be useful for the bailiffs. The step by step procedure to operate the application has been given in the user manual of NSTEP.The deployment of e-courts was an immediate decision taken by the Hon’ble Chief Justice of India, S A Bobde, to keep “access to justice” functional and meet the exigencies. Though the courts took small steps initially towards making it a digitalised justice system, but the pace at which people are adapting to the change is commendable. However, the will of the government to invest a huge amount in making the digitalisation successful remains to be a major concern. Another aspect which is yet to be explored is whether the digitalisation of the justice delivery system would snatch the employment opportunities generated by the Indian Judiciary or generate even more opportunities for the individuals involved."

    "headline": "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) for Beginners",
    "data": "California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)I am sure you would have heard that data is the new oil. Modern-day enterprises thrive on data to make business decisions. To prevent misuse of data and recognise the rights of data subjects, General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the UK Data Protection Act of 2018, and India’s Personal Data Protection Bill (PDPB) are some of the laws (or to-be laws) that seek to regulate how corporate organizations collect and process data. In this article, I will be discussing the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018.CCPA stands for the California Consumer Privacy Act. It was passed in June 2018 and came in force from January 01, 2020. It is a state-level legislation in the United States that grants a set of rights to the Californian residents. As per the latest estimates, with 39.6 million population, California is the most populous state in the USA. According to the Assembly Bill Number 375, a consumer or set of consumers can demand the entire record of data secured on them by businesses. This legislation intends to provide consumers with the answers to all questions related to their data. As per the provisions of this act, an individual can even refuse the sale of their data. The covered companies are bound to reveal all the third parties with whom they are sharing the collected data. For this act, the term “business” includes partnership, sole proprietorship, limited liability company, corporation, and association.CCPA only applies to businesses whose gross revenue exceeds $25 million and those who generate 50% of their revenue by selling the personal information of consumers. It is also applicable to the companies that either buy or process personal information of more than 50,000 devices, households, and consumers. The businesses need not be specifically based out of California for this act to be applicable.The act defines personal information asinformation that identifies, relates to, describes, is capable of being associated with, or could reasonably be linked, directly or indirectly, with a particular consumer or household.As given in CCPA, the scope of personal information includes, but is not limited to:Identifiers such as a real name, alias, postal address, unique personal identifiers, online identifiers such as IP address, email address, and account name, Social Security Number, driver’s license number, passport number, or other similar identifiersCharacteristics of protected classifications under California or federal lawCommercial information including records of personal property, products or services purchased, obtained or considered, or other purchasing or consuming histories or tendenciesBiometric informationInternet or additional electronic network activity information including, but not limited to, browsing history, search history and information regarding a consumer’s interaction with a website, application or advertisementGeolocation dataAudio, electronic, visual, thermal, olfactory or similar informationProfessional or employment-related informationEducation information, defined as information that is not publicly available personally identifiable information (PII) as defined in the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (20 USC section 1232g, 34 CFR Part 99)Inferences drawn from any of the information identified in this subdivision to create a profile about a consumer reflecting the consumer’s preferences, characteristics, psychological trends, preferences, predispositions, behaviour, attitudes, intelligence, abilities and aptitudesAs per CCPA, personal information includes unambiguous identifiers (postal address, real name, social security number), exclusive identifiers (online IP address, email address, account name), biometric information, geolocation data, internet activity (but not limited to browsing or search history), and sensitive data (consumer’s characteristics, preferences, behaviour, attitudes, educational information, medical history, employment, and financial information).Perhaps, it will be more convenient to figure out what is not personal information, than to outline what is.Personal information does not include any information which is publicly available. As far as cookies are concerned, they are used to accumulate personal data of consumers, they can be categorized under unique identifiers, as a part of personal information under CCPA. It is quite possible that the information accumulated through cookies would only include anonymised data of users. However, it can be regarded as personal data if combined with other data, used for creating user profiles or establishing device connections.Initially, this act also covered information associated with employers and employees. However, an amendment AB 25 was passed, which partially exempts the employers from abiding by the act concerning data collected “by a business in the course of the natural person acting as a job applicant to, an employee of, director of, officer of, medical staff member of, or contractor of that business.” This exemption is only going to remain in force till January 01, 2021, and hence, the businesses will still need to comply in the due course of time.Another amendment, AB 874, has been passed which intends to clarify the outlines of publicly available information, an exception to the explanation of personal information. It removes the “purpose” requirement under this exception. Consequentially, all the information available in local, state, or federal government records will be omitted from the definition of personal data and considered as the publicly available information.The Californian residents will be empowered with the right to know about the information collected about them by businesses. They will be able to get answers to questions such as:\na. Why was the data collected?\nb. What are the types of data collected?\nc. Was the data sold or shared with a third party? If yes, who?The consumers will have the liberty to refuse the businesses to sell their data. This act broadens the definition of selling data from a mere financial transaction.Californians can seek appropriate legal remedies if a business violates their rights as given under the act.Californians will be able to request the businesses to delete their personal information.To reveal the personal information collected, sold, or exposed for business activitiesTo share details about the classification of personal information and the purpose of data collectionTo facilitate access to the users in regards to their collected personal informationTo delete the collected personal information, as and when requestedTo provide a choice to the users with respect to selling their personal information to other businessesIf a user thinks that their privacy has been compromised or their rights have been violated, they can serve a legal notice to the concerned business. CCPA grants a window of thirty days to a business entity to take appropriate action. Once this duration is over and if the issue is not resolved, users can also file a class-action suit against the business.This law also provides for penalties if a business does not comply with the requirements given under the act. Non-compliance with CCPA may lead to a civil penalty for such businesses, amounting to $7500 for each violation. It also provides for a civil action to recover damages of a minimum of $100 and a maximum of $750 per consumer. It must be considered that the price for compliance is undoubtedly less than the resulting penalties due to non-compliance. In contrast, the GDPR penalizes 4% of the preceding year’s worldwide turnover or a fine up to €20 million, whichever is more.Many experts have termed CCPA as California’s GDPR. However, the introduction of CCPA cannot relinquish the EU’s data protection regulation. Both the legislations have certain stark differences between them. For example, CCPA’s definition of personal information is much more extensive than the description laid down by the GDPR.CCPA encloses nearly, all the communication happening in the cyber space, thereby bringing businesses under strict compliance requirements. However, it is believed that CCPA compliance should not be troublesome for the businesses that are already GDPR compliant.AB 375 was processed in mere seven days since the lawmakers wanted to deflect a ballot initiative. This was done primarily to clear a stringent law that was rather opposed by the tech giants. This act, prepared in just a week, comprises of various ambiguities, which makes it a challenging task to meet compliance requirement. Some key concerns include the variation in pricing of users, based on their privacy choices. Several organizations provide users with an option to elevate to paid level for avoiding advertisements. The law hereby is a bit ambiguous. When users exercise their rights under CCPA, companies cannot differ in providing services or quality of goods.However, under CCPA, companies are not barred from giving a distinct set of services to users, if that distinction is correlated to the user’s data. Therefore, it becomes a possible situation that this law will witness several amendments in due course of time. Recently on June 01, 2020, the Office of the California Attorney General has submitted a report outlining proposed changes in the act. As far as state-level legislations are concerned, CCPA seems to be just the beginning in the United States. It is expected that by 2025, a majority of US states would have enacted a law dealing with the rights of consumers with respect to their data in cyber space."

    "headline": "Internet Access: A fundamental right or a matter of government control?",
    "data": "Internet Access: A fundamental right or a matter of government control?Access to the Internet as a fundamental right was declared by the Kerala High Court in September 2019. The Supreme Court of India also backed this decision by upholding that the right to access the Internet forms an integral part of the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression. In this concern, the Supreme Court ordered the restoration of internet services in Jammu and Kashmir (‘J&K’). However, internet services have been restricted to 2G internet services since the judgement. A petition was filed by ‘Foundation for Media Professionals’ before the Supreme Court seeking restoration of 4G Internet services.Now, this case brings forth a myriad of concerns over the interpretation and validity of internet access as a right and its underlying importance in the current pandemic situation. The question arises whether internet access can be regarded as a fundamental right, or it is a matter of sole discretion by the government authorities. The case (Foundation for Media Professionals v. Union Territory of Jammu & Kashmir & Anr) particularly deals with the need to restore high-speed 4G services as against the current 2G services in J&K. This presents an interesting issue whether internet access can be capped at a particular speed even if it is regarded as a fundamental right.The petitioner argued that the access to fast mobile Internet is essential in the current COVID-19 crisis for browsing life-saving information about COVID-19, ability to work from home, access to education for students, and continuity of businesses. Restrictions on the Internet speed violate several fundamental rights guaranteed under the Constitution of India, including the right to health, education, freedom of speech, and the right to life.The Government of J&K responded that the right to access the Internet is not a fundamental right and, the state can curtail freedoms of speech and expression over the Internet. The respondent argued that the restoration of 4G mobile services would lead to wide circulation of objectionable material, along with threatening the law and order situation in the union territory. The misuse of data services and applications for mobilizing crowds by anti-national elements can cause large-scale violence, disturb public order, and endanger national security.The Supreme Court passed an order refusing to restore 4G Internet services owing to the significant increase in the militancy in J&K. The court noted that even though access to 4G Internet was desirable in this pandemic, the fact that outside forces were trying to destabilize the nation’s integrity could not be ignored. The Supreme Court recognized the hardships being faced by the citizens, but it held that the compelling circumstances of cross-border terrorism could not be ignored. The court constituted a Special Government Committee (‘Committee’) to examine the prevailing circumstances and the claims made by both parties.The Supreme Court has held that the right to freedom of speech and expression, through the medium of the Internet, enjoys constitutional protection. Hence, any unreasonable restrictions on accessing the Internet constitutes an abrogation of the fundamental right to free speech. The Internet has provided a platform and various opportunities to its users to express their views and opinions through blogs, articles, speeches, videos and many other means. The growing significance of the Internet and its fundamental relationship to free speech compel one to believe that the realization of freedom of speech without providing access to the Internet is not viable.The Government’s contention that right to access the Internet is not a fundamental right at all does not stand valid since Internet as a medium enables an individual to exercise their right of free speech and express their opinion regarding any issue. This is also visible in the Supreme Court’s decision striking down the controversial Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Therefore, it can be considered that the right to access the Internet constitutes a fundamental right.The Government’s stance on the national security issue is valid, and hence restrictions can be imposed on accessing the Internet. Nevertheless, these restrictions must be proportionate to the aim sought to be achieved through the restrictions, and the restrictions must be subject to Article 19(2). Since the right to access the Internet emanates from the fundamental right to free speech and expression, therefore the restrictions applicable to the free speech can be applied to internet access as well. This alternative is much more plausible than a complete disregard to the Supreme Court’s ruling on the fundamental right to access the Internet.If internet access is deemed to be a fundamental right, the question arises whether the access to the Internet can be restricted at a particular speed. For this question to be answered, it becomes pertinent to determine the circumstances and conditions under which internet speed can be restricted. Under normal circumstances, internet speed cannot be restricted by the Government as there will not be any reasonable justification for the same.In the present case, it is important to consider the prevailing conditions in the union territory and the subsequent restrictions imposed to curb terrorism. On the other hand, the extraordinary circumstances of COVID-19 provide for the need to access the Internet at high speed to ensure quick delivery of services, facilitate work or study from home, placing online orders, among other essential IT-based services. It appears that both the sides have balanced concerns, and the Supreme Court’s ruling appears to be justified.The Committee instituted by the Supreme Court comprises of the Union Home Secretary, Secretary of the Ministry of Communications and IT, and the Chief Secretary of the union territory of Jammu & Kashmir. While this might seem innocuous, there are some glaring constitutional issues regarding the Committee.First, it is the role of the judiciary to decide whether State actions violate fundamental rights. In this case, the Supreme Court abdicated its responsibility. Instead of deciding whether the restrictions were constitutionally valid, the court referred the matter to the executive.Second, the Committee members that will examine this issue were essentially involved in imposing the restrictions.Right to access the Internet as a fundamental right in the emerging digital world is a great step taken by the Indian judiciary. In other jurisdictions such as France and Spain, this right has gained substantial prominence and has been given due recognition. This right is constitutionally valid since it is detrimental to the enjoyment and realization of other fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons, including the right to privacy, the freedom of expression and the freedom to access information as well as the freedom of education.This article has been written by Sukhvir Singh.

    "headline": "Removal of Nude Photos from Google Search Results",
    "data": "In the last couple of months, we have helped over 100 victims in filing their content takedown requests on multiple websites and platforms. So often, the content gets indexed in Google Search Results. This content is sexually explicit and usually published without the consent of the individual who is clearly identifiable in images/videos. So, we have prepared this step-by-step guide to demonstrate how an individual can file a request for content removal from Google Search Results. You can read more about removal of revenge pornography videos here.The content that has to be removed must belong to you, i.e., the person making the request for removal. One cannot request the removal of someone else’s content through the procedure described below. The only exception is when a person authorised to do so on your behalf has requested the removal. Such persons include an attorney, a consultant, or a family member.Before we start with the step-by-step procedure, I would recommend that you should go through a couple of our previous articles discussing sharing nude pictures over WhatsApp and Obscenity and Indian Law.To start with, you should go to this link: https://support.google.com/websearch/troubleshooter/9685456. This link will allow you to file a request for the removal of your personal information (including nude or sexually explicit photos/videos) from Google.Step 1The first question you will see is: “What do you want to do?“There are two options. Select the first option that says: Remove information you see in Google Search.Step 2As soon as you select the first option as discussed in Step 2, a new question will appear. This question asks about the information you want to be removed. Select the first option that says In Google’s search results and on a website.Step 3The next question is: Have you contacted the site’s webmaster? Here, we are assuming that you have contacted the site’s webmaster but there has been no response. In case you have contacted the site’s webmaster and the content has been removed from the said website, but it still appears in Google search results, you should visit this link.Here, we are selecting the third option that says Yes.Step 4The next question on this form is the type of content you want to remove. It shows you four options:Personal info, like ID numbers and private documentsNude or sexually explicit items, or names on porn sitesContent about me on sites with exploitative removal practicesContent that should be removed for legal reasonsSince this article focusses on filing a content takedown request for nude photos/videos, we will be selecting the second option.Step 5Now, you will need to select the specific type of content that you want to be removed. Again, it shows four options which are:A nude or sexually explicit picture or video of myselfI want to report content that is abusive of minorsA fake nude or sexually explicit picture or video of myselfA pornographic site that contains a full name or business nameSelect the first option.Step 6The next question is: Are you (or someone you are authorised to represent) in the images or videos and are you nude or are they otherwise sexually explicit?Select the option that says Yes.Step 7The last question before asking for specific details deals with your consent for the distribution of the images or videos. If you have not consented for the same, select No.Step 8Now, it will ask you to enter details for proceeding further with the content removal request. You will need to enter the following information:The full name of the person appearing in the image(s) or videos(s)Your countryYour name, if you are representing someone else, and relationship with that personContact email addressCheckbox to select if the webpage is liveURL(s) you want removed (i.e., URL belonging to the websites where image/video has been uploaded)URL(s) of the Google search result page that contains the link to the above webpageScreenshots of the web pages to identify the contentSignature & DateStep 9 – Part 1Select the checkbox to declare that the information you are providing is accurate, enter your name in the Signature field, select the date, and click on the Submit button.Step 9 – Part 2Google will take around 5-7 days to take down the content after it verifies that the request is genuine. You should receive an email like the one shown below. If you face any difficulties, feel free to contact us at contact@cyberblogindia.in or reach out to us on our WhatsApp Helpline at +91 9340337396.Email from GoogleYou can read more on this from our friends at Cyber Cops here: How to Delete Personal Information from the Internet 2020"

    "headline": "How to identify fake news? Key takeaways from BPRD’s Guide",
    "data": "Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPRD)’s National Cyber Research & Innovation Centre (NCR&IC) published a guide for law enforcement agencies on spotting and investigating fake news and misinformation. This 40-page guide was published on May 08, 2020, but it was subsequently removed from the public domain on May 10, 2020. The actual reasons as to why this guide was removed from the public domain are not known. Whatever be the case, this guide had some good takeaways that internet users, like you and me, can follow to identify fake news and misinformation on the internet.In one of my previous articles, I had discussed how fake news and misinformation spread over social media platforms. You can read this article here. Furthermore, in a crisis situation like COVID-19, fake news and misinformation have definitely made an impact.This guide recognised Wikipedia’s definition of fake news asA form of news consisting of deliberate disinformation or hoaxes spread via traditional news media (print and broadcast) or online social media. It also states that “fake news is written and published usually to mislead with the intent to damage an agency, entity, or person, and/or gain financially or politically, often using sensationalist, dishonest, or outright fabricated headlines to increase readership.”The guide recognises five types of fake news and disinformation vectors:AudiosVideosImages/PhotosTextual PostsURLs, Emails, Social Media Apps & Other Digital PlatformsFalse Connection: Instances when headlines, visuals, or captions do not support the contents.\nAn example of False Connection – Part 1\nAn example of False Connection – Part 2An example of False Connection – Part 1An example of False Connection – Part 2False Context: Instances when genuine content is shared with false contextual information.Misleading Content: Instances when information linked to an issue/individual is misused.\nAn example of misleading contentAn example of misleading contentImpostor Content: Instances when genuine content/sources are impersonated with false/made-up sources\nAn example of impostor content (Image taken from the guide)An example of impostor content (Image taken from the guide)Fabricated Content: Instances when false news is designed to deceive and harm\nAn example of fabricated contentAn example of fabricated contentSatire/parody: Instances when there is no intention to cause harm, but the content in question has the potential to fool peopleAn example of satire/parodyThe guide indicates the following parameters for the law enforcement agencies to spot fake news and disinformation. We can use these parameters in our day-to-day life to identify whether a piece of information is fake or not.Consider the source: Often, messages received on social media/instant messaging platforms contain links that host fake news. They might have spelling and grammatical issues. Look for the signs to check if the information being displayed is accurate.Check photos and videos carefully: It is easy to edit photos, videos, and audio recordings. Check the trusted sources to verify if the contents of such photo/video/audio recording are being reported somewhere else as well.Read beyond the headlines: Attractive headlines are created as click-baits to attract more clicks. Instead of simply reading the headline, read the whole story.Check the author: If the content is hosted on an online platform, search for the author. Check if you can find any reliable sources connected to the same author.Supporting sources: If a story has hyperlinks, click on those links to check if the information being displayed is supported by the content available on hyperlinks.Check the date of publication: It has been observed that reposting old news/stories in the current context has been a trend. However, old stories might not be relevant to the present context at all.Check your biases: If there is a piece of information in the content in question that confirms your pre-existing beliefs, thoroughly review the facts before sharing.Verify from other sources: If you are not sure about the correct news about a particular issue, check if the trusted websites are talking about it.Understand when a message is forwarded: Every message forwarded on WhatsApp is labelled as “Forwarded.”Fake news and misinformation spread faster than wildfire. Fake news often goes viral and just because a message has been shared many times, it does not mean that it is true. With a continuously increasing internet penetration rate in India, fake news has the potential to gravely impact individuals as well as the society at large. Mob lynching is a prime example of what fake news might result in. If you have read this article, then as a fellow internet user, I urge you to:Think twice before sharing/forwarding any piece of information.Don’t simply believe in the headline and avoid the rest.If you are not sure if a particular piece of information is correct, verify it.And if you see someone who is either sharing or forwarding fake news or misinformation, let them know.You can read more on this from our friends at Cyber Cops here: How to Spot Real and Fake News in India 2020"

    "headline": "In conversation with a fraudster: Getting home delivery of liquor in Mumbai",
    "data": "In the last couple of months since the country-wide lockdown was enforced, we have adapted to many changes. Whether there is a lockdown or not, The Cyber Blog India team has continued to assist cyber crime victims across multiple platforms. And considering that the numbers do tell a story, the number of cases we are receiving per day has tripled. In the last eight weeks or so, we have come across many interesting modus operandi that were not as effective before lockdown as they are right now. In the early days of lockdown, sale of alcohol was prohibited entirely; however, the restrictions have been slowly lifted, and some states have allowed home delivery of liquor. Various High Courts have also been in favour of the same. This post illustrates one such modus operandi wherein the fraudsters lure the victims into paying them under the impression that they will be delivering liquor at their home (put simply, home delivery of liquor).On May 20, 2020, one victim got in touch with us on our WhatsApp helpline at +919340337396 and explained how he was duped by the fraudster. The victim narrated the entire incident about how the fraudster assured him of home delivery of liquor and blocked him immediately after he made the advance payment. After assisting the victim with the procedure to be followed for reporting the incident to the police and sharing the details about the concerned police station, we decided to have a conversation with the fraudster from our helpline number.Before I start with the conversation, this is how our Helpline’s WhatsApp Account looks like. Since this is a business account, all the information is visible, even if the number is not saved as a contact. The fraudster here has to be stupid enough to see cyber crime written all over it and still respond to our messages.Our WhatsApp HelplineSo, we started the conversation with a Hi and asked him where he delivered in Mumbai. He outrightly asked to call him, and if we had called, you would not be reading this article. The conversation continued and he said that he would require the payment in advance. We negotiated a bit on the price per bottle for Old Monk and Red Label.Parts 1, 2, and 3Subsequently, he shared his Google Pay number and assured that he would deliver the order within 30 minutes in Andheri. He repetitively asked for sending the payment confirmation screenshot. Meanwhile, we created an IP Grabber link that redirected to “whisky red label” search result on Google. An IP Grabber link captures the IP address before it redirects a user to the intended page. We were not sure if he would click on the link, but he actually did.So far, we had his mobile number, Google Pay number, and IP address.Parts 4, 5, and 6Then, we texted him that Google Pay was not working and he shared his Paytm wallet number. We again told him that the payment had been unsuccessful. As a result, he shared his Paytm Payments Bank account details. While we were doing this, our designer was creating a fake payment confirmation screenshot. As soon as the payment confirmation screen was ready, we sent it to him.So far, we had his mobile number, Google Pay number, IP address, Paytm wallet number, and Paytm Payment Bank account details.Parts 7, 8, and 9Well, the fake payment screenshot gimmick did not work. We told him that the amount had been deducted from our side, but he responded that he had not received a single rupee. We asked him if we should send the address for delivery.His response was something that every fraudster does when he or she fails – using vulgar and abusive language.Honestly, after dealing with over 4500 cases of financial frauds in the last five and a half years or so, it was not at all surprising. Out of four audio recordings received, the ones received at 7:02 PM contain abusive and vulgar language.Parts 10 and 11As the victim had already reported the incident earlier, we shared the information gathered (mobile number, Google Pay number, IP address, Paytm wallet number, and Paytm Payment Bank account details) with the appropriate law enforcement agency and payment service providers. Prior to this incident, we were contacted by 31 individuals who had become victims of this type of fraud. We hope that the concerned law enforcement agencies take appropriate action and frauds like this can be prevented. It is often said that fraudsters tend to exploit the weaknesses in human nature. The ground rule is: trust no one.Let it be sharing of ATM card details or transferring money under the impression that the fraudster is genuine, the chances of recovery are substantially low. RBI’s guidelines clearly state that if there is negligence at the customer’s end, the concerned bank is not liable. The only recourse available is to file a police complaint.Have you been a victim of a financial fraud or know someone who has been? Please write to us at contact@cyberblogindia.in or on our WhatsApp Helpline at +91 9340337396 and share the relevant details. We will try our best to help you out."

    "headline": "Understanding Anonymisation, Pseudonymisation and De-identification in the context of GDPR and PDPB",
    "data": "Understanding Anonymisation, Pseudonymisation and De-identification in the context of GDPR and PDPBIn recent times, the 2018 General Data Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as GDPR) of the European Union has been a document of interest to Indians. The main reason for the same is that the legislative body of India has drafted a bill called the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 (hereinafter referred to as PDPB). Ever since the Justice K. S. Puttaswamy judgement that declared the right to privacy as a fundamental right under Article 21 came, privacy has been an important question in India. PDPB is the first step towards recognising various rights that individuals have over their data. This bill derives substantial inspirations from the GDPR, and hence, it cannot be left out while discussing PDPB.In this article, I will be discussing how anonymisation, pseudonymisation, and de-identification can be understood in the context of GDPR and PDPB.GDPR came into force in 2018, and it was enacted to fulfil a standardised form of legislation that enables the protection of data across all the member states of the European Union. The European Union has a total of 27 Member states as of the year 2020. Hence, it was a very crucial decision to have one unified law governing issues as important as data protection and privacy. GDPR is a stringent legislation and ensures a deterrent punishment for data breaches. For example, Article 83 prescribes a penalty up to 2% of the company’s global turnover or €10 million or whichever is higher.On similar lines, PDPB aims to bring a paradigm shift in privacy and data protection in India. It is expected that this bill would soon be enacted as an act of Parliament.Data anonymisation has been defined in recital 26 of the EU GDPR. The same has also been defined in Section 3(2) of the PDPB. Data anonymisation refers to the removal of identifiers, either direct or indirect, by some form of an irreversible process which must be a standardised process approved by the authorities. This means that the data still exists, but the link between the data and the data principal is converted or transformed in such a way that the data principal cannot be identified from such data.In simpler words, the collected data cannot be attributed back to the person from whom data has been taken or collected. It must be noted here that GDPR does not impose any restrictions for dealing with anonymised data. The same is the case with PDPB. The reason behind excluding anonymised data from the scope of the legislation is simple:As the anonymised data cannot be attributed to individuals from whom it was collected, there does not exist a question with respect to the individual’s privacy.Data anonymisation, over the years, has become a common practice across industries. For example, Google has mentioned in their privacy policy that they use anonymisation in their data processing activities. The collected data is anonymised for building products that are safe from phishing attacks and malware so that search queries are auto-completed, while at the same time, a user’s identity is protected.Generalising data and adding noise to data are considered two primary methods for anonymising a data set.Pseudonymisation has been defined in Article 4(5) of the GDPR while de-identification is defined in Section 3(16) of PDPB. These provisions define these terms as the processing of data in such a way that it can no longer be attributed back to a particular person without requiring additional information. It is also mentioned that appropriate technological/organisational measures have to be implemented so that data cannot be attributed to an individual. The ambit of measures here can include encrypting personal identifiers so that a limited number of individuals, as identified by the access level policy of an organisation, have access to the decryption keys. However, pseudonymisation does not always include encryption. An organisation can also replace specific personal identifiers with artificial data.However, there is a subtle difference between pseudonymisation and de-identification. When data no longer allows the identification of an individual without some additional information, it is pseudonymisation. Pseudonymisation can be done intentionally. Recital 28 of GDPR mentions that pseudonymisation is a practice that helps in reducing the risks; however, it is not punishable to add additional information to identify the individual. When identity-related information is stripped from personal data, it becomes de-identification. This is done intentionally and as per PDPB, it is punishable to re-identify personal data when it was earlier de-identified.The data shall be stored in such a way that it cannot be attributed to a particular individual.The data shall be stored in such a way using technological/organisational measures so that it cannot be attributed to a particular individual without requiring additional information.Let’s understand these concepts using an example.Consider that there is an airline company called X. X stores customer information such as name, address, mobile number, destination travelled to, etc. Here, information such as travel destinations has to be retained by the airline so that its analysts can derive the most frequently visited cities and show relevant advertisements to the customers.However, the analysts do not need to know the name, address, and mobile number of customers for their analysis. So, X assigns a passenger ID for each passenger and stores passenger ID, and destinations travelled to in a separate data set. This dataset is pseudonymised as the analysts are aware of the destinations travelled. However, they do not have access to the original data set to identify which customer travelled to where. In order to identify which customer travelled to where, one would need access to the original database so that passenger ID can be correlated.Pseudonymised data still comes under the ambit of personal data as defined in Article 4(1) of the GDPR and Section 3(28) of the PDPB. On the other hand, as soon as data is anonymised, it does not fall within the purview of personal data and cannot be governed by either GDPR or PDPB.Section 3(34) of PDPB defines re-identification. Section 92(2) states that if a data principal consents to such re-identification, it is allowed and can be done. Similarly, in Recital 31 of GDPR, it is given that public authorities who are doing their duty as per the member state law are allowed to re-identify (although this term has not been used explicitly) the data to a particular individual if they have requested the requirement of such data in a written format. Further, the processing of such data must be in accordance with the provisions of the GDPR.Lastly, there is a difference between the methods of de-identifying data and anonymising data. De-identification can include the removal and replacement of a few personal data fields so that a particular person cannot be identified from the remaining dataset unless additional information is provided. Anonymisation includes the removal of all personal information from the data set in such a way that a particular person can never be identified.Prima facie, these terms may appear complex to understand; however, they are not extremely difficult to comprehend. I hope that this article clears the distinction between anonymisation and pseudonymisation/de-identification.

    "headline": "Can Artificial Intelligence reform the justice system?",
    "data": "Ever since the onset of COVID-19 and the ensuing lockdown, the Indian judiciary had to adopt technology in the administration of justice. Courts have started using video conferencing facilities provided by the National Informatics Centre (NIC) to conduct proceedings online. However, adopting technology is not the same as embracing it. Imagine a situation in which the judge is equipped with tools that instantly provide him with information on the matter at hand and predict the time frame in which the case will most likely be disposed of.What if these tools could also pre-empt arguments each side is likely to present, recommend Alternative Dispute Resolution mechanisms to the parties involved, or calculate the likelihood of a delay in receiving forensic evidence from the police in a rape case? Such is the broad scope of Artificial Intelligence (AI). AI is the ability of a machine to perform tasks that typically require human intelligence by replicating human cognitive behavioural functions. With a surge in the intertwining of law and technology, this article seeks to explore the potential of AI in reforming the functioning of the judiciary to facilitate more efficient delivery of justice in the upcoming digital age.AI can be used to decrease the time consumed by legal processes and procedures during various stages of trial in the following ways:AI can read case files much faster than human beings can. It can also analyse the contents of pleadings, submissions, and affidavits along with comprehending larger volumes of data with significantly better efficiency than humans. AI can prove to be useful by providing the judge with a brief summary or abstract of the case files, chalking out areas of agreement and issues of contention between the parties to the suit, and analysing the evidence presented. This will save the court’s time and allow it to move through the various stages of a trial at a quicker pace. Microsoft has already created a software that can read documents and answer fact-based questions regarding their contents. Ravn has also developed an AI-powered product called Odin, which summarises, analyses and organises documents.Lawyers spend a lot of time researching precedents and drafting arguments. Lawyers are prone to human errors on account of fatigue, sickness, and possible boredom which may impede the quality of legal research. AI, on the other hand, can work non-stop for hours at a stretch with a significantly smaller margin of error in legal research. One such example is ROSS, a legal research assistant that uses AI to analyse a query, search its entire database consisting of every single case adjudicated in the US federal and state courts. Then it delves into the details of each case, and finally presents a list of case laws most relevant and suitable to the matter at hand. AI can also go one step further by bringing out the focal points of each case law to help judges determine whether or not it should be given merit in the case before them.In a criminal case, the court must decide whether or not to release the accused on bail. Such cases require careful and unbiased examination by the court as the right to freedom of the accused must be balanced with the safety of society. In India, bail is the rule and jail is the exception. However, judges often get swayed by their personal bias or by public sentiments if the accused has committed a heinous crime. Sometimes judges might make hasty decisions without considering every possible angle to the case. Algorithms, devoid of emotions, program AI. AI does not possess a moral compass. Hence it can help judges take a swift call in thee matters pertaining to bail, probation or parole, while ensuring that the judges’ bias does not colour the outcome of the case. The American judiciary has already adopted such a practice. The courts use an algorithm called ‘Public Safety Assessment’ which calculates the risk of the accused absconding from legal proceedings by taking into consideration multiple factors like the nature of the offence, prior convictions of the accused if any, the accused’s age and medical record, and other factors. It is pertinent to note that in this regard, AI merely plays an advisory role. The final decision rests solely with the judges. It is unmistakable that machines cannot replace judges because human emotional intelligence is far superior to AI. Adjudication does require a human touch, but AI can undoubtedly play a role in expediting the decision-making process. Humans must learn to partner with machines.With increased responsibilities on the shoulders of the judiciary, the judges, apart from deciding judicial matters, are also engaged in handling administrative matters which include receiving and sending official communications, directing and controlling ministerial staff of the court, planning and organising different categories of trials and sensitising litigants about their legal rights, among other functions. In these circumstances, an AI machine can be programmed to continuously perform repetitive tasks to enable the judges to focus on core judicial activities.Typically, a trial is unpredictable because of a multitude of variables involved in it. AI can predict the outcome of a trial by analysing each party’s submissions, evidence, witness statements, and other legal data. It can calculate the probability of a party winning or losing the case and provide specific reasons for the same. This will not only help lawyers maximise their clients’ return on investment, but also save precious time of the court by encouraging parties to resolve the matter amicably through out-of-court settlements such as arbitration, mediation, and negotiation.Since documents will be read and analysed by AI tools, litigants will have to include every single argument that may tilt the scales in their favour, in their written submissions. At present, advocates put forth all of their arguments in their oral pleadings, and neglect doing the same in written pleadings. The habits of advocacy will thereby adapt to the use of AI, shifting from an emphasis on oral submissions to an emphasis on written submissions. Oral arguments made before the court will become more concise. This will ultimately lead to fewer adjournments of courtroom hearings.You, as a reader, may ask – “is it feasible to develop AI-backed tools in an economy that has been poisoned by the bite of the COVID-19?” In my personal opinion, no, it is not. Until the economy recovers at least partially, now is not the best time to invest in AI infrastructure. However, that does not mean it should never be done. Justice G.S. Patel recently opined that even though technological and financial challenges can be unnerving, they are certainly not unconquerable. CJI S.A. Bobde also recommended incorporating AI in the justice system in November last year. Introducing AI in the justice system should be placed high up on the list of priorities once the economy bounces back to its pre-slowdown trajectory, which according to the RBI, is expected to happen in the financial year 2021-22.The COVID-19 crisis has exposed flaws in India’s legal system. The present state of affairs cannot be allowed to persist. In the 50+ days of the lockdown, courts all over India have managed to dispose of around 35000 cases while working at restricted capacity. Perhaps with AI, the number of cases disposed of could have been quadrupled with half the human effort ordinarily required. Therefore, it has now become imperative to encompass AI technology in the legal fraternity.This article has been written by Ritika Acharya. She is a B.A. LL.B.

    "headline": "Hey Presidents and Prime Ministers: kill the Virus, not Internet and Privacy",
    "data": "In a splintering world with trade wars and protectionist nationalism, the coronavirus just hit the pause button and opened us a new tab with a survival crisis. When this is over, the world might address issues in healthcare governance better or care more about the gig economy workers. But amidst all this, one thing faces tremendous risk, now and in the future: freedom and sovereignty of the Internet.Before the pandemic hit, borders of the otherwise borderless internet were rising high. They were being built by nationalistic content regulation policies and different or no type of data privacy laws in different countries. This global commons that was designed to be cross-border was being split, and its sovereignty claimed. I couldn’t believe this myself before writing my law school thesis on this subject. I found a strong correlation between political events and cyberattacks by countries; with a push from different countries for data localization to further national interests. I had spoken about the Internet firewall of China on many panel discussions but only felt it after speaking to a few friends in graduate school from China. The realities of China’s annexation of Tibet that I had learned from the Internet and growing up in the city of the Tibetan government in exile, were exactly the opposite in China’s version of the Internet.Regardless now, to tackle the pandemic, some governments have built fantastic emergency structures using the internet, be it contact tracing mobile apps or QR code-based patient trackers. But somewhere in the mix, the old ones have been dismantled and the abridgements are not just shocking but particularly dangerous. In South Korea, for instance, mass surveillance of citizens’ credit card details, security cameras, location history etc. was done by authorities, without court orders, setting an unsettling precedent. Israel in its surveillance expansion used data acquired without parliamentary approval to send isolation orders via text messages to people.In the same backdrop is the other facet: information control to further national ideology. Against the already hyper-regulated media in India, the democratic government filed a petition before the Supreme Court to ban any COVID related publication without prior approval from the government. At the same time, law enforcement has been using powers under disaster management laws to prosecute people for online criticism against the government. China’s authoritarian regime also silenced online whistleblowers and expelled journalists painting different versions of the numbers of infections and deaths.Now, this crisis may be considered by some as a window to look beyond, into how governance can be done better and for some, an interesting new toy. One that in Poland, is using facial recognition and location data of citizens to verify that they’re staying home by getting them to upload a picture from time to time. Along these lines, almost everyone is playing it by their own rulebook enforcing national interests, further fracturing the internet’s global image.The differential treatment to the Internet and rights by different countries not only defeats the very purpose of the internet but also pushes countries into balkanized internet islands, supporting the narrative of de-globalization.The problem with all of this is the fact that as citizens, we are fine with this surveillance and hyper-regulation, and at times, even laud it because we are in that new tab of survival. Either through undocumented autocratic power or through the black letter of emergency legislation, countries are entering a phase of surveillance and regulation of the online space that will be hard to come back from.The crisis has the potential to and in fact, is normalizing things that were at some point not even a near possible scenario. Nothing goes to say that this can’t be changed.Singapore, for example, has used transparency and accountability of the government and the people as a tool to enforce strict measures, despite being criticized for being authoritarian. As citizens, we should not outright accept privacy breaching applications for COVID tracing like the one launched in India but instead, call for more open and transparent ones like those in Singapore and the United States. Aside from being transparent, governments need to lay down clear objectives of all surveillance and information control measures and the purposes for which citizens’ data may be used. A potential practical solution to this could be sunset clauses for all such emergency measures that lay down when and how would the measures be rolled back and more importantly, all the sensitive data destroyed. At this point, we might not be sure of when this tab is going to close but we can to some extent influence what happens when it does and the world hits resume. "

    "headline": "Aarogya Setu Application and Privacy Concerns",
    "data": "A contact-tracing application, Aarogya Setu (meaning ‘health bridge’), was launched by the Central Government on April 2, 2020, for effectively tracking COVID-19 infected persons and alarming the application users about the same. However, the app has attracted much scepticism from cyber experts who worry that this might turn into an instrument for mass governmental surveillance, infringing users’ privacy.The app, developed by the National Informatics Centre (NIC), under the aegis of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY), uses a smartphone’s Bluetooth and GPS to detect any encounters with an individual tested positive for COVID-19. Both these features are required to be kept active throughout the day. Bluetooth detects if one has been in the vicinity of an infected person (has to be a registered user of the app). At the same time, the location determines the infected area in which the user is present. In addition to this, the app requires the following personal details of the users to be filled: (i) name, (ii) phone number, (iii) age, (iv) sex, (v) profession, and (vi) countries visited in the last 30 days.The Hon’ble Supreme Court, in the case of Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India, while recognising the right to privacy as a fundamental right, ascertained that any curtailment of the same has to satisfy four requirements:Legality,Necessity,Proportionality, andSafeguards.Though the app seems to be necessary and proportional, it heavily lacks any legality and safeguards. India, as of today, does not possess any distinct personal data protection law as the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019 is still under analysis by the joint parliamentary committee. In the absence of any legal framework governing the app, there are high risks of data breaches, lack of accountability and enforcement, no regulation of the data collected and its use and unavailability of requisite remedies. The app does not mention any existing law under which it is administered.The continuous location surveillance (every fifteen minutes) of the app is a major point of concern as recording individual’s whereabouts, regularly, has grave repercussions for data protection and human rights principles. It is cardinal to understand that if there is any need for recording location data, at all, for detecting the spread of the virus. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that the primary mode of spreading of the coronavirus is from person to person who are in close contact with each other (within about six feet). Thus, large public gatherings, as well as indoor environment, can be highly risky. GPS tracking merely gives an estimate of the location of the user and not the six feet proximity information, which is essential to measure the levels of exposure to the virus.Further, location data is not very reliable for indoor regions. The Internet Freedom Foundation (IFF) has also pointed out in its report that the Bluetooth based technology was ample for tracking purposes, as has been suggested by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and adopted by Singapore in its TraceTogether app. Pairing it with location data considerably deviates it from “privacy-focused global standards”. The app fails to provide any explanation regarding the necessity of the use of both these features together for tracking, without it compromising the users’ privacy.The privacy policy of the app states that the personal information of the user and the location record, in case of an infected user, are stored securely on a server operated by the Government of India. It makes no mention of the department, which is in control, or the concerned authorities accessing the data on the server. It also states that the data uploaded on the server is in an “anonymised and aggregated” form. However, what the Government views as “anonymised” is still unclear. The mechanism and kind of safeguards adopted for the protection of a large amount of “aggregated” data are also not disclosed by the developers or the Government, further strengthening the obscurity.In a recent interview, Mr Lalitesh Katragadda, one of the developers of the app, stated that the data is controlled by NIC, although the servers are not yet managed by it. Currently, all data on the server is hosted by the Amazon Web Services. Will the hostage be ported? If yes, how and when will it be done? Once ported, who will be in charge of it? What kind of data is stored there? How exactly is the data “secured” on the server? Which authorities will be granted access to it? These questions remain unanswered.The personal information collected is claimed to be erased in thirty days once the account is deactivated or the user is not shown to be at risk. However, it can be retained “for such period thereafter as required under any law for the time being in force”. This brings in a lot of ambiguity regarding the period of such retention and suggests its possible use even post-pandemic, thereby, going out of the scope of the app. Moreover, the erasure of data in no way applies to the anonymised, aggregated data uploaded on the server, making it a permanent resource of the Government. The application makes no provision for the users to explicitly request the deletion of their data except by completely removing the app from the phone. Further, no means are provided for the users to inspect the status of their particulars being deleted or stored.Although there is no formal notification regarding the composition of the committee for this app, reports suggest that Principal Scientific Advisor Vijay Raghavan is leading the committee. Its members comprise of IT and Telecom officials along with renowned tech leaders. For an app solely developed to tackle a global health hazard, the absence of any healthcare official in the concerned committee is unnerving. Recently, it was also stated that the Ministry of Health is merely a stakeholder in the app while the entire responsibility of its functioning is carried out by the NIC.The Terms of Service of the app make it crystal clear that the Government would not be liable for any errors or inaccuracies in findings of the app. It also absolves the Government of any liability even in the case of unauthorised access to the users’ information or modification thereof. This brings us to the principal question of who is the user supposed to hold accountable in case of any violation of rights due to the usage of app with no remedy at its disposal. The app’s source code has not been made openly available despite the Government following a well-formulated policy on adoption of open-source software. Furthermore, the terms also forbid any form of reverse engineering of the app. These aspects pose big question marks on the transparency of the application while also restricting community auditing.Another hurdle that this app faces is the exclusion of non-smartphone users which constitute two-thirds of the country’s population. In a country with an enormous population of 137 crores, a mere 7.5 crores registrations on the app will not make much of a difference. Moreover, the developers themselves have stated that for a powerful impact, at least 50% of the population needs to download the app. The Government on April 29, 2020, made it compulsory for all the central government employees as well as those of the public sector units to download the app. In addition to this, it has been made mandatory for all smartphones to pre-install the app and to ensure that buyer can set up and use the device only after registering on the app, post lockdown. This expands the scope of operation of the app from contact tracing to possible geo-fencing later on.Large numbers of users are already registered on the Aarogya Setu application, and the numbers are only bound to rise in the future with the compulsions made. In such a scenario, it is the need of the hour to lay down appropriate safeguards for personal data protection and provide adequate remedies in case of any breaches. The Government, as well as developers, need to be more open about the entire process, the algorithms used, the platforms made etc. and properly educate the masses of the same. Users should be completely assured that their data is secured while also informing them of the mechanism in which it is done and that it would not be integrated with any other repositories of information. They should be given considerable control over their data and proper clarification as to which authority will be accessing their information. The app is, no doubt, a great initiative for trying to prevent community spread and detecting cases more efficiently. However, more cautions need to be taken when the privacy of citizens is at stake. As a result, the app should be made a “privacy-first” contact-tracing technology as is done by the other countries around the globe.This article has been written by Anwesha Singh. She is currently in the penultimate year of her B.A. LL.B.

    "headline": "Coronavirus: Fake News, Phishing Campaigns, Malware Attacks, and much more",
    "data": "COVID-19, or Coronavirus, has brought the world community to a standstill. With any issue that creates panic among the general population, the threat of cyber crimes or cyber attacks becomes imminent. Needless to say, there are hundreds of examples showing how attackers are exploiting the situation and preying on people’s fears. With most of the employees working from home, the boundaries between personal and professional data have blurred. The average amount of time spent on the Internet has increased substantially after the lockdown has been enforced by many countries across the globe.Some of the most prevalent cyber crimes, as identified over the course of last two months, include fake news/misinformation, phishing emails to steal sensitive data or deliver ransomware payloads, vishing calls, etc. Moreover, cyber criminals are even posting fake advertisements for goods or products that are not easily available such as alcohol. As soon as they collect a substantial amount of payments from the buyers aka victims, they delete their Facebook pages and switch off mobile numbers. On top of that, challenges like #sareechallenge and applications like “Which Ramayan character you are?” are only worsening the situation.UK’s National Cyber Security Centre has reported that coronavirus related frauds and scams have increased by 400% in the month of March and has suggested that this is linked to the sudden shift to working remotely. Instances of cybercrime appear to have jumped by as much as 300% since the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the FBI. The bureau’s Internet Crime Complain Center (IC3) recently said that it is receiving between 3,000 and 4,000 complaints every day, up from the average 1,000 complaints per day the centre saw before COVID-19 took hold. Thousands of potential phishing sites have been created which send out fake news about the pandemic situation and attempt to steal data from vulnerable users. CERT-In, and ReBIT, the technology arm of Reserve Bank of India, recently issued warnings about online threats and scams and asked financial institutions to be aware, especially with respect to choosing sources for the information about the COVID -19 virus. They have also warned banks to prepare for a possible increase in the number of cyber attacks.Free Netflix Scam & Phishing LinkFree Groceries Scam & Phishing Link1. Phishing AttacksIn the case of NASSCOM v. Ajay Sood & Others, 119 (2005) DLT 596, the Hon’ble High Court defined phishing as an illegal act wherein a  person pretends to be a legitimate organisation and then extracts user data. Section 66C of the Information Technology Act, 2000 is applicable.For instance, a lot of scammers are sending emails that appear to originate from legitimate screening services such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, etc. and extracting personal information from individuals in lieu of offers and discounts amid COVID-19 lockdown. Previously, various deceptively similar UPI addresses were created for the PM CARES fund to dupe citizens under the impression that their donation will be going to the Prime Minister’s Fund.Most Banks have also sent out warnings with respect to a new kind of phishing scam called EMI moratorium fraud. The fraudsters attempt to contact the victim to help postpone EMI payments during this tough situation of lockdown due to COVID-19. Most people during this time of utmost panic tend to get lured into such offers and end up sharing information like their card numbers, expiry date, and CVV with such fraudsters.2. Malware AttacksMalware is an umbrella term used for malicious software and it includes ransomware, virus, trojan horse, worm, spyware, adware, etc. Ransomware named “COVID-19 Tracker” has been doing rounds which asks for a ransom of $100 in Bitcoin within 48 hours. Otherwise, the ransomware will erase user data from the infected device and share personal information on social media platforms. Another malware called AZOrult was found to be hidden inside a downloadable Coronavirus tracking application. It is a trojan horse and aims to steal usernames, passwords, and other sensitive information.3. Fake News/MisinformationPut plainly, misinformation means bogus or fake news. Circulation of fake news on social media platforms and instant messaging (IM) platforms was a problem even before the pandemic had hit the world (Click here to read about the Great Indian University of WhatsApp). Misinformation is easy to spread but very difficult to control. For a layman, it is very hard to determine whether news being circulated on social media sites is legitimate or not. Messages like ‘WHO requires funds so please donate in the form of Bitcoins’ is not only fake news, but it is also a scam. It turns out that WHO does not even have a Bitcoin account. Malicious attackers have attached a fake link with this message which looks like an official WHO website, but it transfers the Bitcoin to the attacker’s account. Some instances are shown below that we are sure you might have come across them or similar messages:Fake News Example 1Fake News Example 2Fake News Example 34. Existing Vulnerabilities in Popular ApplicationsDue to the lockdown, Zoom app, which is used for video conferencing has become very popular. The number of daily users of this platform surged from 10 million in December 2019 to 200 million in March 2020.  Such burgeoning popularity has attracted malicious actors in no time. It has been found that Zoom contains several critical privacy and security flaws, and anyone with a Zoom meeting link can Zoombomb attendees and broadcast inappropriate content including pornography.Some of the initiatives are listed here:Cyber awareness updates through Twitter handle @CyberDost MHA’s Advisory for using ZoomNational Cyber Crime Reporting Portal at https://cybercrime.gov.inA plethora of scams and phishing campaigns are being conducted these days in relation to COVID-19 to target the general public at large. As an end-user, it is important to be mindful of any potential attack. We are not only fighting a battle against a pandemic but also against an infodemic. Misinformation spreads faster and more rapidly than the virus. WHO explains that an infodemic is an excessive amount of information about a problem which makes it difficult to identify genuine and correct information. Individuals and organisations alike need to cooperate collectively to defend themselves against threats as they adapt the work from home mode for entire teams. In times like these, one must be extra cautious about the websites he or she visits. Emails from unknown sources should be avoided and malicious links should not be opened just because they are offering something for free.Srushti: In my personal opinion, reasons for all the above-mentioned increments in cyber crimes are not limited to a sudden shift to a “work from home environment” or “panic or distress” among people during this pandemic. The reason extends to people being suddenly suffocated in their homes all by themselves making them indulge in absolutely anything online. Getting attention for a person to click a malicious link no longer requires flashy advertisements or lucrative offers, it just requires anything with the words COVID-19 or Coronavirus in it. Further, I recommend that precaution is always better than cure. Whether there is a pandemic/infodemic or not, following certain healthy security habits will definitely benefit you in the long run. Till then, stay safe and please do not click that link.This article has been jointly written by Hardeep Singh and Prajakta Pradhan. They are currently in the first year of their B.A. LL.B.

    "headline": "Defamation Notices Served to Netflix India for ‘Hasmukh’ [Interview]",
    "data": "Netflix premiered a dark comedy Indian TV series titled Hasmukh on April 17, 2020. This series follows the story of a small-town standup comedian from Uttar Pradesh who also happens to be a serial killer. It has been co-written by Nikkhil Advani and Vir Das, and it stars Vir Das himself, along with Ranvir Shorey and Ravi Kishan among others. The story revolves around Hasmukh, the main character, who cannot perform his standup set on the stage if he does not kill somebody right before the show.(After this post was published, there have been two orders passed by the Delhi High Court and the Court of Additional District & Sessions Judge, South-East Delhi on April 27, 2020 and April 28, 2020 respectively. The updates have been added below.)Interestingly, Season 1, Episode 4, while Hasmukh is delivering his standup set, he makes the following statements:Esa pehla shehar dekha hai humne jaha chor bhi bade ameer hote hai. Lekin yaha unka naam chor nahi, vakeel hota hai. Aapke vakeel sabse bade kameene aur chor hote hai. Ye kanoon ke thekedar jo kabhi nahi honge giraftar kyuki ye kalam ke sath karte hai aapka balaatkaar. Are bhaiya, log kehte hai ki kanoon andha hota hai, main kehta hu Mumbai me kanoon ganda hota hai, kyuki har vakeel ke hath me chhota sa itna danda hota hai. Is shehar me har chiz ke liye contract hota hai. Aapka parivar wala bhi bolde hum aapse pyar karte hai, aap bolenge pehle stamp pe likh kar do aur haan, har page pe sign lagega.English Translation:This is the first city I have seen where even thieves are rich. But out here, they are called lawyers. Your lawyers are the biggest thieves. These so-called upholders of law will never be brought to justice because they rape you with their pen. People say law is blind, but I say the law in Mumbai is pretty dirty because every lawyer carries a little stick in this hand. There is a contract for everything in this city. Even if your family tells you that they love you, you will ask them to give it to you in writing on a legal document and don’t forget to sign every page.Needless to say, these statements have not been well digested by the legal community and multiple defamation notices have been served to Netflix Entertainment Services India LLP (referred to as Netflix India), Emmay Entertainment & Motion Pictures LLP, and Vir Saran Das. As per a news article published by Hindustan Times, a plea has also been filed before the Delhi High Court to restrain Netflix India from airing Hasmukh for allegedly maligning image and reputation of lawyers. (An update on this plea is added below.)Out of many notices that have been served, one such notice for defamation and slander has been served by FHS Law Firm, a UAE-based law firm with a dominant position in the country. As per the details available on their website, they provide multi-lingual services in eight languages for their Emirati and expert clients in the UAE as well as overseas. A copy of their notice can be accessed here. We requested them for an interview regarding this notice which was duly accepted. Our questions were answered by Mr Vidur Dhawan, Partner – Corporate and Mr Salah Salem, Partner – Litigation.1. Can you please explain in the reason for sending this legal notice to Netflix India?This notice has been addressed to the Company in accordance with the defamatory comments made towards lawyers and the legal fraternity through its show “Hasmukh.”2. Every show has a plot of their own. In this show, Hasmukh’s lawyer desperately needed money for his own personal reasons. Time and again he asked Hasmukh and his manager for the mentioned money. The standup set in Episode 4 which mentions the words that your firm found defamatory were made in reference to this particular context of the show’s plot. Don’t you think the scriptwriter, producer and other members of the show should be cut some slack with regards to their fundamental right of freedom of speech to go forward with their show’s plot?Freedom of speech giving freedom to abuse the source of bread and butter of millions is not a freedom but a curse if not acted upon. Yes, every drama has a plot, and we all have been viewers of various such shows in our regular lives. Does the wide reach of such platforms give them the freedom to abuse and humiliate the professionals of India on global platforms? Indian professionals like us are working throughout the world and play crucial roles in not only framing the relevant laws in India but also throughout the globe. Do you think it is fair to stand on an Indian platform and abuse us globally?  The show is viewed in multiple languages around the globe, do you think this marks a reputation for Indian qualified lawyers spread across the globe?3. Often, notices are served with an agenda. Can you explain what your firm is expecting from “Netflix India” after serving this notice? Can you explain the direct damage that this show has caused to your law firm? This is not about us alone, this is about each and every individual who has chosen this profound profession for himself for his society and for the honour that it holds. If in the same plot, they planned to portray a doctor held liable for negligence, I am sure they would have not gone ahead with abusing and humiliating the entire Indian medical fraternity on a global platform in this manner under the pretext of freedom of speech and to complete the plot of their show.4. As we are aware in the case of Ajay Goswami v. Union of India, the Supreme Court in 2006 brought forth the responsible reader’s test. This test was to make sure that the reader’s or viewers, as the case may be, must be cautious of the content they indulge online, in this era of technology. Keeping that in mind, don’t you think that legally this may not be a case of defamation as no remark has been made directly about your firm as the audience, as per responsible reader’s test, are responsible for what they interpret from this show. Don’t you think that the interpretation must be left for viewers? Mixing venom in the minds of your audience and then expecting them to interpret your content in their own way has never be pardoned by any court around the world leave alone India. Defamation does not need you to point direct fingers and take names, they have stepped into the lines of defamation with both feet and the respective actions will be taken not only in India but also overseas with the relevant applicable laws in case Netflix does not apologise to the legal fraternity on a global platform but also edits the content in the provided notice period span.5. Do you think the remarks made in the said show fall under any sort of qualified or absolute privilege? If yes, are they enough to shield the platform from liability? The content clearly portrayed their intent to gather humour through defaming and abusing legal professionals. There has been a criminal act with complete intent. We are sure the platform would now need a dedicated lawyer to support them out of this.6. The setting where the defamatory words were said in the show was part of Hasmukh’s standup set. Don’t you think such a setting is not one that is to be taken so seriously? Indian professionals are working throughout the world and play crucial roles in not only framing the relevant laws in India but also throughout the globe. Do you think it is fair to stand on an Indian platform and abuse them globally?  The show is viewed in multiple languages around the globe, is there something more serious to await and call it comedy?.7. These days, people enjoy watching standup comedy which has a hint of reality to make it more relatable for the audience. As per our research, many people on social media platforms subscribe to comedians who talk about politics, about college, about social anxiety as these are some emerging issues that are very relatable. Don’t you think that somewhere people may be facing pressure from lawyers to pay fees? You can vouch for your firm’s lawyers but don’t you think it might be a possibility for other lawyers? Naming lawyers thieves, goons, brokers, and rapists on an internationally viewed platform could not be done to give the audience a hint of reality. Making jokes on lawyers being tricky is completely different from abusing point-blank. The content portrayed will have an extremely negative impact on the young budding lawyers and law students choosing it to be their profession.8. Concerning the last question, don’t you think talking about lawyers asking for money can fall within the ambit of a “relatable topic” which in turn makes it funny or sarcastic? People approach lawyers when in need of them and are quoted a professional fee for it. It would be acceptable if the joke as mentioned above was with regards to certain lawyers being tricky. However, thieves, goons, brokers, and rapists do not sound like relatable topics.9. We appreciate the fact that you are standing up for lawyers in this time where the world has come to a standstill, and lawyers are still working towards the smooth functioning of the State. In this purview, do you think such statements affect the careers of lawyers? Leave alone the sentiments of Indian qualified lawyers; the content portrayed will have an extremely negative impact on the young budding lawyers and law students choosing it to be their profession.10. It is nowhere mentioned that Hasmukh is a Netflix Original series. It is mentioned that the creators of the show are Mr Nikhil Advani, Mr Vir Das and Team Applause. If Netflix India does decide to apologise and make up for any losses your firm has suffered, would you ask for another apology from the producers, scriptwriters, editors and other members from the show as well? Why did you decide to serve the notice to Netflix India and not to the creators and other members involved in the show? The intent of the notice was to get the message across to the entire team and their associate concerns which has been done and we have received a reply for the same by their concerned lawyers. They may choose their shoulder to hold the responsibility for it, what we need here is an apology on a global platform as well as the immediate edit to the frivolous content. We are well prepared with litigating against the concerned responsible parties in India and overseas in case of otherwise.11. Netflix India is currently one of the major platforms where users can watch uncensored content. Don’t you think if Netflix India agrees to remove such defamatory content for Hasmukh, it will open floodgates for litigation and Netflix India may have to start reviewing all such requests for removal of content, even if a piece of content is remotely defamatory to an individual or a group of individuals? To deal with this problem, they need to responsibly review and evaluate their content before putting it up for viewers numbered in millions. Showcasing uncensored content is completely different from abusing a community on point-blank.12. The point of this show Hasmukh is to prove that people still have the right to speak what’s exactly on their minds and not be judged for the same. In the show “Marvellous Mrs Maisel,” they have portrayed a character called “Lenny Bruce” who keeps going to jail for speaking about current affairs in his standup sets. This is, therefore, not an idea limited to Hasmukh, but many people like to depict through their shows that freedom of speech is still alive, and people are still brave enough to speak about it. Don’t you think your firm sending this legal notice beats the whole point of the show with respect to freedom of speech? The point of this notice is to prove that there are a right way and medium for you to practice your freedom of speech. Abusive content dipped in poetry trigged behind a plot-driven drama and humiliating the professionals of your country on a global platform should not be the right way of practising your freedom to speech in our opinion.13. What’s your view about the regulation of such platforms? Do you think that non-regulation from the concerned Ministry and self-regulation contributes to defamation on a larger scale, in the name of delivering content? Absolutely, this is a perfect example of it.FHS Law Firm is one of such parties who have sent defamation notices to Netflix India. With a plea already pending before the Delhi High Court, it remains to be seen how the honourable court deals with this matter. In one of our articles, we talked about the regulation of online streaming platforms in India. There are already multiple petitions pending before the High Courts across the country for regulation of content available on such platforms. Previously, in 2019, the Ministry of Information & Broadcasting responded in an RTI that they do not regulate or censor content on online streaming platforms. To avert censorship concerns, many online platforms resorted to adopting a self-regulation framework under the aegis of IAMAI. However, I personally believe that Hasmukh is not the only show wherein such remarks have been made for lawyers or the legal community at large. The question that has been left to answer is:Whether online streaming (OTT) platforms can take defence under the responsible reader’s test, or a line must be drawn?Update on April 28, 2020: Delhi HC passed an order in the case of Ashutosh Singh v. Netflix, Inc. & Ors (CS(OS)) 120/2020). This order can be accessed here. As per the proceedings held through video conferencing on April 27, 2020, the High Court has reserved its order on the interim stay on Hasmukh’s airing. Notices have been served to Netflix and the makers of the show. The case is scheduled to be heard on July 07, 2020. Prior to this date, the parties are expected to file their written submissions.Update on April 29, 2020: A Delhi-based lawyer, Abhay Gupta, filed an application before the South-East District Court, Delhi under Order 39, Rule 1 & 2, the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908. The suit was filed for a permanent and mandatory injunction against Netflix Entertainment Services India LLP. The plaintiff claimed that the profession of lawyers is a noble profession and the said web series has defamed lawyers. The plaint states that being a lawyer, he is hurt by the statement and had sent a legal notice to the defendant; however since nothing has happened, this suit has been filed as a result.The court, in its order dated April 28, 2020, observed the present suit is for an injunction, not for defamation. It is noted that there is no remark made in particular against the plaintiff and the remarks are general in nature. The order states thatIn a free and democratic society, there is freedom of speech and expression. If a particular comedy series makes any remarks, it has to be read and seen in the context of artistic expression, comedy or satire and not taken literally to content that lawyers are being abused. Law is a noble profession and so are the lawyers, but the plaintiff can’t contend that he is defamed as he is a lawyer. Any artistic expression has to be seen in the context of the work itself. Accordingly, the application for ex-parte ad-interim injunction has been dismissed and the suit is put up for consideration/maintainability on July 06, 2020.A copy of this order, downloaded from the district court’s website, can be accessed here.With contributions from Srushti Iyer and Sachet Sahni."

    "headline": "Global Removal of Defamatory Content",
    "data": "Social media platforms have taken centre-stage in our daily lives. Memes are being shared rapidly on various social media handles and it is pertinent to note that such images may defame public figures, politicians, friends, families, etc. Given that Section 66A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 had been struck down, it is reasonable to wonder the legal dynamics involved in the removal of defamatory content from social media platforms/blog platforms on a global level. This article explores the possibility of global removal of content in the context of a Delhi HC case on the same issue. (Swami Ramdev v. Facebook & Ors, CS (OS) 27/2019).Section 499 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 defines defamation as words spoken or intended to be read to cause harm to a person and believes or has a reason to believe that it will cause harm to the reputation of such person. Punishment for such an act described in this section is given in Section 500. The prescribed punishment is imprisonment up to two years, or fine, or both. For defamatory social media posts and blog articles, there is a degree that must be crossed to make the content so published or said to be put within the ambit of being defamatory or so as to put, it must cross the test of ordinary prudence which is indeed subjective. Defamation, in cases related to public authorities, is often countered by the fundamental right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19 of the Indian Constitution.Section 499 and 500 deal with defamation in general. Before the honourable Supreme Court delivered its judgement in the landmark case of Shreya Singhal v. Union of India, we had Section 66A in the Information Technology Act, 2000. Section 66A read as66A. Punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service, etc. -Any person who sends, by means of a computer resource or a communication device,-shall be punishable with imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years and with fine. Explanation. -For the purpose of this section, terms “electronic mail” and “electronic mail message” means a message or information created or transmitted or received on a computer, computer system, computer resource or communication device including attachments in text, image, audio, video and any other electronic record, which may be transmitted with the message. Here, it is clear that Section 509 IPC is a general law for defamation while Section 66A was a special law for defamation on online platforms. After Section 66A was repealed, there were many news reports where the police were lodging FIRs under Section 67 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 for defamatory content on online platforms. It is pertinent to note here that Section 67 talks about transmission and publication of obscene content on the Internet.Before going into the actual discussion, let’s take an example. Consider that there is a globally known Indian celebrity. Let’s call her X. A user posts defamatory content about X on a particular social media platform. X files a case before the appropriate court for removal of the said content. Now, the question here arises is: whether the court, that derives its power from the Indian Constitution and adjudicates on matters concerning Indian laws, can pass an order for global removal of defamatory content? Here, on the onset, we do not have any international agreement or treaty or regulation that deals with this subject matter. However, it is interesting to see how certain courts across the globe have dealt with this legal dilemma.Starting with the case of Eva Glawisching-Piesczek v. Facebook Ireland (2019) wherein the Third Chamber of the Court of Justice of the European Union ordered global removal of content on the ground that the E-Commerce Directive does not preclude a member state from ordering a hosting provider to remove or block content that has been declared unlawful or content that is identical or equivalent to such unlawful information. In this case, a Facebook user published defamatory content on Facebook about Eva Glawisching-Piesczek, an Austrian politician.Prior to this case, the Supreme Court of Canada in 2017 ordered global removal of defamatory content from Google in the case of Google Inc. v. Equusstek Solutions Inc. The court, in paras 44-45 of its decision, stated that “And while it is always important to pay respectful attention to freedom of expression concerns, particularly when dealing with the core values of another country, I do not see freedom of expression issues being engaged in any way that tips the balance of convenience towards Google in this case.”Similarly, in the case of X. v. Twitter Inc. (2017), Justice Pembroke of the Supreme Court of New South Wales granted an order requiring Twitter to remove content posted by one of its users. According to the facts of this case, the said user disclosed highly sensitive and confidential financial information about the plaintiff. This case has received significant commentary in the Australian legal circles.In the case of Swami Ramdev v. Facebook & Ors, Swami Ramdev approached the Delhi High Court to remove defamatory content against him from various websites including Google, Google Plus, Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, etc. It is claimed that the defamatory sentences were made in relation to remarks, videos, and other types of content related to a book titled: Godman to Tycoon – The Untold Story of Baba Ramdev.On January 24, 2019, the High Court passed an interim order to remove or block the defamatory content to be accessible from India; however, it deferred from addressing the question on global removal of defamatory content. The defendants complied with the order for preventing access from India; however, they argued against the global removal of defamatory content. They argued that the court does not have jurisdiction to order the global takedown of content. They further stated that defamation laws vary from country to country, and just because Indian laws regulate the takedown of the content does not mean that there shall be a global takedown.After hearing all the parties, the court was of the opinion if the platforms were able to selectively prevent access for Indian users, it must be relatively easy for them to do the same on a global level. Further, the court took the stand that merely geo-blocking of content in India does not restrict the Indian users from accessing the said content through VPN. Accordingly, it does not fulfil the purpose of the removal of defamatory content. In the judgement, the court has explained that this matter falls under their jurisdiction as they are passing orders with respect to users residing in India. The court relied on Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and stated that as far as the content has been published from India, the Indian courts are the competent courts for passing an order for a global takedown. In its judgement, the court has stated that“It is not unknown that the Canadian, European and American websites of Google, Facebook, YouTube and Twitter can be accessed in India through various technological means. This would thus result in partial disabling and partial removal.”After going through many cases related to the global takedown of defamatory content, I think it would be safe to conclude that the jurisprudence on this subject matter is in its early phases. So far, the global takedown has only been ordered on the basis of facts and the satisfaction of the legal requirements for a piece of content to be called as defamatory as per the local (or municipal) laws. On the other hand, it can be stated with surety that irrespective of defamation laws and freedom of speech in different countries, the competent court, in its discretion, have ordered the global takedown of defamatory content."

    "headline": "Corporate Data Theft in Cyber Space: Where does India Inc stand?",
    "data": "Modern-day enterprises rely extensively on their IT infrastructure to conduct most of their business operations. In turn, they have a plethora of data that needs to be stored digitally. While some of the stored data may be publicly available, sensitive data like customers’ and employees’ personal information, trade secrets, intellectual property, email communication, algorithms for providing services, etc. must be protected to ensure that financial and reputational risks due to data loss are minimised.In September 2019, a risk mitigation firm Kroll conducted a survey on data thefts across the globe. It found that 41% of its survey participants from India had experienced incidents of data theft in the last year. This number is comparatively higher than in developed countries such as the USA (26%), the UK (32%), and Japan (27%). With the push for initiatives like Digital India, Start-up India, and Make in India, data theft poses an imminent risk for Indian businesses.Unlike Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation and the USA’s sector-specific laws, India is yet to have a dedicated data protection law. The Personal Data Protection Bill has been tabled in the Parliament, but it remains to be seen how the final piece of legislation will look like. As of now, the Information Technology Act, 2000, the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011 (hereinafter referred to as “the SPDI rules”), along with the good-old Indian Penal Code, 1860 provide remedies for an affected organisation and individual.Rule 3 in the SPDI rules specify that the following types of data or information shall be considered as personal and sensitive:PasswordsBank Account detailsCredit/debit card detailsPresent and past health recordsSexual orientationBiometric dataThis rule also specifies that any information that is freely available in the public domain or can be furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005, or any such law must not be considered as personal and sensitive.“Data” and “information” have been defined under Section 2(o) and Section 2(v) of the Information Technology Act, 2000, respectively. Data has been defined as a representation of information, knowledge, facts, concepts, or instructions in a formal manner, and is intended to be processed in a computer system or computer network, or stored internally in the computer’s memory. On the other hand, information includes data, message, text, images, sound, voice, codes, computer programmes, software, and databases, along with microfilm or computer-generated microfiche.As of now, Indian law does not have a specific definition for data theft. However, out of many scenarios specified under Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, clause (b) talks about downloading, copying, or extracting any data, database, or information from a computer system, computer network, or a removable storage device without the permission of the owner or any person who is in charge of the said system, network, or device. Clause (j) in the same provision specifically focusses on stealing, concealing, destroying, or altering the computer source code with an intention to cause damage.Plainly, “data theft” can be defined as an unauthorised act of copying or stealing confidential or personal information from an organisation without the required permissions. As discussed earlier, data theft is possible in the context of client details, source codes, trade secrets, personal information of employees and clients, etc. It has been seen so often that the existing employees of an organisation are involved in data theft. It is also evident from the fact that though employees are an organisation’s biggest asset, they could end up becoming its biggest liability (read pose a high risk to its business continuity, whether intentionally or unintentionally). Hence, it is recommended that organisations must implement a comprehensive set of information security policies supported by the relevant non-disclosure and confidentiality clauses in their employment contracts.If an organisation identifies specific individuals that have been involved in data theft, it has civil as well as criminal remedies available.Against the identified employees, an organisation can file a civil suit under Section 43(b) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Section 46 specifies that the power to adjudicate rests with an IT adjudicator. However, an IT adjudicator can only decide in matters wherein the claim for injury or damage does not exceed ₹5 crores. For claims exceeding ₹5 crores, an affected organisation must file its suit for the same before the competent court. In addition, depending upon the employment contracts, the organisation can also file a suit for breach of contract under the Indian Contract Act, 1872.For the same set of acts specified under Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, Section 66 prescribes imprisonment up to three years or fine up to ₹5 lakh or both. Also, Section 405 and 408 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 are relevant provisions that can be applied in the case of data theft. Section 405 defines criminal breach of trust while Section 408 provides punishment for criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant. Section 408 prescribes for imprisonment up to 7 years along with the liability to pay the fine.Another interesting provision here can be Section 378 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 as it talks about theft of movable property. However, for this provision to be applicable, it first needs to be decided by the courts, whether data or information stored digitally can be considered as a moveable property or not.Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 specifies that when a body corporate fails in implementing and maintaining reasonable security practices and procedures resulting in wrongful loss or wrongful gain to any person, it shall be liable to pay compensation to the affected person. Here, “reasonable security practices and procedures” are considered to be implemented if an organisation has a comprehensively documented and implemented information security program such as ISO 27001:2013, as given in Rule 8 of the SPDI rules. Moreover, an affected person can also seek punishment under Section 72A for disclosure of information in breach of lawful contract. However, for this provision to be applicable, an affected party must be availing a service under a lawful contract.Though the Information Technology Act, 2000 and the SPDI rules miss out on many vital issues surrounding data theft in Indian cyber space, they have served as a primary ground to provide remedies for affected organisations as well as individuals. As it is an inherent obligation of an organisation to ensure the safety of every piece of data stored with it, data privacy is not just a business concern anymore. Failure to protect the stored data does not only have financial repercussions due to legal proceedings and loss of clients, but such incidents also affect an organisation’s reputation in the market.A modified version of this article got published in Jaipur and Ahemadabad editions of the First India newspaper on February 28, 2020.

    "headline": "Data theft by bank employees: Case Study and Remedies",
    "data": "Modern-day banks store a plethora of personal and financial information of their customers. Right from Aadhar number, PAN number, address, mobile number, etc. to income tax returns, spending patterns, average monthly expenditure, property registration papers, and whatnot. In short, we, as customers, entrust the banks with every piece of information we share. However, the same may not always be the case. Just like any other organisation, banks are prone to insider’s threat. In the cyber ecosystem, insider’s threat refers to malicious employees of an organisation that steal, damage, or expose internal data or systems of an organisation that they are part of. At times, a malicious insider can be fully responsible for causing the entire data breach.Recently in December 2019, an incident of stealing customer data by bank employees came to the surface. The Shamrao Vithal Cooperative (SVC) Bank registered an FIR for criminal breach of trust and data leak at the Srinagar police station in Thane against two of its current employee and one former employee. This FIR has been filed under Section 408 (criminal breach of trust by clerk or servant), Section 109 (Punishment of abetment if the act abetted is committed in consequence and where no express provision is made for its punishment), and Section 34 (Common intention) of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, along with Section 43A (Compensation for failure to protect data) and Section 66 (Computer-related offences) of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The bank, having its presence in 10 states via its 198 branches, has filed the case through its managing director, Ajit Venugopalan, on December 12, 2019. The accused have been identified as PS Shinde, RM Satam, and SN Kubal. It is pertinent to note that SN Kubal, the former employee, was also the general secretary of the employees’ union and he was dismissed in November 2017 on the ground of misconduct.As per the bank’s statement, the managing director was notified that SN Kubal had received confidential information of a customer. Following this, a detailed inquiry was initiated by the bank’s IT and Vigilance departments. In its report, the bank’s IT department found that between April 01, 2019, to October 24, 2019, two employees leaked personal confidential data of customers and employees from the Shared Network Access. The IT department identified these suspected employees as RM Satam and PS Shinde. They were posted in Coimbatore and Delhi respectively.It is alleged that these two employees illegally gained access to the accounts of 447 customers, and made PDFs of the documents and mailed them to their personal email addresses. RM Satam then shared the data with Kubal. According to the bank, the employees had violated its information security management system (ISMS) policies and accordingly, RM Satam was suspended on October 25, 2019. PS Shinde claimed that he had accessed the data to inform the RBI and the police about some illegalities in the bank; however, the bank did not agree with this argument, and he was dismissed on November 27, 2019.In the complaint, the bank has stated that this data leak harmed the SVC’s reputation, and it prompted many customers to withdraw their deposits before their maturity. This has resulted in a loss of approximately ₹29 crores to the bank.In cases like these, an affected organisation, like SVC, has two remedies: civil as well as criminal. The affected organisation can file an FIR at the concerned police station under the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, and the Information Technology Act, 2000 specified above.To claim the compensation, a civil suit can be filed against the accused for one or more act(s) enlisted in Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Section 46 specifies that the power to adjudicate rests with an IT adjudicator appointed as per the manner prescribed by the Central Government. Here, an IT adjudicator can only decide in matters wherein the claim for injury or damage does not exceed ₹5 crores. For a claim for injury or damage exceeding ₹5 crores, the aggrieved party must file its application for the same before the competent court.The bank has filed a civil suit against SN Kubal, PS Shinde, RM Satam, and others before the High Court of Judicature at Bombay’s ordinary original civil jurisdiction for compensation and damages worth ₹29 crores through Advocate Prashant Mali. As per the injunction order in IA Number 1/2019 in Suit (L) Number 1335/2019 available on the Bombay High Court’s website, the defendants, their servants, agents, or anyone claiming through them, are restrained from accessing, downloading, extracting, and or transferring in any manner and by any means, the sensitive confidential information from computer systems of the plaintiff bank. Through its order, the court has further restrained the defendants from forwarding, sharing, or transmitting, in any manner and by any means, the sensitive confidential data in custody of the defendants.It must be noted here that in the first paragraph of this order, defendant number 1, 2, and 4 have stated that they will not part, in any manner, with any information that they have in their possession pertaining to the subject matter of the present suit and in relation to the records of the plaintiff bank till further orders of this notice of motion. They have also stated that they will not engage in any activity to access data on the bank’s websites.Advocate Prashant Mali, a leading cyber expert and well-known lawyer, is representing the bank in this case. It is pertinent to note that he also handled the COSMOS bank hacking incident which is touted as the biggest hacking incident against a bank in recent times. In his conversation with the Mumbai Mirror, he said, “The employees have confessed to data theft because they were instigated by the bank ex-employee out of vengeance. The bank also has solid evidence to prove the involvement of these three accused. Crime of data theft with criminal breach of trust attracts a maximum of seven years of punishment, and we will pursue the matter to its logical conclusion to create reasonable deterrence.”It is rare to see such cases get reported to the law enforcement agency while a civil suit for compensation is also filed along with. Section 43 of the Information Technology Act, 2000 prescribes for compensation to be given to the affected person for the acts specified in the same section. For the same set of acts, Section 66 prescribes imprisonment up to three years or fine up to ₹5 lakh or both. When Section 408 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 is read along with Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, one is looking at imprisonment up to 7 years along with fine.The statement made by defendant number 1, 2, and 4 is an implied acceptance that personal and confidential information of the plaintiff bank’s customers and employees is in their custody. Given that this statement is made before the Bombay High Court, the trial court may admit this statement as an admittance of the crime by the defendants.It remains to be seen how this case progresses over the next course of hearings, as it is bound to set a precedent in cases of data theft by employees."

    "headline": "Social Credit System in China",
    "data": "Internet-based platforms have become a crucial mechanism for proper administration and unification of data around the world. At present, there might not be any such resourceful systems in western countries; however, a few design systems about the use of digital media have started to become accessible. The rise of social media in affiliation with advancements in data processing is giving rise to a civilization where various facets of personal demeanour will be calculated quantitatively. In this article, I will be discussing China’s social credit system in detail.The social credit system in China aims to blend a financial credit score system with an extensive analysis of national and social integration for all its inhabitants and enterprises. Nonetheless, this social credit system is not just restricted to one’s economic status but has a broader ambit. It takes into account other vital aspects of a citizen’s life as well, such as their mentality, inter-personal interaction, political views, etc. The concept of social credit system materialized back in 2007, with various projects declared by the Chinese government in 2014.The social credit system in China broadens the idea of different facets of life, such as an individual’s honesty and behavioural patterns. The construction of a social credit system began in 2014. It is clear from the 2014 document that the social credit system was conceptualized in the early 90s. This system might prove to be a beneficial tool for the government to manage China’s increasing population and would allot a ranking to about 1.4 billion people. The exploration period for this system is from 2014-2020. With a few pieces assembled in 2014, the Chinese government aims to join the remaining ones by 2020.A social credit system is a vital component of the socialist market economy system and the social governance system. It is founded on laws, regulations, standards, and charters, it is based on a complete network covering the credit records of members of society and credit infrastructure. It is supported by the lawful application of credit information and a credit services system, and its inherent requirements are establishing the idea of a sincerity culture, and carrying forward sincerity and traditional virtues. It uses encouragement to keep trust and constraints against breaking trust as incentive mechanisms. Its objective is raising the honest mentality and credit levels of the entire society.The Chinese social credit system emanates from grid-style social management, a strategic policy that was implemented in certain selected areas of China from 2001 and 2002 during the tenure of Jiang Zemin. This type of system intended for a close scrutinization of society to obtain data and anticipate social uncertainty in the nick of time. Grid management strengthened the Chinese government’s control over society. However, the government did not establish a strategy for social outreach, and this system was limited.As per the 2014 planning document, there are several criteria which add up to the social credit scores such as government procurement, import, and export trading, labour, and employment. Some other measures include health inspection, taxation, public transportation, social security, scientific research management, hotels and restaurants, Communist Party promotion and appointments, applications for government financial support, currency conversion, insurance sales, the manufacture of specialized equipment, work in mining, chemicals, and the production of food and medicine. The social credit system seeks to set the society in motion and keep a check on their behaviour effectively.As per the Chinese government, the objective behind establishing this social credit system is primarily about creating trust. This system is to break the notion of trust-keeping being insufficiently rewarded. It is clear that the Chinese do have several trust constraints, ranging from pollution, pay disparity, etc. However, this can be exploited for enacting ambiguous regulations such as threatening national unity.This social credit system can be said to be concentrated mostly around the power of the Chinese government. It would not be incorrect to state that this credit system is primarily established and designed for the expansion of the Chinese Communist Party’s power. It is tough to believe about problem-solving being the real objective of the Communist party since social credit seems a tad unnecessary. It appears to be another attempt for an alliance between social, financial development, and political power, coupled with technology.The Chinese government, through this social-credit system, aims to reprimand and reward, i.e., raising the penalties for poor conduct and rewards for a courteous attitude. It seeks to amalgamate innovation with human behavioural control, taking the nation to new heights of autocracy. The evaluation of the citizens will be as per the reliability standards of the state.The judicial system of China does not offer bonafide protection for the citizens. There does not exist any rule of law in the People’s Republic of China. There has been continuous misuse of regulations for political agendas by the Communist Party.On April 25, 2018, the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC), the PRC’s civilian airline regulator, sent dozens of international airlines letters demanding that their websites be changed to show Taiwan as a part of the People’s Republic of China. The message the CAAC sent to United Airlines was made public. In it, the CAAC said,“Our bureau will take further measures according to regulations, including based on Article 8, Section 11 of the ‘Civil Aviation Industry Credit Management Measures (Trial Measures),’ and make a record of your company’s serious dishonesty and take disciplinary actions against your company under Chapter 3 of the Measures.”The system used to pressure the airlines was a pilot of the Civil Aviation Industry Credit Measures, which is part of the official social credit system. In addition to the abuse of power, the side effects of countrywide vigilance, and the possibility of incorrect information, the social credit system has massive potential for adverse consequences.Many firms are associating with the Chinese government to establish a structure of software designs and algorithm models for calculation of credit score. The People’s Bank of China accredited eight companies for starting probation of this social credit system, which include Sesame Credit, Didi Chuxing, Tencent, and Baihe.com, to name a few. Ant Financial’s Zhima Credit is better known as Sesame Credit. It is pertinent to note that Ant Financial is a payment firm spun out of Alibata. The constituent systems use shopping habits, among other data, to inform credit-style scores, on an opt-in basis.Users are encouraged to flaunt their good credit scores to friends and even potential mates. China’s most significant matchmaking service, Baihe, has teamed up with Sesame to promote clients with good credit scores, giving them prominent spots on the company’s website.It is essential to understand the working of the social credit system. It is an amalgamation of algorithms and big data models. The enterprises will be provided with a social credit code and all individuals with a unique identity number. The ultimate aim is to link this to a permanent record. For instance, you could enter the identity code for a particular individual, and the website shall display the credit score or the history of the citizen.The ranking of the social credit score also depends on the geographical factor as well, i.e., the places have their classification, varying from misbehaving, not paying their dues, etc. For instance,The city of Rongcheng assigns each resident a starting score of 1,000 – points are deducted for things like traffic violations, while they can be earned by volunteering or donating to charity. Mainly “good” citizens will be celebrated and their pictures displayed outside the town hall, while “bad” citizens might, for example, find it challenging to apply for a government job.This system has several parts as well, which include blacklist as well. As part of the blacklist, if you are liable to pay the government some amount of money, you could lose some of your rights. However, there is a stark distinction between getting blacklisted and achieving a low credit score.A Chinese journalist named Liu Hu used to write about corruption and the monitoring of censorship. Due to his work, he was arrested, fined, and blacklisted. The journalist found out that he was on a List of Dishonest Persons Subject to Enforcement by the Supreme People’s Court as ‘not qualified’ to buy a plane ticket, and banned from travelling some train lines, purchasing property, or taking out a loan. In his conversation with The Globe and Mail, the journalist told that, “There was no file, no police warrant, no official advance notification. They just cut me off from the things I was once entitled to.”There still looms uncertainty over the consequences of China’s social credit system. Though it is nearing the 2020 deadline, it is not yet fully existent. Several comparisons can be drawn between applications such as eBay, Uber, Ola, etc. that have a rating system whether the sellers/drivers can rate the users and vice versa. However, there is a fundamental difference in their functioning. It would not be incorrect to conclude that the People’s Republic of China resembles the characteristics of an autocratic country, and the Communist Party of China is headed towards breaching fundamental human rights on a massive scale."

    "headline": "Regulating Online Streaming (OTT) Platforms in India",
    "data": "Even with censorship, the Internet is a force for change. ~ Peter SingerOnline curated content services bypass conventional television mediums and offer video and audio streaming media services as an independent product. In 2006, the Ministry of I&B defined IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) in its order as:IPTV (Internet Protocol Television) is a system where a digital television service is delivered using the Internet Protocol over a network infrastructure, which may include delivery by a broadband connection. A simpler definition would be, television content that, instead of being delivered through traditional format and cabling, is received by the viewer through the technologies used for computer network. In case of IPTV, it requires either a computer and software media player or an IPTV set top box to decode the images in real time.”Thus, as per the definition of IPTV services given by MIB, OTT falls under the definition of IPTV, since it delivers TV and other multimedia content using the Internet Protocol over a computer network infrastructure. The innovation in OTT platform-based services has led to an impressive increase in the digital audience. With an encouraging FDI environment, online streaming platforms are widely attracted to cash in on the rapidly booming online consumption of Indian users. The digital streaming services have clearly shifted their focus on content-driven consumers, with emphasis on regional content in small towns. It is an attempt to reach out to a diverse set of consumers by investing in original content. Differentiation of content is a crucial factor to attract the attention of users.With a prompt growth in online content consumption, it is essential to realize the prospects of current and upcoming Digital India. As compared to the previous uniform group of digital users dating back to 2016, today’s users are a much more diversified and bigger with a user base of around 563.31 million internet subscribers, at an estimated growth rate of 13% per year.Presently in India, the Central Board of Film Certification (CBFC), as per the Cinematograph Act, 1952, is a body for certification of films for a particular set of audience. Also known as the Censor Board, it certifies a movie for public viewing based on the content and whether it is in contrary to the national interest, morality and decency. In complete contrast to films and other traditional mediums, there is no regulation of digital content.The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB) is considering regulation for OTT streaming platforms. However, Prakash Javadekar, the Cabinet Minister has said that the Ministry will not take any actions to prevent freedom of media. This has been majorly triggered from right-wing groups over Netflix series “ Leila,” who claimed that it created doubts over Hinduism and maligned its religious scriptures.According to a senior Sangh Parivar member, “It represents ancient Hindu concepts such as Aryavarta and Shuddhikaran as oppressive and dictatorial, suppressing women and restricting their reproductive rights. Nowhere in Hindu scriptures will you find such an occurrence, which is why we raised concerns about the series being defamatory and insulting,”. Earlier this year, the RSS held a series of deliberations on “anti-Hindu” content on the internet and prepared an analysis contending that content available on these digital streaming platforms was shielding Hindu phobic propaganda.There has been an ongoing tussle in the purview of content regulation on such digital streaming platforms. In a PIL filed by Mr Padmanabh Shankar in the Karnataka High Court, a division bench comprising of the Chief Justice AS Oka and Justice M Nawaz held that films, serials, and other multimedia contents being transmitted, broadcasted or exhibited through internet platforms like YouTube, Google India, and online streaming platforms like Hotstar, Amazon Prime, Netflix and Alt Digital, cannot be regulated under the Cinematograph Act, 1952.The petition laid emphasis on the inadequacy of the Indian regulatory framework with regards to serials, films, and other types of vulgar content that primarily affect children. The court observed that these films, serials and multimedia content is based on user requests and these transfer of files and its facilitation through the internet cannot be construed to be brought under the purview of the Cinematograph Act. The court also made the following observation:As far as the guidelines placed on the code for self-regulation of online curated content providers are concerned, we must note that the same does not create any enforceable right in favour of citizens and therefore do not prevent the state from considering what safeguards and regulations within the four corners of law can be provided.In another petition (WP 18801/2019) filed before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh Bench at Indore by Maatr Foundation, an NGO, regarding the regulation of content made available by the OTT platforms, it has been alleged that the available content is uncertified, obscene, vulgar, obscene, unregulated, sexually explicit, and legally restricted. It was emphasized that such content objectifies women and portrays them in a bad light, hence making them susceptible to indecent thoughts and hampering their fundamental right to life. The petition also contended that these OTT players should be brought under the definition of intermediaries and be held liable for offences under Sections 67, 67A, and 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Sections 292, 293, and 294 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. The division bench comprising of Justices SC Sharma and S Shukla issued notices to the Central Government and ten OTT platforms (AltBalaji, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Ullu, Voot, Vuclip, Hoichoi, Yashraj Films, Arre, and Zee5). As of the last hearing, the matter is posted for hearing on February 04, 2020, and it remains to be seen how this writ petition folds out.A PIL for the introduction of regulatory mechanisms (PIL 127/2018) has also been filed at the Nagpur Bench of the Bombay High Court. The petitioner, Ms Divya Gontia, pleaded for setting up of pre-screening committees before the content is put up on digital platforms. The petition highlighted certain obscene scenes being shown on shows such as Gandi Baat (ALT Balaji) and Sacred Games (Netflix). A division bench comprising of Justices BP Dharmadhikari and MG Biradkar had issued notices to four ministries – Ministry of Information & Broadcasting, Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, Ministry of Law and Justice, and Ministry of Home Affairs. Any substantial progress on this PIL is yet to be seen.Justice for Rights Foundation, an NGO filed a petition in the Delhi High Court (WP(C) 11164/2018) to issue guidelines for the regulation of content available on digital platforms, which included shows like Game of Thrones, Sacred Games, etc.. However, the bench comprising of Chief Justice R Menon and Justice VK Rao dismissed the petition after it was brought to the court’s notice by the government that these digital platforms were not under the mandate to obtain a license from the MIB since the matter was outside its domain. A copy of the court’s order is available here.Later, the NGO filed an appeal in the Supreme Court against the decision of the Delhi High Court. The appeal contended that the OTT services provided on these digital platforms are not just portraying unregulated, unlicensed content, but in addition to that, are running ungoverned as well. They also claimed that this has led to the creation of another class of broadcasters with government agencies discriminating against consumers and cable operators. The Supreme Court Bench comprising of the Chief Justice R Gogoi and Justice S Khanna issued has issued notices to the concerned ministries. This special leave petition (SLP (C) 10937/2018) is likely to be taken up for hearing on February 07, 2020.An RTI application filed with registration number MOIAB/R/2019/50364 asked the following questions to the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting:Which government authority/body has the responsibility to regularize or monitor the content on these online streaming services?What due diligence is being conducted while registering these services for streaming content in India?Whether the government plans to bring more accountability and responsibility to these service providers so that they are careful about the content they are offering?The said Ministry, in its response, stated that it does not register or regularize any online portal. And subsequently, this RTI application was transferred to the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology. In its response, MEITY specified thatMinistry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY) does not censor or regulate content.Intermediaries, as defined in IT Act 2000, have to follow due diligence as prescribed in the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011.No information is available with Cyber Law and Cyber Security Group of this Ministry.On 4 April 2018, the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting constituted an interdisciplinary committee to scrutinize the regulatory frameworks for online broadcasting and content on social media. Since then, there has been an induced pressure on OTT platforms to self-censor certain content depicting vulgarity and obscenity. The committee shall comprise of secretaries of the ministries of I&B, Law, Home, and Telecom, and the DIPP, along with representatives of the Press Council of India, News Broadcasters Association, and Indian Broadcasters Federation, to formulate policies for online broadcasting and news portals. The Terms of Reference (ToR) for this committee included:To delineate the sphere of online information dissemination which needs to be brought under regulation, on the lines applicable for print and electronic media.To recommend appropriate policy formulation for online media/news portals and online content platforms including digital broadcasting which encompasses entertainment/infotainment & news/media aggregators, keeping in mind the extant foreign direct investment (FDI) norms, programme & advertising Code for TV channels, norms circulated by PCI code of ethics framed by NBA and norms prescribed by IBF. To analyze the international scenario on such existing regulatory mechanisms with a view to incorporate the best practices.Later in July 2018, this committee was dovetailed with another committee formed by the MEITY as both the committees had similar ToRs.In an attempt to avert censorship concerns, online streaming platforms such as SonyLiv, Hotstar, Voot and Netflix among several others have adhered to a self-regulatory code regarding non-exhibition of any sort of content depicting hatred or disrespect towards religious sentiments and national interests. The self-regulatory code of best practices, under the aegis of IAMAI, also includes signatories such as Zee5 and ALT Balaji. Although this self-regulation can be viewed to curb any governmental action towards these digital streaming services, some notable exclusions from this self-regulation include Amazon Prime Video, TVF Play, and Hungama Play.Part B of the said code specifies the types of prohibited content. It includes:Content which deliberately and maliciously disrespects the national emblem or national flag;Content which represents a child engaged in real or simulated sexual activities or any representation of the sexual parts of a child for primarily sexual purposes;Content which deliberately and maliciously intends to outrage religious sentiments of any class, section or community;Content which deliberately and maliciously promotes or encourages terrorism and other forms of violence against the State (of India) or its institutions; andContent that has been banned for exhibition or distribution by online video service under applicable laws or by any court with competent jurisdiction.The initiative of self-regulation syncs all the major stakeholders towards safeguarding the interests of users in terms of content scrutinization and creative freedom. According to the code, these digital streaming services providers will endorse procedures to establish a crystal-clear classification for disclosure in terms of the nature of the content available. They will also adopt measures to issue viewer discretion advisories to aware the users about the accessibility of their content.This code also anticipates setting up a complaint redressal mechanism to assure the conformity of the code and redressal of user grievances. The establishment of a department solely for addressing the complaints from consumers is to ensure that there is a singular point of association for all such grievances in compliance with the code. In case of violation of the code, the department concerned, after holding appropriate discussions, will have to communicate to the aggrieved person within 30 days along with the precautionary measures taken to address the complaint. MIB and MEITY may forward the complaints received to the concerned department of respective OCC providers. The IAMAI code defines OCC providers as online curated content providers.There are certain aspects the IAMAI code intends to focus, with disclosure being the first pinch bar. However, it is essential to note that this self-regulation code is not censorship. This code for self-regulation for these streaming video platforms is a Faustian bargain since the content is often of sociological concern. There are specific questions of due importance which arise before us notably,“Can we move to a situation of the diversity of content with classification”?It is quintessential to engage with the legal system of the country and create certain norms to avoid a corrupt base. The judicial system is bound to approach the loopholes in the existing laws. Therefore, it becomes more critical to set up an ideal regulatory framework to balance the needs of the industry by focusing on both: carriage, as well as, content. The constitutional conventions are deviating towards a liberal establishment, in lieu of offences related to the content, with Article 19 being principally active, and reasonable restrictions being seen as extraordinary constraints.Digital is going to change the facets and proving to be a game-changer. There have been two factions about the regulatory framework for the content on online streaming platforms. If we talk about a particular opinion against censoring, it is vital to note that every time, there shall exist something to offend at least someone. So if we are treading the path of regulations, we will have to end up regulating almost everything. There is no distinction between media and communication, content and comment, and hence the onus rises more to carve out and regulate everything separately. With regards to the present scenario, India does not seem to be going anywhere to enforce this regulatory framework. It should be crystal clear that it is not a censorship certificate that delineates our choices. Content utilization has drifted from push to pull, and artificially-intelligent code enables us to have an informed approach. There needs to be a differentiation between private and public viewership of content, in a relevant context.It is crucial to realize that we have diversified content available online, and we need to distinguish responsible content for regulation. All these OTT service providers do not fall under the ambit of intermediaries under the IT Act, contrary to the claims of the ministry. However, only the platforms with content class shall fall under the definition of intermediary. The lack of provision to obtain a license has enabled online streaming platforms to take advantage of the legal lacunas. The regulation, prima facie, is dependent on the content accessed by users. For a policy framework to be enacted, there needs to exist an extensive framework and a proper structure for the regulation of digital broadcasting. At the same time, there is a significant problem of prior approval and regulation of the content. It is difficult to determine the same for digital streaming platforms since it is an amalgamation of content which further toughens the industry’s stand against pre-authorization.The present scenario for the Indian courts to determine the extent and applicability of regulatory frameworks is disastrous, and it would be erring to hand over the onus to Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology in its entirety. The vital question posed is whether the broadcasting of content on such digital streaming platforms exceed the reasonable restrictions under Art 19(2)? It becomes crucial to realize that these regulatory mechanisms are not hostile, especially when traditional mediums of television and cinema are covered under the umbrella of certain regulations. It is the onus on the courts and ministeries to step up and decide about the objective to be accomplished through these regulations. It is to be observed whether there is a nexus between the objective of this regulatory framework and uniformity of content regulation in terms of traditional mediums.These regulatory gaps and grey areas are alarming.Even though India has failed previously to bring in a Convergence Law in 2001 through the Communications Convergence Bill, 2001, is it the right time for us to have a converged communication regulation?"

    "headline": "India needs to crackdown ​on the Sex Ad Business Online",
    "data": "35-40% of the content downloaded in India is pornography. As per PornHub, India is also their 3rd largest traffic generating nation. And there are many more statistics to this tune that add validation to the fact that the consumption of pornography in India has gone up multiple folds since the telecommunication sector boom with dirt-cheap prices in the country. So much so that out of the many informative blogs on our website, the one about the legality of consumption of pornography receives a staggeringly higher number of views every day.This post is not about any high grounds on watching pornography. Instead, it is about everything that surrounds a clip or those searches in the darker places on the Internet for explicit content. Most of the people reading this would have come across one or the other type of sexually provocative advertisements- either while trying to download a song (illegally), surfing the web normally even or while watching pornography or other videos. Now, companies like Google in their advertisement programs ensure that they do not pass on sexually provocative and lewd advertisements for the sake of their integrity and reputation, but sadly, many other advertisement providers do not care enough.Often these advertisements contain clickbait for people to sign up for shady services but more often than not, these contain real images of real women and men with their phone numbers that look like a solicitation for sex. Mostly, all of this is non-consensual, results of ex-relationships or an estranged enemy coming into play. Nonetheless, such advertisement business has devastated hundreds of lives that we personally know of and perhaps millions more that never get reported or are buried in some untraceable records.At the very outset, the publication of anything obscene is not allowed and criminally punishable by more than one legislation, including the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and the Information Technology Act, 2000. But as it turns out, most of these services are being operated from outside the territory of India giving law enforcement very little space to conduct investigations and bring culprits to justice. One idea in such a situation is to hold the intermediary (the website displaying the advertisements) liable for prosecution.As per Section 79 of the Information Technology Act, 2000, an intermediary enjoys a safe harbour (freedom from civil and criminal liability) if it satisfies one of the three conditions laid down in the particular section. One such condition is if the intermediary did not initiate the communication, modify it or select the receiver. By that principle alone, an intermediary (let us say a blog) would be protected from the application of law even if its advertisements section shows a revenge pornography clipping with the contact details of a real person. Their defence could be that the advertisement is dynamic and that they have no control over it.In the United States, however, new laws have been brought in at the federal level- the Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA) and the Stop Enabling Sex Trafficking Act (SESTA). Particular provisions of these Acts make intermediaries liable (the only exception to Section 230 of their Communications Decency Act for safe harbour) for advertisements for prostitution and any other non-consensual sex work on their websites. Debates have stemmed from these legislations in no time about how they would actually not protect sex workers which their original objective is.Nonetheless, they do put forward an example of how the future regulation of the internet might look like. There are definitely notorious advertisement service providers who would give a host some extra bucks for permission to promote sexually explicit advertisements and such providers, as well as the hosts, should be brought under the purview of law. All of this, because there is clear culpability of violation of provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000.It is also time that India rethinks its stance on internet regulation in these times. Shreya Singhal vs UOI did go into the details of Section 79 and the IT Rules on the subject, but the questions were more copyright and infringement oriented. A real analysis of intermediary liability needs to be done in order to protect end-users and victims of non-consensual pornography due to these advertisements. To some extent, intermediaries do need to be brought under the purview of the law when heinous offences like non-consensual pornography are committed through their networks (at least through advertisements that are contracted by them)."

    "headline": "The Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011",
    "data": "This article covers the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules, 2011. While the Personal Data Protection Bill is still in the pipeline, this guideline is often resorted to when it comes to issues regarding the protection of sensitive personal data or information. These rules were issued by the concerned Ministry through exercising the powers conferred by Section 87(2)(ob) read with Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000.Personal data is winding up more and more valuable. Therefore, unlawful, negligent, or careless use of personal data can lead to extreme harm to an individual as well as to an organization. The reason for personal data protection isn’t to simply protect an individual’s data but also is to ensure the basic fundamental rights of the citizens. To guarantee that one’s personal data is secured and is not being misused by any individual or organization, the governments across the world often pass laws and regulations for laying down the ground rules for the processing of personal data of their citizens.It defines biometrics under Rule 2(1)(b) as the technologies that measure and analyses physical characteristics of humans, like fingerprints, eye retinas and irises, voice patterns, facial patterns, hand measurements and DNA for authentication purposes.It defines a password under Rule 2(1)(h) as a secret word or phrase or code or passphrase or secret, or encryption or decryption keys that one uses to gain admittance or access to information.Rule 3 specifies that the following types of data or information shall be considered as personal and sensitive:PasswordsBank Account detailsCredit/debit card detailsPresent and past health recordsSexual orientationBiometric dataRule 3 also clarified that any information which is freely available on the public domain or furnished under the Right to Information Act, 2005, or any such law, must not be considered as personal and sensitive for the purpose of these rules.Rule 4 places an obligation on organizations collecting and dealing with any kind of sensitive personal data or information to draft and publish a privacy policy detailingType of information collectedPurpose of collecting such informationDetails about disclosure of collected information to any third partyReasonable security practices and procedures taken by the organization to protect the dataRule 5 talks about the collection of data. It says thatA body corporate or any person must obtain the consent of an information provider before collecting any sensitive personal data or information.A person shall not collect any sensitive personal data or information of an individual unless there is a connected lawful purpose.The information provider must be provided with an alternative to not to give sensitive personal data or information.The data collected shall not be used for any purpose other than specified at the time of its collection.A body corporate must appoint a grievance officer to address the complaints. The contact details of such officer must be available on the website of a body corporate.Rule 6 focusses on the disclosure of information to third parties. It says that disclosure of any sensitive personal data or information to any third party requires prior permission of the information provider, except in the cases where the data is requested by a government agency for the purpose of identity verification, or for preventing, detecting, investigating crimes. Also, a third party receiving sensitive personal data or information must not publish or further disclose that data.Rule 7 talks about the sharing of information. A body corporate is allowed to share or transfer sensitive personal data or information of an individual to a body corporate registered in India or outside that undertakes to ensure the protection of data at the same level as provided for under these Rules. The transfer is allowed when the transfer of data is essential for the performance of a lawful contract, or the transfer is undertaken subsequent to the consent of an information provider.Rule 8 discusses reasonable security practices and procedures. A body corporate is considered to have complied with reasonable security practices and procedures, if they have implemented security practices and standards along with having a comprehensive documented information security program and information security policies such as ISO 27001:2013. Such security policies must be duly approved by the central government. A body corporate must allow an auditor to conduct an audit of its reasonable security practices and procedures, at least once a year.A single body corporate is bound to store personal data of hundreds of thousands of individuals. It is an inherent obligation of the said body corporate to ensure that every piece of data stored with it is safe and protected. Data privacy is not just a business concern anymore. An individual has his entire life at stake when it comes to the violation of his privacy. Hence, a body corporate must be meticulous while collecting the data, while an information provider must be prudent while sharing his data. Though the 2011 rules miss out on many vital issues, they have still acted as basic rules for reasonable security practices and handling of sensitive personal data or information. With the personal data protection bill bound to be passed sooner than later, it seems that the time is going to be up for the 2011 rules."

    "headline": "The Great Indian WhatsApp University",
    "data": "WhatsApp is one of the most popular platforms for communication in India. With a user base of more than 400 million users, it has unfortunately become one of the most misused platforms, as far as misinformation and fake news are concerned. Owing to this, the term “WhatsApp University” has emerged, which is slang for the most ridiculous and unreal news that gets circulated. People now share memes and false information related to election, politics, religion, and whatnot.The rationale behind using the term “WhatsApp University” is that the universities are a medium to provide knowledge and information. Similarly, since WhatsApp has taken over as the most preferred communication medium in India, it is now being used to share information which is rather funny and unrealistic, and it may have serious sequences.On searching the term WhatsApp University on any search engine, one can find memes of many of the political leaders in position at present or maybe even find articles with false news about various propaganda. People share such news as WhatsApp forwards, but they do not understand how to differentiate between factually correct news or fake news, or even how to identify fake news.In 2017, it was noticed that there was about a 50% increase in the messages related to the propagation of elections through WhatsApp. A Mood of the Nation poll was conducted in 2017 by Lok Niti, and it was noticed that about one-sixth of the members on WhatsApp were added to some group by a political party leader to propagate and win votes for the elections.Another survey was conducted in 2018 concerning the reliability of the news that is spread through WhatsApp. The results were that WhatsApp is the least trusted source of news with merely 29% reliable information, whereas the news on televisions is about 50% trustworthy and the printed news, i.e., newspapers, magazines, etc. are the most reliable with a score of 55%.This issue may seem trivial, but it has led to various grave issues like people’s lives being lost owing to fake news being forwarded. No source is 100% genuine today, and even trying to verify whether a piece of news is real or fake is indeed tricky. People generally forward messages on WhatsApp that they think is important in terms of awareness and want their family or friends or relatives to be safe. After another survey in 2018, it was noticed that people in the age group of 25 years and above tend to forward messages without verifying the source. The people within the age group of 18-25 years either merely ask the person they received it from if the news is fake or use search engines, but again, search engines are still not the most reliable sources. This is the sole reason behind fake news traveling so very quickly through WhatsApp.People do not understand that their actions may sooner or later lead to injustice. The internet usage in rural areas has proliferated since the last election in 2014; hence, the parties involved in the 2019 election knew that their biggest platform for propaganda is the internet – with WhatsApp and Facebook being the largest market.The Hindustan Times newspaper reported that BJP appointed about 9,00,000 people with specialized tasks of localized WhatsApp campaigning whereas, the Congress party focused on posting campaigns on Facebook and distributing it via WhatsApp. Both the parties have been known to be posting misleading and unwanted information time and again to propagate their party. In this year itself, Facebook has taken down about 687 pages or accounts related to the Congress on the grounds of coordinated inauthentic behavior. BJP started mapping electoral rolls against purchased phone numbers and names and based on specific demographics like religion, caste, etc.They started targeted messages to win votes that were not necessarily true. The same was stated by Mr. Shivam Shankar Singh, a former BJP data analyst who worked on regional elections in 2017 and 2018. The national spokesman, Mr. Gopal Krishna Agarwal, denied that the party had any official set up on WhatsApp for their election propaganda and also stated that the forum was merely used as means of communication between party workers.Mr. Singh also stated that there were about 2,00,000 pro-BJP WhatsApp groups in northern Uttar Pradesh, the most populous state in India. The problem with the platform of WhatsApp is that unlike Twitter or Facebook, the content on WhatsApp cannot be checked, monitored, or filtered as the platform is private, and the users are protected by end-to-end encryption.WhatsApp has time and again said that this is unlikely to change as they believe that people must be able to communicate online with full privacy. At the same time, it is pertinent to note that almost half a million Indians are being tricked or fooled into exercising their fundamental right to vote based on fake news and fake promises that are forwarded as WhatsApp messages.A voter may be under the impression that he has made an informed decision when he put in his vote, but he is entirely unaware of the reliability of the information being shared on WhatsApp and other social media platforms. Though certain initiatives have been taken by WhatsApp to put a check over WhatsApp forwards, however, they are many loopholes that can be used to bypass the implemented measures. For example, merely copy-pasting a message will take it out of the “number of times” forwarded count.WhatsApp has also shared recently that it bans about 2 million accounts every month globally that send automated spam messages. Further, the updated privacy settings allow a user to decide who can add him to a group. Earlier, a user could be added by anybody to a WhatsApp group. It has been found that due to these measures, WhatsApp has reduced fake news by 25%, but multiple fact-checkers have stated that the problem of fake news is still rampant.There does not seem to be a full-proof solution to the problems created by our homegrown WhatsApp University. One possible solution is to change the privacy policy and monitor each message specifically, but that seems to raise a few eyebrows as it will be a grave violation of the right to privacy of individuals which was declared as the fundamental right under Article 21 of the Constitution in the landmark case of Justice (Retd.) KS Puttaswamy v. Union of India. So, for users like you and me, the bottom line is to keep a check on the messages we share on messaging platforms and making sure we do not end up graduating from the Great Indian WhatsApp University (read as become a victim of fake news and misinformation).On April 10, 2020, our friends at LcmediaHouse published a series of photos with a sarcastic take on the admissions into the WhatsApp University. These photos are apt and in line with this post. They are embedded below.Admissions Open!

    "headline": "Cyber Attack on Indian Nuclear Power Plant – Explained",
    "data": "India is a developing country. It is a well-accepted fact that a developing country requires energy to move towards being a developed country. But in the race to become a superpower, what if the security of one of the most critical and crucial assets of the nation is compromised?On 4th September 2019, a malware attack on the Kadankulam Nuclear Power Plant (KKNPP) was detected by CERT-In (Indian Computer Emergency Response Team). KKNPP is India’s largest nuclear power plant. The power plant has two Russian pressurized water reactors which have a large capacity of 1000 megawatts each. KKNPP has also planned to install four more nuclear reactors units, which would result in the most significant collaboration between Russia and India in the nuclear energy sector.Though the operational systems and the administrative systems of the KKNPP are separate, it was found that one PC, connected to the internet-connected network, was infected. This PC belonged to a user, and it was used for administrative purposes. As per the statement issued by the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL), this network is isolated from the critical internal network.Before the acceptance of this attack by AK Nema, Associate Director at NCPIL, R Ramdoss, Training Superintendent and Information Officer at KKNPP issued a statement that categorically denied any instance of cyber attacks on the nuclear power plant.It has been reported that the information about the cyber attack on the KKNPP network was shared by a certain security researcher called Pukhraj Singh, who is said to have been notified by an undisclosed party. Accordingly, the attack was reported to India’s National Cyber Security Coordinator, Lt. Gen. (Retd.) Rajesh Pant on September 03, 2019, and subsequently, CERT-In confirmed a day later.During the investigation, the indicator of compromise (IoC) was found to be a Dtrack malware, which has been recently affecting enterprise networks and ATMs. It is believed that this malware has been created by a group called Lazarus with links to North Korea.When cyber attacks on nuclear power plants are discussed, the Stuxnet attack causing substantial damage to Iran’s nuclear power program is a prime example of the consequences of a successful cyber attack. Nuclear power plants of a country are a part of its critical infrastructure, and if an attacker with malicious intent is able to break into computer networks, the results can be indeed disastrous.IML (Issue Makers Lab), which is a non-profit intelligence organization in South Korea, has shared evidence of the cyber attack online and has claimed that the attack was initiated from North Korea. They further added that they have been monitoring the Lazarus group since 2008. North Korea has been interested in thorium-based nuclear power in which India is a leader. As of now, North Korea is using uranium-based nuclear power, and there are theories that they want to replace it with thorium-based nuclear power.IML claims that earlier, the North Korean hackers have targeted several top Indian scientists through “malware-laced” emails, such as former Atomic Energy Commission chairman, ex-BARC director, etc. through which the hackers can contact anyone in India’s nuclear energy sector with a trusted relationship. This Korean intelligence group has been revealing about the North Korean hackers through Twitter since October 31.Co-authored by Sammed Akiwate and Raj Pagariya."

    "headline": "Pegasus: the WhatsApp Spyware",
    "data": "Pegasus WhatsApp SpywareWhat is Pegasus?Pegasus is a type of spyware created by the NSO Group, a company based out of Israel. Like any other app, WhatsApp too had a loophole in its application which was exploited by the company by using this spyware. A missed call to the phone was enough to embed the malware into a victim’s device. Pegasus was first reported in May 2019 after which Whatsapp did make a public announcement. However, as the Indian Government claims, no intimation as to accounts of Indian citizens being compromised was given by WhatsApp.Then, why is Pegasus being hyped again? The recent limelight was drawn towards the spyware following WhatsApp’s decision to institute a suit against the NSO Group in the USA. More so as newspaper and new channels claim, a WhatsApp spokesperson said that the company approached citizens whose accounts were compromised a week ago to assist them. WhatsApp has accepted the fact that a few Indian citizens were also part of approximately 1400 individuals targeted. Following this, the Indian Government put questions to WhatsApp for breach of privacy of Indian citizens. Can WhatsApp be made liable for the breach?This is the major question lurking the minds of plenty. Like any other application out there, WhatsApp too is bound to have certain bugs and security teams at the company continually fix them.  Does merely the presence of a bug make WhatsApp responsible? More so, does the presence of a bug give NSO Group the right to exploit it? Simply put,Merely having the backdoor of a house open does not give any passerby the right to enter the house and make a mess. It would still amount to trespass.Likewise, the presence of a loophole does not give NSO Group the right to exploit the vulnerability. As an individual would not be liable for accidentally leaving the back door open, so would WhatsApp not be liable for a bug in the app.Having said that, WhatsApp does have a duty of care towards its users. It needs to be seen what action did WhatsApp take the moment the bug was identified. Whatsapp claims the vulnerability has been patched. Moreover, it went on to contact the targets to assist them. However, what is yet to be seen is the compliance in handling the breach of personal data by WhatsApp in accordance with mandates and requirements of GDPR.Article 33 of the GDPR requires that in case of any breach of personal data, the controller informs the supervisory authority within 72 hours. Any delay in doing so has to be reasonably explained. Since GDPR’S enforcement, hefty fines have been imposed on several tech giants by nations owing to similar breaches. Is WhatsApp next in line? As events unfold, only time will tell.  "

    "data": "India as a country has been known for its culture and religious diversity since time immemorial. In the past few years, great concerns regarding obscene and pornographic videos on the Internet have been raised by various groups in society. The Internet has become a necessity these days and with over 40 crores Internet users in India itself, it has become even more difficult to control the flow of pornographic content on the web and social media platforms.One such social media platform is Tiktok where we, as well as many users in India, have encountered pornographic or obscene content being shared without any restriction. Tiktok is a Chinese video making app which was basically meant for making and sharing short-duration videos. Due to its sudden popularity in the nation, where 65% of the population is youth, this became a mode to earn name, fame and money. This application has also become an alternative for employment for some since the application gave money to people with a large number of followers and the most followed people became social media influencers. Simply search on Google – how to make money on Tiktok – and the search results will be enough to prove the last point. It is pertinent to note that India has 120 million monthly active users on Tiktok. We have also seen a few cases where the parents have bought expensive mobile phones for their children as they wanted to pursue modelling and hence, for them, Tiktok seemed a good way to start.Just like every good thing has a negative side, this has too. Some users of this app started posting vulgar, explicit and pornographic content. Younger children using the application were prone to viewing this kind of content as it is uncensored and unregulated. In the last few months, there have been multiple incidents where Tiktok users harmed themselves while making a video. For example,A 19-year old boy was shot dead by his friends while making a video.A college student died as his scooter was rammed into a bus while filming.A man died as his leg was struct in the cultivator while shooting a video.A man actually slit the throat of his wife when they were making a Tiktok video pretending that the husband is slitting the wife’s throat.One Tiktok user used to record videos dressed as a woman ended up committing suicide as he faced severe backlash from other users.The application has already been banned in Bangladesh (in February 2019) and in Indonesia (in July 2018) for pornographic content and inappropriate content respectively. Moreover, it was fined $5.7 million in the United States for illegally collecting information about children in February 2019.A petition was filed in the Madras High Court by lawyer-cum-social activist S Muthukumar, about the pornographic content, child abuse, cultural degradation and suicides resulting from Tiktok. It was also stated that the app in question left younger children vulnerable to pedophilic strangers. Noting all the damaging effects of the app, the two judge-bench of Justice N Kirubakaran and Justice SS Sundar of Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on April 3, 2019, ordered an ex-parte interim order asking the Central Government to ban the alleged app. The court order stated that the app is mostly used by mostly teenagers and it is found to be addictive. In addition, the court expressed concerns about the application hosting inappropriate content including pornography.Furthering which, the developer company ByteDance Technology (India) Pvt Ltd requested to suspend the ban by filing a Special Leave Petition in the Supreme Court. The honourable court refused to hear the matter on an urgent basis as well as denied to stay the order passed by the Madurai bench of the Madras High Court as the matter is still sub-judice. The Supreme Court on April 15, 2019, directed the Madras HC to hear the case for ad interim relief and posted the case for hearing on April 22, 2019.On April 16, 2019, the Madras HC appointed an independent counsel to assist the court in assessing the impact of the application and pushed the hearing date to April 24, 2019.In order to comply with the April 03 order of the Madras HC, the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MEITY) issued a directive to Apple and Google requesting them to abide by the Madras High Court orders to take down the app to prevent further downloads from Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store.In a company statement, TikTok stated that it was committed to following the local laws and had faith in the Indian Judicial system. He added that TikTok believes in a healthy and pure in-app environment and will focus on such critical topics to end this for once and all. Tiktok is also dedicated to following the Code of Ethics which were laid down by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) and would also help curb the fake political news on their application. The company has claimed to have deleted 6 million videos which violated the terms of use and community guidelines.Tiknot is not available on Google Play Store anymore.Although the application is not available for downloading anymore on Google Play Store and Apple’s App Store, the users who already have the application installed on their phone can continue to use the application without any restriction. On a similar note, the installation of Tiktok has only been blocked from the official sources which will essentially lead to a spike in the downloads via untrusted third-party sources. There is also a possibility that these untrusted sources might include malware in the APK file which will have disastrous effects on an individual’s privacy. Keeping a track of user activities, uploading user data to a server, stealing user data, blackmailing, and harassments are some of the undesired outcomes.In this case, there can be two extreme sides of the argument on the application being banned.First, banning the application from the online stores is a right step as we need to take stringent measures to prevent obscene or sexually explicit content reaching to the internet users who are minor.Second, putting a blanket ban on one application is not going to solve the problem. Necessary steps must be taken to ensure that such type of content is not accessible by the minors.Here, we agree with both these arguments to an extent. Self-regulation is a key aspect for applications like Tiktok and they have acknowledged the fact in their statement that they have removed around 6 million videos from their platform. However, we do not have any regulatory mechanisms which deal with issues like this – neither there is a regulatory body nor there is a law which specifically addresses this issue. The onus not only lies on applications like Tiktok but also the government to implement necessary steps to ensure that the required checks and balances are maintained on platforms like Tiktok. With the next hearings scheduled on April 22 and April 24 in the Madras HC and the Supreme Court respectively, it will be really interesting to see how this case unfolds.Many internet users have found the Madras HC order as a relief and there is a flood of memes being shared across major social media platforms on this incident. Abhay Singh Sengar, our Creative Head & Legal, also shared one post which is a compilation of such memes on this incident."

    "headline": "Koi mere data ka kya karega?",
    "data": "Data breaches, leaks, hacks and all the fancy lingo that surrounds the technology space today is mostly too complex for an average user to comprehend. When faced with this possibility of companies and data aggregators having access to their personal information, users are mostly fine with the trade-off against the services that they receive. This has made the introduction of privacy as a fundamental thing highly challenging in today’s scenario. Although new legislation and movements for privacy are on the rise, the induction of privacy in an ordinary user’s life is very challenging. Privacy is not for things like your location, passwords, sexual preferences etc. only!One imperative reason is the lack of understanding among average internet users about how it all works. People are mostly overwhelmed with attractive applications and how the internet knows what they like and dislike. This puts any effort to make people cautious and aware, on the backfoot. And it is not like privacy did not exist when the internet wasn’t around. Parents would educate children to not disclose their home address, papa and mumma’s office timings etc. to anyone. The manifestations of these offline risks were clear and everyone cared about them. Cut to today, when the same things are not just told to one random person but broadcast via social media platforms to the entire world. The case also is that most of the people today were not born in the age of technology, they had to transition and adapt. The exercise to understand technology and bring in another change seems futile to most users. I don’t have anything to hide!Most of the time, most of the users do not really understand the kind of data that they generate about themselves. For most of the people who are just in awe of the internet and its magic, data is just the images and text messages that they have on their smartphones, add a few other characteristics like location data, WhatsApp messages etc. How about your health insurance premiums get calculated based on your lifestyle assessed as part of your online history of junk food purchases? How about you become part of a targetted disinformation campaign because of a page that you hit like on? How about that highly convincing phone call you received about your debit card’s expiry?Does your child use snapchat? Have you taken a look at the snap map? Now, this is something that I feel does have some kind of impact. Ask them for their savings account balance and a list of their transactions in the last month. Crazy, right? Why would someone share such a thing and why would you even ask? Think of a random game or app that you installed a few days ago- when it asked for permission to access your text messages, you said yes! Just a one time access to your messages can create an entire profile of yours in a structured fashion with the number of bank accounts you have, the last few digits of those account numbers, transaction history, current balance, locations of ATMs that you withdrew cash from, addresses of shops that you purchased goods at and the list goes on. Don’t believe me? Download any budget management app on your phone and see how they work. Would you still say, “koi mere data ka kya karega?” "

    "headline": "German Competition Regulator Prohibits Facebook to Combine User Data From WhatsApp and Instagram",
    "data": "Do you have a social media account?German Competition Regulator Prohibits Facebook to Combine User Data From WhatsApp and InstagramThe answer to this question is very obvious and having an online presence on multiple social media platforms is a norm these days. Today’s tech-savvy world does believe that social media connects people from different corners of the globe. Almost 2.46 billion people around the globe access various social media platforms and the most popular among them is Facebook. This US-based social media giant has 2.32 billion users worldwide and has its subsidiaries such as Whatsapp Inc. and Instagram. While surfing on the internet, a virtual persona of an individual is created depending upon the type of content watched by a person; photos and videos shared and posts liked by him and even product searched on online shopping sites. Or in other words, social media platforms track a user’s behaviour to serve them with the appropriate advertisements. Like button plays a very important role in this. Most of the revenue of the social media sites is collected from advertisements and the advertisements displayed on a user’s profile are targeted ads.Whatsapp, Instagram and Facebook have a similar kind of functionalities to an extent and they are owned by Facebook itself, Facebook used to combine data from Instagram and WhatsApp into one Facebook user account without any restriction – practically. This combination of data from different platforms will now be subject a voluntary consent given by a user, as per the GDPR. According to Andreas Mundt, the chief of Federal Cartel Office, Germany’s competition regulator,The combination of data sources substantially contributed to the fact that Facebook was able to build a unique database for each individual user and thus to gain market power.In their decision, the agency stated that Facebook-owned companies such as WhatsApp and Instagram can continue to collect the user data, however, they cannot assign it to any Facebook user account unless voluntary consent is obtained from the concerned user. If a user does not agree, his user data must remain with respective services and it cannot be processed on the lines of Facebook data. Being a dominant company, Facebook is subject to special obligations under the French competition law. While making the announcement, the FCO chief also said thatServices that are provided by these social media platforms are free of cost, but revenue collected is through advertisements and value of the amount of revenue through advertisements increase with the details of user data which could lead to exploitative use of user data.To stop the unrestricted collection of data, the Competition chiefs in Germany ordered Facebook on February 07th, 2019 to stop combining data with any other platforms including websites having like buttons unless and until the user gives consent to do so. Responding to this ruling, Facebook stated that they have already revamped the information they provide and control over data to a customer in order to comply with the provisions of the GDPR. They face fierce direct competition from apps like Twitter, YouTube, Snapchat, etc. and using information across services helps to improve the services and enhance a user’s safety.The German agency’s verdict is not final yet as Facebook has one month to appeal to the Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court. If the Dusseldorf Higher Regional Court upholds this ruling, it will set a new precedent dealing with sharing of user data between advertisement platforms."

    "headline": "Regulating Video Streaming Platforms – Delhi HC says NO!",
    "data": "In recent times, people in India have started exploring new sources of entertainment. In proportionality to the deduction of the internet charges in India, more and more people of the country have received access to the web at a cheaper affordable price. The launch of Jio eventually led to internet prices of all service providers taking a significant downfall.Regulating Video Streaming Platforms – Delhi HC says NO! (Background Image: katemangostar at freepik.com)Earlier, the most viewed sources of information and entertainment were television channels and movie theatres, which were censored by the Censor Board of Film Certification (CBFC) under Ministry of Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. Tables have turned and with an increasing penetration rate of internet users in India, online media streaming platforms are easily accessible via mobile phones. Since 2015, these platforms have seen a boom in the viewership once they were launched in India. Video streaming platforms such as Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hotstar, ALT Balaji, etc. provide a subscription to view video content on their websites and apps.According to a statistical report on First Post, there has been a 58% increase in the viewership of online media streaming from the year 2016 and on an average, Indian people spend eight hours and twenty-eight minutes watching videos online on the above-mentioned platforms. With this increase in the viewership, concerns related to the content available on online media streaming platforms have also increased as it is uncensored. For many, it became a matter of great concern after the release of web series like “Sacred Games”, “Game of Thrones”, etc.Regarding this concern, an NGO – Justice for Rights Foundation approached the Delhi High Court for seeking a plea to regulate the content that is available on these online media streaming platforms. The NGO alleged that these platforms show uncertified, vulgar, pornographic, profane, morally unethical and sexually explicit content”, which is unregulated and uncertified for public viewing.The NGO had claimed that web series such as “Sacred Games”, “Game of Thrones” and “Spartacus”, shown on Netflix, contain content that is morally unethical and they depict women in objectifying manner. This could showcase and impact the thought of youth. According to statistics on Statistica, the majority of users of online media platforms lie between the age group of 18-34 years. The NGO pleaded to the court to direct the Ministry to frame guidelines to regulate and certify content available on these online media platforms and remove the legally restricted content with immediate effect.The court had informed the NGO that it will not issue a notice to online media streaming platforms; the court would only seek the government’s response on the matter. Vikram Jatley, the standing counsel for the Central Government, said that the content on the online media platforms is not being regulated by the Ministry. A two bench judgment consisting of Chief Justice Rajendra Menon and Justice V K Rao rejected the petition after Mr. Jaitly submitted to the court that online media platforms do not require to obtain any license by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting.So, for now, the stand taken by the High Court is clear – no license means no regulation. With the upcoming general elections and the winter session of the Parliament getting completed on February 13, 2019, it does not seem that either the Parliament or the Ministry is going to deal with this issue. Or in other words, the viewers can watch content on online media streaming platforms without any restrictions – for at least 6-8 months."

    "headline": "Legality of Bitcoins in India",
    "data": "The revolution of technology has caused a huge shift in almost every sector and impacted each and every sphere of life. The development has been on a rise, thanks to the rapid pace of innovative ideas and think-tanks. Digital currency is an emerging idea, developed over the past few years. The concept has been for quite a time now but gained ground via popularity of Bitcoins. Currency is widely accepted as a medium of exchange of transactions. A virtual currency or cryptocurrency involves the usage of cryptography for its designing to enable transactions. Bitcoin is a type of cryptocurrency and a unique virtual payment system.This innovative brainchild works upon the peer to peer technology, enabling the users to transact without any mediator. Over the past few years, online transactions have changed the definition of money significantly. The virtual currency works without any use of the central administrator or servers and is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Bitcoin is not limited to terrestrial boundaries since it does not require any signatory for its generation. The history of Bitcoins date back to 2009, under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, wherein it was launched.Bitcoin works upon the blockchain technology. A blockchain is a public ledger of all the transactions taking place and is transparent for every user in the network. Bitcoin is formulated through the idea of mining, and a transaction takes place only when the users are able to solve a series of cryptographic codes especially designed for this purpose. A transaction cannot be reversed back once it has been confirmed and processed by the user. The entire network runs in concurrence with the users, in relation to the validity of their transaction and account balance. The system has been designed in such a manner that the maximum number of Bitcoins never exceed 21 million, thereby preventing the devaluation of the currency.Legality of Bitcoins in IndiaFrom a legal standpoint, the usage of cryptocurrency continues to hold a grey perspective in many of the countries. The legal position varies in different parts of the world and its usage is still undefined. The status of bitcoins in India lies in oblivion, at present. In June 2013, The Reserve Bank of India affirmed the use of such digital currencies and identified the challenges related to its governing and viability. Subsequently, on 24 Dec 2013, RBI released a press note and discussing non-authorization of digital currencies by any financial authority. A detailed analysis is required to understand the status of Bitcoin in India.Since Bitcoin is a digital currency and lacks the recognition from any sort of monetary authority, it is outside the ambit of the coins under Sec 2(a) of the Coinage Act, 2011, which defines the governance of coins in India. Currency has been defined under the Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999 under Sec 2(h). Bitcoins, being a cryptocurrency are far from being considered as a currency under the FEMA. However, the Reserve Bank of India is empowered to include any instrument under the definition of currency, by issuing an appropriate bulletin.The RBI is meticulously observing the applicability of Bitcoins and the decision of several other financial authorities such as SEBI towards the former. The Central Government has also been bestowed with similar power for the inclusion of securities under the definition of security. In 2000, RBI exercised its power of inclusion to bring credit cards under the ambit of currency. So, there are such routes available for the legalization of Bitcoins in India.However, presently the RBI is unable to administer the applicability of Bitcoins in the nation. Under the Sales of Good Act, 1930, the price is considered to be a crucial element in the enforcement of a transaction. If Bitcoins are considered to be a property for the purpose of transactions, it would mount to a barter or exchange transaction, which raises questions upon the enforceability of the transaction under the statute. But since the transaction of Bitcoins is not violative of public policy through any means and also forms a lawful consideration, it might be enforceable under the Indian Contract Act, 1872. Bitcoins have gained ground in various contexts and simultaneously posed several challenges relating to its taxability. Under the Income Tax Act, 1961, Sec 2(14) entails securities and the properties held by an assessee and might include Bitcoins as capital assets. The users involved in the transaction of Bitcoins can be made to pay taxes upon treating the Bitcoins as a capital gain.In 2018, the Ministry of Finance reportedly set up a committee for drafting a framework regulating the cryptocurrencies. The committee is being headed by Subhash Chandra Garg, Secretary of Department of Economic Affairs. The committee is tasked with studying of all the cryptocurrencies inclusive of Bitcoins. However, the Ministry of Finance has reportedly clarified that the panel is pursuing the matter with due caution in absence of a globally acceptable solution and there is no urgent need for cryptocurrency regulation, as said by Sh. Pon Radhakrishnan, in Lok Sabha.Bank of International Settlements (BIS) is an international financial institution owned by various central banks, including the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). In Jun 2018, it published a report claiming that cryptocurrencies and the like could feasibly destabilize the traditional banking structure around the world. Thereafter, according to one of the members of the inter-ministerial committee,If Bitcoin and other digital currencies are going to be allowed to be used for payments then whether it will end up destabilizing the fiat currency is a major concern.The Financial Stability Board (FSB) is an international body that monitors and makes recommendations about the global financial system. The FSB promotes international financial stability; it does so by coordinating national financial authorities and international standard-setting bodies as they work toward developing strong regulatory, supervisory and other financial sector policies. It fosters a level playing field by encouraging coherent implementation of these policies across sectors and jurisdictions.The members of FSB include The Securities and Exchange Board of India, the RBI and the Ministry of Finance, along with 23 other countries plus international organizations such as the European Commission, the Bank for International Settlements, the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank. FSB published a report on Oct 10, 2018, which sets out the analysis behind the FSB’s proactive assessment of the potential implications of crypto-assets for financial stability. In lieu of FSB’s report, The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in its report on Dec 28, 2018, stated that cryptocurrencies are not a threat presently but a constant monitoring is required, considering its increasing popularity and risks associated with it. According to the report,“The market continues to evolve rapidly, however, and this initial assessment could change if crypto assets were to become more widely used or interconnected with the core of the regulated financial system,” the central bank detailed. “Cryptocurrencies need constant monitoring on overall financial stability considerations, given the rapid expansion in their usage,” the RBI concluded. The central bank’s latest report echoes its annual report which states that “Though cryptocurrency may not currently pose systemic risks, its increasing popularity leading to price bubbles raises serious concerns for consumer and investor protection, and market integrity.”A public interest litigation, Writ Petition (Civil) no. 1076 of 2017, has been filed under Article 32 of the Indian constitution by Advocate Dwaipayan Bhowmick regarding the laws and regulations for Bitcoins in India. The honourable Supreme Court has issued notices to several ministries such as Ministry of Law, Information Technology, Finance and market regulators such as Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and RBI, demanding for setup of an administerial structure for digital currency and also for such currencies to be made answerable by the exchequer.Subsequently, several petitions have been filed in the court in the context of legality of Bitcoins. In April 2017, the Central Government instituted an inter-disciplinary committee, comprising nine members including representatives from RBI, SBI, NITI Aayog and Department of Financial Services, for the examination of the prevailing structure of the cryptocurrency in India. In August 2017, an inter-ministerial report was submitted to the Centre by the Department of Economic Affairs but the details of the report were not made public. The RBI reiterated its stand vide a press release on 5 Dec 2017, highlighting their concern regarding the usage and applicability of digital currencies, wherein it clarified that it has not provided any sort of sanction or license for conduction of digital currencies such as Bitcoins. The Reserve Bank of India has clearly set forth that operation of such currencies by any user shall be entirely at their individual risk. However, the latest development in the RBI vs Cryptocurrency case is that the Apex Court has fixed February 26, 2019, for further hearing of the case. Earlier, it was scheduled on Jan 15 but was adjourned due to the absence of senior advocates for both the sides.The present status about Bitcoins is that it has not been recognized as a legal tender, however, this does not mean the currency has been rendered illegal. Not being considered as a legal tender only mounts to it, not being accepted for the purpose of making a financial transaction. Bitcoins entail a broad spectrum for the economy and various opportunities for the growth of market and people. The onus lies on the Central Government to establish an operational structure for Bitcoins which does not restrict it completely and allows the creation of a new paradigm altogether."

    "headline": "AI Devices & Legal Issues",
    "data": "AI Devices & Legal IssuesWith the rapid advancements in technology, new problems and issues are arising that our IT Act and subsequent rules are unable to handle. One of such issues is AI-based devices. There are many computing devices and software which we have been using for a long time now and our law is being amended or interpreted to an extent to deal with issues regarding such technology. So, what is the problem in dealing with AI?For answering that, we must first know what AI is. AI is a machine or a program with the capacity to tackle issues, learning from past encounters and information and changing its capacity as indicated by circumstances, much the same as humans. For example, smart cars, smart TVs, AI robots, smart house security systems etc.The conclusion that we draw from the above definition is that an AI device has the brain of its own and consequently it can analyze its surrounding, think, judge and act accordingly. So, it becomes vital to discuss six major problems and issues before the Indian legal system with the developments in AI technology.AI devices can think and act themselves, so who will be held liable for an offence committed by them? The software engineer of its source code, the assembling organization, the customer utilizing the device or the device itself. Switzerland confronted that very issue when an AI device purchased illegal substances on the web. Let’s take an example, suppose a road accident took place by a smart car’s negligence and some damages are caused. So, who is going to be held liable for the accident?The law will say the one who is controlling the car will be held liable. But the car is controlling itself, so is it possible to hold car liable? Well, one may say that since the card had caused the accident, it would be best to destroy or disable it. Though it is a possible solution for small or cheaper AI devices but when we talk about an automatic car or a robot worth crores of rupees, it will not be possible to destroy them for their small though unlawful acts. For example, if a robot trespasses into someone’s property, and it is destroyed, then it will be like a death sentence to an extremely costly device just for a small trespass, reason being we are unclear whom to sue. Clearly, destruction or disabling does not sound like a good solution to this issue.The technical developments are focussed on incorporating human-like characteristics in AI devices. The United States had officially given rights and legal duties to non-human organizations; it will not be surprising that robots and machines utilizing AI device be granted the same. Facebook has already created AI intelligent enough to develop their own, non-human language. So now, a question arises that will an AI device be permitted to sue if some wrong is committed against them, or can an AI device claim land or a house.As AI devices become more powerful, they may decrease the number of jobs for which human workers are competitive. The impact can be severe especially in a country like India where unemployment is already a severe issue as it could lead to inequality and injustice with humans. Some researchers have argued that even blue-collar and white-collar sectors will be affected. The AI-based devices are more fast, accurate and efficient in working, and hence employees can be replaced by intelligent algorithms. Many jobs requiring a bachelor’s degree can be performed by machines or intelligent software and hence they can take place of humans in the future. Individual jobs will disappear completely, and a few new types of jobs will come into being, however, the number of such jobs will be substantially lesser.Ethics and law are deeply connected, as many legal decisions arise from the interpretation of various ethical issues. AI introduced a completely different dimension to these issues. The way human responds to a situation may be completely different from an AI device because decisions of human are affected by emotions, unlike AI. For example, if a driver-less car is passing through a road where such a situation arises that an accident is unavoidable. The question thus arises is that whose lives should take priority – those of the passengers, the people on road or neither. These problems get even more complicated in the case of robots because most of the robots are designed in a way that they learn from information received from the outside world and then act in ways that even their developers could not have assumed. Hence, unpredictability and the ability to act independently while at the same time not being held responsible for its own acts – is something definitely not ethical.AI introduced a new set of challenges for the traditional copyright and patent laws, for example, consider that a robot developed or assisted in the development of software. Can that Robot become a joint or individual owner of the software and hence can it claim copyright? Will the robot then have an obligation to initiate proceedings in case of infringement? This again takes us back to the issue – can AI be considered as a legal personality?Will an AI-based device be able to understand the consequences of crossing the national border? This issue may not be substantially cofounding but it might become challenging for a victim.From Siri to smart cars to online advertisements, artificial intelligence is right now influencing every aspect of our life. The full range of rewards and risks, that emerge from the use of these advancements have not been completely investigated. Both blue and white-collar sectors will be affected by a potential loss of jobs and that the digitization (and automation) of services is a global phenomenon. This phenomenon, however, is a far-reaching and diversified field of advisory services, particularly regarding labour law and criminal law. Though there are countries which had already cleared their perspective on AI like, Saudi Arabia allowed citizenship to a robot called Sophia while on other hand California banned bots from pretending to be a human, yet, it would be desirable for the future laws, which will hopefully be secured at the international level by uniform standards, to be geared to the technological developments and the increased need for flexibility."

    "headline": "RBI’s Circular on Unauthorized Electronic Payments in PPIs",
    "data": "On January 04, 2019, the RBI notified a new circular dealing[1] with limiting the liability of customers in unauthorized electronic payment transactions in PPIs (Prepaid Payment Instruments) issued by authorized non-banks. This is the third circular notified by the Reserve Bank in less than 18 months on customer liability in unauthorized transactions. It has been issued under Section 10(2) r/w Section 18 of the Payments and Settlement Systems Act, 2003 and it will come into effect from March 01, 2019.Previously, the central bank notified a circular applicable to scheduled banks and small finance banks & payments banks[2] on July 06, 2017 while a similar circular applicable to co-operative banks[3] was notified on December 14, 2017. The latest circular is applicable only to PPIs issued by non-banks and for the PPIs issued by the banks, the July’17 guideline will continue to be applicable.As per the definition given by the RBI,[4] a PPI facilitates purchasing of goods & services against the value stored on the said instrument. This value stored on an instrument represents the value paid by the instrument holder by debit to a bank account, by cash, or by a credit card. The RBI recognizes the following as PPIsSmart cardsInternet accountsInternet walletsMobile accountsMobile walletsPaper VouchersMagnetic Stripe CardsThese PPIs are further classified into four categories – closed, semi-closed, semi-open, and open systems.A closed system payment instrument is issued by an establishment for using at their own establishments only. For example, wallet issued by BigBasket or Delhi Metro smart cards.A semi-closed system payment instrument can be redeemed at clearly identifiable merchants that enter into a specific contract with an issuer to accept the payment. This instrument does not allow a holder to withdraw cash or redeem it. Examples include MobiKwik and Oxigen wallets.A semi-open system payment instrument can be used at any point of sale (POS) terminal i.e. card-accepting merchants. Like a semi-closed system payment instrument, the holder cannot withdraw cash or redeem it. Gift cards can be considered as an example of this system.An open system payment instrument can be used at a POS terminal as well as supports cash withdrawal from ATM machines. Travel cards issued by various banks are a perfect example of open system payment instrument.As of January 03, 2019, the RBI has authorized 48 business entities under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act, 20087 to operate a payment system based on PPIs.[5] Some of the most popular names include Amazon Pay, Delhi Metro Smart Cards, MobiKwik, Oxigen, PayU, PhonePe, m-pesa, etc.This circular classifies electronic payment transactions performed via PPIs into two categories –Remote/Online payment transactions – Transactions which don’t require the physical presence of PPIs at the point of transactions such as wallets, card not present (CNP) transactions, etc.Face–to-face/Proximity payment transactions – Transactions which necessarily require a PPI to be present physically at the point of transactions such as cards, mobile phones, etc.Clause 5 of this circular places following responsibilities on a PPI issuer –To ensure that a customer registers for SMS alerts and wherever possible, email alerts for payment transactions.To mandatorily send SMS alerts for payment transactions and additionally sending email alerts if registeredTo mention contact number/email id for reporting unauthorized payment transactions or notify an objection in SMS/email alertsTo provide customers 24×7 access via website/email/website/dedicated toll-free helpline number for reporting either unauthorised payment transactions or loss of a PPITo provide a direct link for lodging complaint regarding unauthorized payment transactions on the home page of PPI’s website or mobile applicationTo advise customers to notify the PPI issuer about unauthorized payment transactions at the earliest and inform that longer the time taken to notify, higher will be the risk of loss to PPI issuer/customer.To send acknowledgement via auto responses mentioning complaint along with its registration numberTo record time and date of sending alerts to customers and receiving their responseTo take immediate action to prevent any further unauthorised payment transactionsIn addition, clause 9 places an obligation on a PPI issuer to –Clearly define rights and obligations of customers in cases of unauthorized electronic payment transactionsRevise their existing customer relations policy to include customer protection and customer liabilityClearly lay down the mechanism for compensation and prescribe a timeline for effecting such compensationDisplay this policy along with reporting procedure in public domain or website or mobile applicationClause 6 of this circular talks about limiting the liability of customer in different scenarios. This clause also mentions that the contents of this clause must be clearly communicated to all PPI holders.When there is contributory fraud/negligence/deficiency on the part of a PPI customer – Zero liability of a customer (irrespective of whether or not an unauthorized transaction is reported by a customer)Third party breach where deficiency is neither on the PPI’s part nor on a customer’s part but lies elsewhere in the system. The customer has to notify the PPI issuer regarding unauthorized transactions and liability will depend on the number of days lapsed between receipt of transaction alert and reporting of unauthorized transactions by the customer –\n\nWithin 3 days – Zero liability\nWithin 3 to 7 days – ₹10,000 per transaction or transaction value, whichever is lower\nBeyond 7 days – As per the PPI Issuer’s Board Policy\n\nWithin 3 days – Zero liabilityWithin 3 to 7 days – ₹10,000 per transaction or transaction value, whichever is lowerBeyond 7 days – As per the PPI Issuer’s Board PolicyWhen loss is due to a customer’s negligence such as sharing payment credentials – Absolute liability. However, if unauthorized payment transactions occur after reporting by a customer, then the PPI issuer shall bear the loss.Even in cases of customer negligence, a PPI issuer has discretionary power to waive off a customer’s liability.The words contributory fraud or contributory negligence has not been defined in any circular or notification published by the Reserve Bank of India. In legal literature, contributory negligence[6] is a common law tort principle which specifies that the plaintiff through his own actions has contributed to the harm or injury suffered. It can be taken as a defence and if successful, it eliminates the liability of a defendant to pay damages to an injured party i.e. the plaintiff. Over the years, this principle has evolved into comparative negligence[7] – the amount of damages that can be recovered by a plaintiff is based upon the degree of his own negligence which contributed to the injury i.e. liability of a defendant is proportionate.In terms of electronic payment transactions, it can be understood that there is some negligence on the part of a customer, and at the same time, the PPI issuer has failed to comply with its rights and obligations. In such cases, the liability of a customer shall be zero and it shifts entirely on the concerned PPI issuer.Following incidents might be considered under contributory negligence –When there is a compromise of sensitive personal data of customers and further information is gathered about customers using social engineering techniquesWhen a PPI issuer does not comply with the minimum security standards prescribed by the RBI and simultaneously, a customer acts negligently by sharing OTPWhen a PPI issuer updates registered mobile number or email address of a customer without proper authentication and verificationWhen a PPI issuer has not set up efficient fraud prevention and mitigation system which directly or indirectly contributes to unauthorized payment transactionsWhen a PPI issuer does not take appropriate action after a customer reports causing subsequent lossClause 7 & 8 of this circular specifies that –After being notified by a customer, a PPI issuer shall credit the amount involved in unauthorized electronic payment transactions within a period of 10 days into a customer’s account via notional reversal.For crediting this amount, the PPI issuer shall not wait for settlement of any insurance claims.The PPI issuer has to ensure that –\n\nA complaint is resolved within 90 days.\nLiability of a customer is established within the said period.\n\nA complaint is resolved within 90 days.Liability of a customer is established within the said period.The customer is compensated as per clause 6 of this circular.If a PPI issuer fails to resolve a complaint and establish a customer’s liability, the amount as prescribed in clause 6 must be paid to a customer irrespective of whether there is customer negligence or not.Considering the exponentially increasing financial frauds via debit/credit cards, internet banking, and mobile wallets, it is imperative for a regulator to clearly define rights and liabilities of two major stakeholders – the service provider and the customer. This circular is indeed a positive step towards protecting the interests of customers in cases of unauthorized electronic payment transactions from prepaid payment instruments (PPIs). This circular also clarifies that the burden of proving a customer’s liability lies with the PPI issuer. With this circular coming into effect from March 01, 2019, the customers will finally have a remedy and properly defined procedure to avail that remedy in cases of unauthorized electronic payment transactions from their PPIs.Co-authored by Titiksha Seth and Raj Pagariya.References[1] Reserve Bank of India.

    "headline": "India’s evolving data privacy jurisprudence – It’s 2019 and we’re missing the point!",
    "data": "Much has been said already about the recent order of the MHA under Section 69 of the IT Act notifying ten agencies to “intercept, monitor or decrypt” “information generated, transmitted, received or stored” in any computer resource. While it is controversial in the context of a feared police state of mass surveillance, the notification not only extends to intermediaries and service providers but to each and every citizen as well.\nThe notified agencies are now empowered to ask you or me to hand over our devices if it is in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above or for investigation of any offence.\nNow, there is perhaps nothing wrong with the notification but something entirely wrong with Section 69 of the Act itself. Under this authority now, the office of Commissioner of Police, Delhi can seek any “computer resource” and not data when investigating offences, including an individual’s device, the server that perhaps routed his email and the device of someone who received the email. On more fronts than one, this would be a violation of an individual’s fundamental rights and a juxtaposition within the law enforcement ecosystem. And I’m not jumping into the debate about mass surveillance and the overarching prevalence of the big brother!\nWhat intrigues me more is the floating of The Information Technology [Intermediaries Guidelines (Amendment) Rules], 2018 for public comments in this wave. After seeing the spite of the cyber criminals across the world and working with victims of sensitive crimes, I advocate for access to intermediary data by law enforcement (for investigation) and the courts (for delivery of justice) but in a way that does not impugn our privacy rights.\nUndoubtedly, the level of access to both these institutions (or others) has to be different and with some level of accountability. A much-needed authority for law enforcement and “appropriate government” to investigate offences has been added along with a provision for removal of content under this amendment to the IT Rules. But here is what we are missing – when chalking out how the intermediary shall help a government agency, Rule 5 has been worded to provide such information or assistance as asked by the government agency. It is to be noted here that this has nothing to do with Section 69, conditions therein or the notification but requires situations as wide as investigation or detection or prosecution or prevention of offence(s) for the intermediary to assist. This is the exact opposite of the level of access mentioned earlier.\nWhile the jurisprudence on data privacy evolves in India, we must take a step back and look at data itself; for data is something we haven’t defined in the context of privacy and disclosure. I’d like to point the readers to Section 2703 of the Stored Communications Act in the USA that creates a distinction between content and non-content data. While non-content data covers things such as subscriber information and other meta-data (size of a message, origination IP etc.) about anything (an email, text message etc.), content data covers the actual contents of the communication (text, video, attachments etc.).\nAlthough the line between [content and non-content] occasionally blurs, in most cases the line is clear: it is the line between a message that a person wants to communicate and information about when and how he does so. Historically now, non-content data has been something that can be obtained by law enforcement or other agencies upon direct requests but for content data, a court would have to order (given the courts have been placed at the apex). While it does not solve the problem of snooping and privacy breaches, it does bring some structure and accountability. Companies have been complying to the directive and have set procedures such as subpoenas, court orders and search warrants which we come across while reading international literature. The process in the Indian law enforcement ecosystem is different and majorly, not defined.\nIf the data privacy jurisprudence in India is to evolve and privacy is to be established in some construct, first these definitional challenges need to be overcome and it should come as a wake up call to lawmakers that when we are creating regulation for assistance from intermediaries, something as wide as such information or assistance as asked for will only increase privacy concerns."

    "headline": "Bombay HC denies bail under Section 67A",
    "data": "It is a rare sight to see an Indian court convicting an accused under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Earlier this year in March 2018, a Judicial Magistrate First Class Court in Purba Medinipur district, West Bengal convicted an accused with five years of imprisonment in a revenge porn case. Considering that most of the offences under the IT Act, 2000 are bailable, this is probably the very first instance when a High Court has denied bail to an accused.In the case of Akshay Sripad Rao v. The State of Maharashtra (CrBA 2304/17), the accused is facing trial (RCC 1171/2017) before the Judicial Magistrate First Class, Nashik for offences under Section 67, 67A of the Information Technology Act, 2000 along with Section 354A, 354D of the Indian Penal Code, 1860. He had filed a bail application before the Bombay HC under Section 439 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973. The contents of FIR revealed that the accused had disrobed the victim, made physical contact and advances involving unwelcome and explicit sexual overtures.He had also taken her nude photographs and uploaded them on 145 different porn websites.It was also brought to the knowledge of the court that the accused had done the same with another victim.Forensic analysis of accused’s seized laptop and mobile phone revealed that he had uploaded victim’s photos from these devices.Justice Anuja Prabhudessai, who was presiding over this case, made following observations –The photos uploaded on various porn sites contain sexually explicit act/conduct.The material on record prima facie shows that accused has committed an offence falling under the above-mentioned provisions.Since the victims are two young girls, there are definite chances that the accused will pressurise the victims and eventually, thwart the course of justice.Based upon the above opinion, the honourable Judge did not find this case as a fit case to be granted bail at this stage of the trial. Further, the lower court was accordingly ordered to frame the charges and record the evidence of the victims within a period of four months from the date of this order.The increased penetration rate has indeed widened the attack surface area for the perpetrators to exploit. With the IT Act, 2000 proving to be inadequate in various dimensions, the onus now lies on the courts to ensure that appropriate remedies are given to the victims while at the same time, they are not denied justice due to a loophole or a grey area in the existing laws.You can download the PDF file of this order by clicking here."

    "headline": "How an Internet search took a life – The Story of Wei Zexi",
    "data": "The biggest irony of our generation is that WhatsApp has become a verb.This quote was written by Mr Nitish Chandan, our Founder in November 2015 and we accordingly posted on Facebook here. An exactly similar statement can be made when it comes to the search-engine giant Google. As of July 2018, Google has a staggering 86.2% market share worldwide. The market hold is evident from the fact that phrases such as Can you please search this on Google? has become Why don’t you Google this? or from Zara Google pe search karna to Google karna zara.The previous paragraph holds true for most of the countries across the globe except China. Since as early as 2012, China has blocked Google and all its related services via the Great Firewall of China. So, as far as search engines are concerned, Baidu is a synonym in China with a market share of 66.2%. Here in this post, we will be discussing a case study where a promoted result in a search caused the death of a Chinese citizen named Wei Zexi.Those who are familiar with online marketing, they definitely know that service providers providing their services free-of-cost thrive on collecting user behavioural data to utilise it for paid advertisements on their platforms by third-parties. Terms such as cost-per-click, conversion rate, click-through-rate, etc. are some of the phrases that play a vital role in online marketing. The same business model is adopted by Facebook, Google, as well as Baidu.In 2014, Wei Zexi, a University student was diagnosed with a rare tissue cancer called as synovial sarcoma. His family started looking out for other forms of treatments after radiation and chemotherapy were completed. They contacted major hospitals across the country and were given the same response – this cancer is untreatable. He was searching on Baidu and through a promoted result (i.e. paid to advertise) on the platform, he found that the Second Hospital of the Beijing Armed Police Corps in Beijing was providing immunotherapy treatments to patients with his illness.Within a week after seeing this search result, they went to Bejing to meet the doctor. After looking at Wei’s reports, the doctor informed them that Wei should immediately avail the treatment to cure cancer. They added that this technology of treatment has been developed by Stanford and it is being practised from the last twenty years with a success rate of 8.9%.His family borrowed around 2,00,00 renminbi (~30,000 USD or ₹ 21.14 lakhs) for his treatment at this state military-run hospital. As a result of the treatment, cancer reached his lungs and the doctors at the hospital stated that Wei would not even be able to live for more than a month or two. Also, they put the blame on Wei’s family by telling that they were late in availing the treatment.Wei shared his experience as an answer to the question What do you think is the greatest evil of human nature? on Zhihu, a Chinese QA website. According to his answer, he and his family considered the search results credible because of three reasons –\n\nThis was a state military-run hospital and appeared on the top of Baidu’s search results\nThe attending doctor had appeared on many mainstream platforms in China\nThey were informed that this technology has been developed by Stanford and has a success rate of 8.9%\n\nThis was a state military-run hospital and appeared on the top of Baidu’s search resultsThe attending doctor had appeared on many mainstream platforms in ChinaThey were informed that this technology has been developed by Stanford and has a success rate of 8.9%Further, in his answer, Wei also mentioned that with the help of one of his friends studying in the USA, he checked and contacted many prominent hospitals of America and came to know that this technology has been eliminated in the clinical stage 20 years ago because it was too inefficient. There is no hospital in the US where treatment is provided using this technology. His answer was last edited on February 26, 2016, and it has been endorsed by more than 66,000 users so far. His body eventually gave up against cancer on April 12, 2016.Xinhua, the state-run newspaper of China widely condemned Baidu for Wei’s death. Xinhua stated that making money by allowing companies to pay for better search placements is equivalent to putting a good tool in the hands of interest seekers with bad intentions. Many internet users in China questioned about the advertisement practices employed by Baidu and referred them as 百毒, or “100 poisons.” On May 2, 2016, the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC) announced that it would conduct a joint investigation into the incident along with the State Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) & National Health and Planning Commission (NHCP).Many government and military authorities also started their investigation into the state military-run hospital immediately after the incident. As a result, Baidu’s shares fell by around 14% after the news about Wei’s death went viral and cost them around 2 billion renminbi in profits over the next three months. The Communist Party’s flagship publication, the People’s Daily thoroughly questioned Baidu’s corporate ethics. In a commentary on the incident published on their website, they mentioned thatCompanies that were involved in services that deal with human life should be particularly conscientious of their duties when conducting their businesses. Since more than a billion Internet users trust Baidu for their search engine and other online services, the company is thus responsible for trust and is obligated to take up their social responsibilities.The joint investigation by CAC, SAIC, and NHCP concluded that Baidu’s pay-for-placement strategy influenced Wei’s decision-making process and eventually, his medical choice. It was found that unlike other platforms like Google and Yahoo, there is no clear distinction between paid results and general search results. As a result, Baidu was ordered by the regulators to take the following steps –\n\nTo add eye-catching markers for paid placements\nTo limit the advertisements on a page to 30%\nTo change the bidding mechanism for ranking of search results\nTo exclude money from the factors determining the ranking of organizations\n\nTo add eye-catching markers for paid placementsTo limit the advertisements on a page to 30%To change the bidding mechanism for ranking of search resultsTo exclude money from the factors determining the ranking of organizationsIn a separate investigation, the hospital was found to be illegally working with a private healthcare business, unlawfully advertising services, and using unauthorized clinical technology.After the incident, one spokeswoman for Baidu expressed deepest condolences for Wei’s death and clarified that the company will cooperate in the investigation to ensure a crackdown on illegal activities. She added that Baidu will give no quarter to fake information or illegal activities online as it is a trusted company and they uphold extremely high standards to make our platform safe and trustworthy.After the investigation was concluded, Baidu released a public statement for accepting the investigation results and implementing the recommendations suggested by the regulatory bodies. In addition, they also allocated a fund of 1 billion renminbi (~ USD 147.92 million) for giving compensation to the users who have suffered demonstrable economic harm from the paid results.While researching about this incident and reading a number of articles, it is safe to state that this was not the first time that Baidu has been accused of mishandling health-related information. In January 2016, it was alleged that Baidu has sold the management rights of a haemophilia online forum to an unlicensed private hospital. This hospital deleted every comment challenging its credentials and extensively used the platform for self-promotion. This incident was also mentioned by Wei in his answer. There was one more incident in 2010 when China’s state-run TV channel accused Baidu of promoting the sale of counterfeit drugs. The death of Wei Zexi is one such incident which is available in the public domain, however, there may be many cases which have not yet seen the light of the day.The end users, just like you and me, often have tendencies to trust whatever we see on our Facebook timeline or a website found via a search engine or a message we receive on WhatsApp. The recent incidents of mob lynching can serve as a good example of how misleading information available on the Internet can be. At the users’ end, there is an implied responsibility to cross-check and do not believe in everything they see online. On the other end, the stand taken by the People’s Daily newspaper cannot be altogether denied as the services provided by tech gains indeed affect the public life at large. Personally, the practice of showing no demarcation between a paid result and a general result is unfair, and to an extent, uncompetitive. And with previous allegations of similar incidents happening, the regulators should have imposed exemplary fines in order to set an example, which they clearly missed."

    "headline": "Accessing Banned Websites into Jail: Egypt and Cyber Law",
    "data": "Accessing Banned Websites into Jail: Egypt & Cyber LawAccess to the Internet, some may say is totally fundamental to one’s rights as a citizen. So much so that courts across the world have begun saying this. As a global community of Internet users, we are far ahead of debates about the whole existence of the Internet and whether or not it was made for the purposes that it is being used for today. The Internet facilitates more than just communication today that goes far beyond information exchange now. Everything under the sun from business transactions to grocery shopping has moved to these online spaces and there is no stopping it. In the midst of all this, inevitably so, the Internet has been used by extremists to propagate agendas, spread violence, promote hatred etc. among communities and in many situations, they have been able to recruit people into their organisations breaking nations from within – radicalisation. There are things like these and those that are against a country’s laws like the depiction of certain important figures in obscene settings. Now it so happens that countries, on many occasions, order for blocking of certain websites to be accessed from within their geographical territories. Often these are soft blocks possible to be circumvented by using technologies like VPN (meaning routing your request through another that is likely to have access to the content). This is often looked at as a basic ingredient to an individual’s right to freedom and expression because they should have the right to choose the content they consume and who they interact with so long as it doesn’t stray outside the boundaries of the law. Now, Egypt has come up with a law about two months ago that empowers courts to issue blocking orders against websites/services in the backdrop of national security (which is understandable). What this law does additionally is that it now makes it a criminal offence to access these websites and fixes the quantum of punishment at one year. Further, it goes on to criminalise sharing of content from any such blocked website and fixes the quantum of punishment at two years. The practice of Internet censorship was already prevalent in Egypt and this law has apparently formalized the process. In addition, Egypt is ranked at the 161st position out of 180 in RSF’s World Press Freedom Index and it is considered to be one of the world’s biggest jailers of journalists.  Egypt has also passed another law declaring social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers as a media organization. All such social media accounts will now have to work under the supervision of state-appointed media supervisory council.Increasingly over the years now, countries like China, Russia, Iran and Egypt have taken the censorship route to regulate the Internet creating borders in the cyberspace. While we do not comment for or against such models but criminalising access to websites is a stretch. How do you feel about it?"

    "headline": "Obscenity & the Indian Law",
    "data": "Obscenity & the Indian LawThe best way to define obscenity is actually to not define it. Not because it would be lewd, overreaching or offensive in diktat but because no one has actually done it. Obscenity changes with time, values, society, popular culture etc. The number of things that have a direct impact on the standards and level of obscenity are many and locking them into one line or a few lines is not possible.  The legal provisions related to obscenity, however, are mainly given under the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (herein referred to as IPC) and the Information Technology Act, 2000 (herein referred to as IT Act) as far as India is concerned.The concept of obscenity differs from nation to nation and it depends on the moral and cultural values that have shaped that country. Indian society has always been very conservative about girls and the purity of woman has always been considered essential to sustain a family’s reputation.The definition of obscenity still isn’t clear. It changes with time and depends on the factual circumstances of the case. What was considered obscenity 30 years ago, might not be considered so now. India has always adopted tests from other countries to determine the element of obscenity in its court cases. The tests have changed over time according to its adaptiveness in the continuously evolving society.The test of obscenity has been laid by several countries based on certain moral principles and decency codes of the particular country. Few of these tests have been adopted by the Indian courts over time to determine obscenity.EnglandThe test to determine obscenity under English Law was first laid down in R vs. Hicklin case. The statutory interpretation of the word obscene as given under the Obscene Publications Act, 1857 was the issue. According to the Queen’s Bench, all the materials depraving and corrupting the minds open to immoral influences was considered obscene, regardless of its literary merit. Here, the intention was considered immaterial. If any portion of the work or publication was considered obscene even if that portion was out of context, it didn’t matter, the entire work could be outlawed.The United StatesIn 1957, the US court developed a new test for obscenity in Roth vs. United States. It was decided that only those sex-related materials which had the capability of generating prurient interest or lustful thoughts would fall under the category of obscene. This had to be judged from the point of view of an average person following community standards, unlike the previous test which focused only on the susceptible readers i.e. the vulnerable sections of the society such as children or weak-minded adults.Here, it was also held that obscenity is not constitutionally protected speech or press. The materials which cause normal healthy sexual desires will not come under the purview of obscene, the interest shown has to be shameful interest in nudity, sex or excretion. The Roth test is, therefore, sharper and narrower compared to the Hicklin test as it does not cover all the materials that might corrupt but limits itself to the dominant theme of the material and checks whether if taken as a whole has any redeeming social value or not.In 1966, in Memoirs v. Massachusetts, the US court expanded the Roth test and stated that the last part of the definition i.e. utterly without redeeming social importance element had to be proved to classify something as obscene.In 1973, the Miller test or the three-prong obscenity test was developed in Miller v. California. This test was for determining what kind of speech and expression can be classified as obscene. The test is based on 3 conditions and a piece of work would be considered obscene only if all the conditions were satisfied. The first two conditions are governed by the community standard while the third prong is governed by what is reasonable to a person of the US as a whole. The national reasonable standard acts as a check on the community standard allowing protection for works that in a certain community might be obscene but at the national level, it should have to redeem social value. This could create conflicting interest between communities as what is treated as obscene by one community could have been treated differently by another.Fixing national standards for what appeals to be prurient or offensive is not possible practically. The concept of considering a speech obscene if it didn’t have some value was so vague. Several questions arise here like the true connotations of value. On what factors, will a speech be considered valuable or value-less by the court? Why would the government and not the citizens have all the rights to decide? The law relating to obscenity was unclear and writers were afraid of the ‘value’ factor and therefore, were hesitant to publish their works to avoid litigation and punishments. So, the Miller test not only led to the elimination of obscenity but also legitimate speech.Legal ProvisionsThe words obscene and obscenity have not been defined in the IPC. Section 292 of IPC in simple terms state that if any material is taken as a whole is lascivious or appeals to prurient interest and tends to deprave and corrupt the persons who read, see or hear the matter contained will come under the purview of obscenity. Section 293 also bans the selling of obscene objects to young persons and prescribes punishments for the same.The provisions of Section 292 are not applicable to works done in public interest such as in cases of science, literature or religious purposes. Section 292 also conflicts with Article 19(2) of the constitution which is about the freedom of speech and expression, however, the Constitution provides that the fundamental rights are subjected to reasonable restrictions to prevent indecency in public.The punishment for publishing of obscene material in electronic form is given under Sec 67 of IT Act. It is important to note that any offence related to obscenity in electronic form can only be tried under the IT Act and not IPC as Section 81 of the IT Act clearly states its overriding effect. But sometimes if there is a need, provisions of both the IT Act as well as IPC are considered together, as done in the case of Avnish Bajaj v. State (NCT of Delhi). Since the Internet is global and dynamic in nature, we have Section 75 of the IT Act taking care of the issues related to electronic transmission of obscene material from other jurisdictions as well.Sec 2(c), Sec 3, Sec 4 of the Indecent Representation of Women Prohibition Act, 1986 also deal with the prohibition of such acts. The Cable Television Networks Regulation Act, 1995 prohibits telecast of obscene acts on television. Section 4 and Sec 5A of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 provides for the examination of films before release. The Young Persons Harmful Publication Act, 1956 prohibits publications which can corrupt a child. Section 294 of the IPC punishes a person for committing obscene acts in public place and also for singing obscene songs. Similarly, Section 354 and Section 509 of IPC are also applicable for punishing crimes against sexual harassment of women at the workplace.Case LawsIn 1965 judgement of Ranjit D. Udeshi v. State of Maharashtra, the SC had adopted the English Hicklin test which had raised a few problems. The Sec 292 of IPC required any material to be taken as a whole whereas the Hicklin test required the material content to be checked in isolation. So there was a conflict of interest between the two. There were other loopholes too because of which the courts started undermining the Hicklin test. The conditions of the Hicklin test were liberalized and applied until the case of Aveek Sarkar.In 2006, the Supreme Court in the case of Ajay Goswami v. UOI proposed a new test called as responsible reader test wherein a reader should be cautious in this era of technology. With respect to the online form of obscenity, we have cases like Avnish Bajaj v. State, wherein the question was whether the website was responsible for the publication of the MMS or not. The website which was just an intermediary was held responsible for the same in this case. In another case, M. Saravanan & Dr. L. Prakash v. State, a doctor was punished under Section 67 IT Act for online distribution of lewd photos and videos of a woman just for the purpose of making money.In the case of Aveek Sarkar v. State of West Bengal (2014), the Supreme Court had said nude can’t be considered obscene per se under the meaning of Sec. 292 unless it arouses a feeling of sexual desire. In this particular case after 50 years of the application of the Hicklin test, the court finally disapproved it and adopted the Roth test. The intention behind it was to decide cases keeping in mind the contemporary national standards and not the group of susceptible persons. But the problem is that the test does not contemplate differential standards for different community and proceeds on a simple basis. Here, only it is the nature of work that matters and whether such work is accepted by society at large or not. There was a lot of confusion as to what exactly constituted obscenity. How can the court draw a different line of a threshold for historically respectable figures in these cases? How do they decide the threshold? But at least people accepted the fact that obscenity is an exception to freedom of speech.In 2015, the AIB group was also in the headlines for its roast show AIB Knockout wherein there were multiple instances where a celebrity was made fun of allegedly in a very rude and offensive manner. In view of this incident, several complaints were filed. The judgement is yet to come in this case but this is going to be an important precedent in future as this case is going to define the limits of freedom of speech and expression for TV shows involving celebrities and their impact on the society.Summarizing up, the words obscene and obscenity are not defined under IPC. The courts take the pain time and again to determine whether an act is obscene or not. The determining factors like public decency, social morality and cultural variations keep changing with time. Also to be kept in mind is that obscenity is not protected under the freedom of speech and expression clause of the Constitution. So, the court has always stressed the need to promote a culture of open dialogue until and unless it affects the society at large. Besides all this, at an individual level, caution and being a little responsible can prevent you from falling prey to such problems. Prevention is always better than cure!"

    "headline": "Getting Revenge Porn Videos Removed from Twitter [Case Study]",
    "data": "Getting Revenge Porn Videos Removed from TwitterHow many times has a text from your ex-boyfriend/girlfriend made you afraid? If the number is high, the probability that message being threatening or derogatory is equally high. A person being threatened of his/her integrity via illicit images and videos always thinks what went wrong and what can be done now. These pictures and videos are generally taken when you are in a relationship and you trust your partner completely. At the outset, I would want to tell you there is nothing wrong with it. The offender starts the unending approach of sending sinister and ugly demands. These demands can be ransom or the blackmailer may even ask for sexual favours. In most of the cases, the demands are sexual in nature. This entire chain of events is usually referred to as revenge porn aka sextortion. What needs attention in these sensitive cases is how the victim responds to the threats. An ideal response to these threats is to report it to the Law Enforcement Agencies or at least to your parents if you are a minor.There is no denying that the cases related to revenge porn are increasing in India. But most of these cases never see the light of the day. The stigma and the shrewd perspective of the society have always stopped victims from approaching police or the parents in the majority of cases. So,The answer is no. I have personally spoken to many of these victims and it is true that they do not want this to reach their parents. The only thing that they want is to remove any such content published on the Internet. Removing something completely from the Internet may actually not possible. But when the victims know about their videos or photos being uploaded to pornographic websites or social media, they can be definitely removed from the concerned platforms.Recently, we received a case on our WhatsApp Helpline where a video of a girl with her ex-boyfriend was uploaded on Twitter. The video which was doing rounds on the platform for the last 8 months. This video received favourites, retweets, and comments but it was never taken down by the social media giant. The Twitter Account where the video was uploaded was filled with explicit sexual content.The victim informed us about the same and she was feeling helpless in the whole situation. We calmed her down and informed her that she should inform to the Police about it and should take legal action against her ex-boyfriend who had uploaded it under Section 67 & 67 A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. She refused to do so due to the fact that she did not want her parents to know about the entire incident. Since she was already in a serious dilemma, we assured that we will try out best to ensure that the video is taken down. Then, we followed the steps given below. I am penning down these steps one-by-one so that our readers can understand the entire procedure easily.Go to https://help.twitter.com/en\nChose Safety and Security from the left menu.Click on Sensitive Content.\nOn the new page, click on Report private information posted on Twitter\nScroll down to the paragraph that has the heading How do I report that my private information is posted on Twitter? Click on the link that says report that someone has posted your private information. \nA new page with a form will open.\nCarefully fill out the form. You can contact us if you need help in filling the form.Submit the request.You will get an email from Twitter within 48 Hours.\nYou need to upload your photo with a Government issued ID on the link given in the email. This step is taken to ensure that the identity is the same that is being represented in the video or the image.After completing the whole process, you will receive another mail within 48 Hours which will be the resolution taken by Twitter on the matter.\nIn the above-mentioned case where the victim wanted the video to be removed, we received a mail where Twitter suspended the whole account where the video was posted after submitting the request. When I informed the victim about the same, this is how she responded:My name is ***** and I never thought in my life I would go to such a horror, so ex cheated on me and took a video and made it viral after few months. I got to know that it was put everywhere possible on Pornhub, XNXX website, Instagram, Telegram, Twitter and what not. I got to know this through my friends and then later I was so shocked I didn’t know what to do I did everything possible from my end to take them out but it didn’t work then.I searched on Google if I could find help because my friends told me just see if I could get any cybercrime people who can help me with this , then I found this number and I messaged and told them everything within few days everything was taken out .. thanks to The Cyber Blog India team. Without their help, I wouldn’t have been able to do anything. Now I’m strong enough to face my trouble this is true, if I hadn’t been strong, I would’ve ended up ending my life but they kept me going and that guy will learn a lesson , if anyone has gone through my situation please be strong don’t take foolish decisions by ending lives think twice. You can take help of The Cyber Blog India and they will surely help you. This is my story and it did end well.This is just one of the cases we receive on a regular basis in which we have helped a victim who was willing to ask for the help and was courageous enough to take the necessary steps. "

    "headline": "Our Recommendations to the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018",
    "data": "The Cyber Blog India’s Recommendations to the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018Ministry of Electronics & Information Technology has invited public comments on the Draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018. This post contains recommendations made by us to the Ministry. These recommendations can be downloaded in the form of a PDF file from here. (Please refer to the PDF document for acronyms.)Issue 1: Scope of the RightThe scope of the right given under Section 27 of the bill is limited only to restriction or prevention of a disclosure of a data principal’s data by a data fiduciary. This right can be availed when such disclosure has –Either served the purpose or it is no longer necessaryConsent given under Section 12 has been withdrawnDisclosure made in the contravention of existing lawsIn addition, clause (2) of Section 27 states that for availing this right, it must override the right to freedom of speech and expression and the right to information of any citizen.Prima facie, the scope under this section does not cover the deletion or erasure of a data principal’s data stored by a data fiduciary. Comparing this right with similar rights given under various national and international regimes, the scope of this right must be widened. Though this right has gained prominence only in the last decade or so, it is equated with the Right to Erasure.As per Article 17 (Right to Erasure – ‘right to be forgotten’) of GDPR, the grounds for availing this right are more or less same, but the extent is not. Article 17 of GDPR states that a data subject has a right to erasure of personal data concerning him or her without undue delay and the controller has an obligation to erase the personal data of a data subject on the basis of mentioned grounds. Similarly, The UK DPA 2018 has recognized the same right under its Schedule 6.The question of whether an individual has a right to be forgotten which includes erasure of data has been brought up before the Indian Courts as well. Such courts include the High Courts of Gujarat, Delhi, and Karnataka. In February 2017, the Karnataka High Court recognised the right to be forgotten for removal of the petitioner’s name from various case reports publicly available results via search engines.[1] According to the Justice Anand Byrareddy who presided over this case, this right can be availed in cases involving women in general and highly sensitive cases involving rape or affecting the modesty and reputation of the person concerned.”Since the bill recognises various rights of data principals with respect to their data and privacy, the right given under Section 27 shall also incorporate the right to erasure/deletion of data.Possible SolutionsAppropriate modifications can be made in the present Section 27 of the bill by including words such as deletion and erasure. Along with this, additional grounds or restrictions can be added under Section 27(1) for availing this right.An altogether different section can be added under Chapter VI of the bill for erasure or deletion of data. This section should cover situations where personal videos of victims are uploaded on online platforms without their consent e. revenge pornography cases. Misuse of such a right can be prevented by narrowing the scope of the right using the Balancing principle, as discussed in Chapter 5 of the report.Right to erasure can also work as a right to be deidentified from the information stored with a data fiduciary. “Deidentification” has been defined by Section 18 of Australia’s ACT IPA 2014 which is on the similar lines as the definition of “anonymisation” given under Section 3(2) of the bill.Issue 2 – Procedure for Exercising the RightAs per clause (4) of Section 27, a data principle can exercise his or her right to be forgotten by filing an application with the Adjudicating Officer. For the other rights given under Chapter VI of the bill, Section 28 lays down the procedure for exercising those rights by making a request in writing to the concerned data fiduciary. This procedure for exercising the right to be forgotten by stating that the data fiduciaries will be burdened with content removal requests and their decision will be biased towards their own interests. Further, the Committee stated that a data fiduciary is not capable of deciding between the statutory right to be forgotten and the fundamental rights to free speech and information.Taking into consideration that an Adjudicating Officer (AO) is designated for each state at its capital, the pendency of cases can very well be inferred from the existing judicial system. On the other hand, India has a number of states covering vast geographical areas. For a data principal to appear at each hearing on his application, travelling costs and other practical factors may demotivate a data principal and result in losing the trust in the legal setup prescribed by the bill.Or for a body corporate having its registered office in Mumbai, the same factors will come into play if they are called to appear before any Adjudicating Officer of the north-eastern states.Possible SolutionsJust like other rights given under Chapter VI of the bill, the data fiduciaries shall be given an opportunity to erase or delete the data of a data principal. If the interests of a data principal supersede the interests of a data fiduciary in continuing to store it, the data must be deleted. For restrictions on the right to erasure, Recitals 65, 66, and 73 of the GDPR along with Section 35 & 36 of Malaysian PDPA 2010 can be referred to.A statutory time limit of up to 30 days must be prescribed for dealing with such a request. A similar time-limit of 36 hours has also been prescribed under Rule 3(4) of the Information Technology (Intermediaries Guidelines) Rules, 2011.If a request for erasure or deletion of data is received or an order from an Adjudicating Officer has been received regarding the same, it must be the duty of a data fiduciary to inform all other data fiduciaries/processors with whom the data was shared. This duty has been recognised by Section 48 of UK DPA 2018 which further adds an obligation to inform all the recipients e. all the parties with whom data fiduciary had shared the data to erase it. A similar obligation has also been enforced under sub-clause (b) of Section 22(2) of the Singapore PDPA 2012.If a data principal is not satisfied with the response given by a data fiduciary, he can follow the standard procedure of filing an application with the Adjudicating Officer.Issue 3 – No Exemption to the Armed ForcesUnder Chapter IX, the bill grants exemptions to certain purposes which are laid down from Section 42 to 48. These exemptions include processing of personal data for –Security of the statePrevention, detection, investigation, and processing of contraventions of lawProcessing for legal proceedingsResearch, archiving or statistical purposesPersonal or domestic purposesJournalistic purposesManual processing by small entitiesAfter going through various legislation enacted by the countries across the world, one can arrive at a conclusion that the armed forces of a country must be given a specific exemption under a data protection framework as the processes and procedures of the Armed Forces are altogether different from the procedure established by the law of the land for civil and criminal courts.Section 70 of APA 1988, Section 7(3)(c.1) under Division I of PIPEDA, 2000, Section 23 of NZPA 1993, and Clause 7 Schedule 11 of UK DPA 2018 are some of the provisions of legislation across the world where Armed/Defense forces have been granted exemption from the national data protection framework in some way or the other.Possible SolutionsA separate section under Chapter IX can be added for granting an exemption to Armed Forces, as done by the legislation mentioned above.The exemption given under Section 42 of the bill e. Security of the State can be defined under Section 2 to include armed forces. For this definition, the definition of the phrase national interest given under Section 2 of Singapore PDPA, 2012 can be referred to. This phrase has been defined as“national interest includes national defence, national security, public security, the maintenance of essential services and the conduct of international affairs.”Issue 4 – Bailable & Non-bailableChapter XIII in the bill lays down various offences related to personal data of a data principal. This chapter also contains provisions when offences are done by either companies or Central/State government departments. After around 18 years of the enactment of the Information Technology Act, 2000, we have not been able to realize its potential due to non-consideration of the sensitivity of the harm involved while classifying an offence as bailable and non-bailable. Here in the same chapter, Section 93 specifies that the offences defined in this act are cognizable and non-bailable without considering the sensitivity of the data.Possible SolutionWhether an offence should be bailable or not should depend on the nature of the data affected. For offences involving sensitive personal data, the offences shall remain non-bailable while for the offences involving disclosure of personal data, the offences should be bailable.Issue 5 – Power to InvestigateAnother reason for non-realization of full potential of the Information Technology Act, 2000 is the power of investigation resting with a police officer, not below the rank of Inspector. The same status quo has been incorporated in the bill under Section 94. This section may be efficiently applicable in urban areas, while the same statement might not hold true for the police stations in suburban or rural areas as they are often headed by a police officer having the rank of Sub-Inspector. In addition, there is generally one police officer per police station having the rank of Inspector who is also designated as the station incharge while there are at least 2-3 subordinate officers having the rank of sub-inspector.Possible SolutionThe power to investigate for the offences given under the bill shall be given to a police officer, not below the rank of a sub-inspector.Issue 6 – Blanket Powers of DPASection 60 & 61 under Chapter X of the bill discusses various powers, functions, and responsibilities along with a prescription of standard Codes of Practice by the Data Protection Authority (DPA). These powers are given with respect to definitions of processing given u/s 3(32), data fiduciary given u/s 3(13), and data principal u/s 3(14). The provisions given under these sections give a blanket power to DPA to regulate the relationship between a data principal and data fiduciary.As per the definition of data fiduciary, it can be any person including the State, a company, or any juristic entity or any individual who alone or in conjunction with others determines the purpose and means of processing of personal data. This impliedly means that the number of data fiduciaries in the Indian cyber space will be substantially high. In order to balance between the interests of data principals as well as data fiduciaries, an independent board shall be set up to prescribe technical standards for activities defined under the definition of processing u/s 3(32).Possible SolutionAn independent board such as the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) can be set up to lay down the technical standards for various processing activities defined under Section 3(32). The power given to DPA can be limited to enforcement of these standards and suggest appropriate changes to these standards to the said board. This board shall comprise of technical as well as legal experts having domain-specific knowledge in the activities given u/s 3(32).The scope of the act given under Section 2 shall also include the data collected offline but processed or stored online.This bill is also silent on the aspect of ownership of personal data of a data principal. The bill must recognize data principal as the owner of his or her personal data.With possible technological advancements, it is possible that re-identification of a data principal is possible even after anonymisation of his data and hence, processing of anonymised data shall also be brought under the scope of this act by making changes in the definition of personal data.The definition of personal data u/s Section 2(29) does not specify whether it covers false information as well. Definition of personal data u/s 2 of Singapore PDPA, 2012 includes data about an individual whether true or not and hence, on the similar lines, the phrase whether true or not can be added to the definition in the bill.If a data principal exercises his rights given under Chapter VI, the concerned data fiduciaries shall also inform other fiduciaries with whom the data was shared.The notice framework given under Section 8 of the bill shall also include information such as –Whether data will be manually processed or automaticallyWhether the collected data will be used for profiling or notWhether the collected data will be used for direct marketing or notMajority of the debate on data protection in India is based on various reported incidents related to Aadhaar. Hence, UIDAI shall also be brought under the scope of this bill as a data fiduciary and power to enforce the provisions of the bill, as well as the remedies, shall be left to DPA and its adjudication wing.The definition of harm under Section 2(31) shall also include non-physical harms.Section 10 of the bill talks about limiting the storage limitation on the personal data of a data principal. In many cases, a data fiduciary may consider reasonably necessary duration to an extent which is highly beneficial in its favour. To prevent this, the duration for which personal data will be stored can be specifically mentioned in the notice under Section 8, subject to legal or regulatory requirements.For notification of a data fiduciary as a guardian data fiduciary, certain certification requirements must be prescribed and public opinion must be sought on this notification in order to cross-check the image of the said data fiduciary.Although the right to withdraw consent has been mentioned in the notice framework in Section 8 and Section 12(2)(e) considers a consent to be valid only if it is capable of being withdrawn, this right must be recognised as a separate right in Chapter VI so that a data principal has remedies available as per the procedure laid down by Section 28.[1] https://cyberblogindia.in/right-to-be-forgotten-surfaces-india/(Jointly authored by Raj Pagariya, Abhay Singh Sengar, Titiksha Seth, and Sahana Chaudhuri.)"

    "headline": "Proceedings of Securing Cyber Space 2018 [Event]",
    "data": "We recently attended Securing Cyber Space 2018, a conference jointly organized by Policy Perspectives Foundation (PPF) and CPF on September 07, 2018, at India International Centre, New Delhi. This post presents some interesting insights gathered by us during the conference.A total of five sessions were organized discussing various issues related to the Personal Data Protection Bill, 2018. A detailed layout of these sessions and their respective panel members are given below. All these sessions were broadcasted live on CPF’s Facebook Page. The discussion in each session was followed by a Question & Answer (Q&A) round for the attendees to ask their questions and queries to the panellists of their respective sessions.[* This session was organized behind the closed doors and it was not broadcasted live, considering the sensitive nature of issues being discussed.]\n[Name of the panellists highlighted in bold were the moderators for their respective session.]\nMr PC Haldar, Ex-director, Intelligence Bureau, from PPF delivering the welcome note for the conferenceMr PC Haldar, Ex-director, Intelligence Bureau, started the first session of the day by delivering a welcome note for all the attendees. He stressed the fact that the discussion on data protection should not be limited to the experts only, it must include the public at large.Session – 1Mr Nitish initiated the discussion by presenting certain key features of the bill and highlighting some of the shortcomings. Dr Divya Bansal talked about issues such as disadvantages of data localisation, purpose limitation of the consent given to data fiduciary, and retrospective aspect of the bill on the data which has been collected before its enactment. According to her, there shall be a separate legislation dealing with data surveillance and national security. Further, Ms Neha Chaudhary appreciated the reorganization of notice and consent framework while Mr Rahul Sharma considered that forcing the Indian companies to restrict the flow of their data will significantly affect innovation in the country.Session – 2The second session of the day was moderated by Dr S Govind. Advocate Nappinai pondered over a number of points on whether data privacy will be an active enabler for cyber security. Mr Krishnamoorthy expressed his concerns over possible catastrophic effects due to attacks if data localisation leads to storage of data in a limited geographical area. While according to Ms Smita, in order to successfully implement a data localisation policy, the government should also prescribe appropriate technical standards along with the bill. The session concluded with a thorough discussion on the implementation of technical standards throughout the corporate processes to enable and enhance cyber security in the Indian ecosystem.Special SessionThis session was going on parallel with the second session. Mr PC Haldar, the moderator of the session started the session by inviting Mr Shilohu Rao for presenting his views. He specifically made a point that the existing Indian legal regime is absolutely incompetent with the technical advancements. He also discussed how Article 32B of Budapest Convention overrides the sovereignty of a state. He concluded by giving the formula of 4 Rs for cyber security – Recognise, Redesign, Resist and Rebuild. Following him, Mr Rajan emphasised that it is the high time for us as a country to deal with the overall picture along with various theories related to national security and their relevancy in the cyber space.Mr Karnesudas took the discussion forward by presenting the applications of Artificial Intelligence to protect the nation’s critical infrastructure. He insisted that our country lacks applied researches being conducted or funded by the state organizations. Mr Satish had a similar opinion and he added that technological developments could not be avoided, the stakeholders have to find ways to enhance the overall security posture. According to him, the commercialisation of quantum computing technology also poses a significant challenge for the policymakers.Session – 3After Dr Roy, the moderator started the session for the panel members to share their views, Mr SK Bhalla asserted that data localisation is a quantum jump in personal data privacy which requires a well-structured and organized policy framework dealing with important issues such as DPIA, enforcement of liability between a data fiduciary and a data principle, data stored in legacy systems, etc. Mr Rajan, on the other hand, argued that data localisation must be considered an opportunity, not as a challenge. He referred to data as oil and reiterated that in order to enforce one’s right to privacy as a fundamental right, the data must be stored within the Indian jurisdiction.The discussion moved forwarded with Mr Nikhil contradicting data is oil statement. According to him, if data is considered as oil, then we are only looking at data from an economic perspective, not from the rights perspective. He contended that localisation is severely going to affect small and medium-sized businesses as they would not be able to afford the prices. This will lead to centralization of the internet to certain MNCs which is certainly against the sole idea of decentralization of the Internet and democratic powers of the netizens.Session – 4Since data localisation was discussed in each of the sessions held so far, Mr Naavi affirmed that compliance costs are going to be there. Earlier, there were no compliance requirements, but with developments in the country’s legal regime, compliance costs are bound to increase as well as vary. On the similar lines, Mr Bareja advanced his viewpoint that when we are talking about security, we can not use the word absolute. Absolute security is a myth, and absolute privacy may directly affect the national security. There is no harm in recognising privacy as a right, but it should be subject to certain reasonable restrictions, just like other fundamental rights.Ms Chittor insisted that an ideal law should be clear, precise, and implementable. It must be accepted in its true essence by individuals as well as the commercial entities. However, that is not true in today’s sense as people are only trying to find loopholes to exploit them. Summarizing the views of other panel members, Dr Tabrez, the moderator arrived at a conclusion that we, as individuals, still need time to understand what privacy actually is and its applications as well as implications. This view was supported by Advocate Duggal who expressed that there is no need to hurry this bill. If we are going to have a legislation, we must have a comprehensive legislation covering all the aspects with the minimum number of possible loopholes.Events and discussions like these are indeed valuable to direct the existing Indian legal regime in the right direction so that it remains on par with the technological advancements. We applaud the efforts put in by PPF and CPF in order to make this a successful event. As a team of budding cyber law and policy enthusiasts, we would definitely like to see more such events being organized by prominent stakeholders or the subject-matter experts."

    "headline": "Reserve Bank of India’s Data Localization Policy",
    "data": "We are living in the times when the Internet supports a predominant part of commerce and the online payments ecosystem has attained a new stature. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) issued a notification to mandate the storage of all end-to-end transaction data within India on April 8, 2018. RBI, the central banking institution, controlling monetary policies in India, requires unrestricted supervisory access to all the payment data and hence this mandate. Data Localization can be referred to as a government policy for storing the user data collected within its jurisdiction on the servers located within the country.Amazon, American Express, and Microsoft are the among the companies that oppose this policy and have urged the government to slacken these restrictions. If these US origin companies resist in obeying the law, it could severely hamper the trade relations between the two countries. The Statement on Development and Regulatory Policies under the head “Storage of Payment System Data” notifies that stringent security measures needed to be adopted for better monitoring of payment data.\nThe directive requires the service providers to store all the transactional data in a system situated only in India. Transactional data includes full end-to-end transaction details, information collected, carried, processed as part of the message and payment instruction. In case of any foreign leg in the transaction, the data can also be stored in the foreign nation as well.\nThe system providers shall complete compliance within 6 months and report compliance till October 15, 2018. Thereafter, the system providers are required to duly submit the System Audit Report (SAR), audited by CERT-IN emplaned auditors, before December 31, 2018.RBI’s Data Localization Policy Data Localization laws which are enforced as a security measure by a nation, pose to be a threat to various MNCs who will have to invest in infrastructure and bear further costs of compliance. These restrictions imposed by countries follow two divergent paths, first being the forced laws while the other being industry-specific laws. The forced localization requires a broad spectrum of industries to keep the data housed within the boundaries of the sovereign, for example, China, Russia, Indonesia, Kazakhstan, Nigeria and more. The industry-specific as the name suggests requires only a certain type of user data (such as medical data, financial data, telecommunications data etc.) within the sovereign, for example, Australia, Venezuela, Ukraine, Canada and more.China emphasizes on government control and protection of data, which has been reinforced in China’s Cybersecurity Law. China not only seeks to control data within its territory but also control Chinese language and media external to its borders. China has blocked many U.S based internet companies to assist local competitors to expand hence increasing China’s influence on the internet and data.Russia shares with China similar interest in cyber sovereignty. In 2015, Russia enacted the Federal Law No. 242-FZ which requires all the personal information of Russian citizens to be stored and processed on the servers located in the country. Russia enforced the data localization policy for all websites, LinkedIn, a popular international professional networking site refused to co-operate with the new regulations and hence was blocked in Russia. They also instructed Apple and Google to remove the LinkedIn application from the mobile stores. Russia had also blocked the Chinese social media app, WeChat in May 2017 because it failed to provide its contact details.In 2016, the Republic of Kazakhstan with an amendment to the Law No. 94-V on Personal Data and Protection 2013 mandated the need to store all the personal data by the owner or operator or a third party on databases located in the country.Canada does not have a federal data localization regulation but provinces such as British Columbia and Nova Scotia have laws which restrict data transfer outside the borders of the country. Personal Information International Disclosure Protection Act in Nova Scotia renders the storage of information by public bodies and municipalities outside Canada as illegal. In British Columbia, Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act directs to store and access the personal information obtained or controlled by a public body, in Canada only.Australian My Health Records Act, formerly called Personally Controlled Electronic Health Records Act prohibits the transfer of personal health data outside the country.Turkey enforced the law on Payment and Security Reconciliation Systems, Payment Services, and Electronic Money Institutions, against the payment service providers, requiring them to process all the data locally. PayPal has lost its license to do business in Turkey because it failed to comply with the policy.Data Localization: friend or foe?\nOne of the major duties of the government is to protect its citizens, which in this period clearly includes their personal information. Data localization acts as the first brick in the wall, for better surveillance and management of the data belonging to a country’s citizens.\nThe mandate of storing data locally gives the domestic companies an edge over the industry giants. Also, the companies will be persuaded to set up offices in the country, hence increasing local investment and perhaps more jobs for the residents. Data localization policy leads to capital flow into the country. \nThe downside of the data localization is economic isolation and curbed growth. The companies operating internationally, which have been doing business in the country for decades will have to modify their structure and establish a fresh data flow and processing model. The industries might also be concerned with ‘RBI’s unfettered supervisory access’ to their data. Data localization laws are often viewed as protectionist and hence seem to violate the Competition Law. The authoritarian localization of data is against the original characteristic of the internet.Conclusion\nIndia is one of the largest markets for companies in the world, and I believe our stand in protecting our data, will not affect the economy much. Countries around the globe have been adopting such policies; its high time India makes such essential changes in the existing cyber regimes to protect the data of Indian citizens."

    "headline": "Forwarding derogatory post on Facebook: S. Ve Shekar Case",
    "data": "On an average, people spend more than 135 minutes (Statista Survey) on Social Media websites by liking, commenting, sharing, retweeting and double tapping posts from people and pages. With the reach of social media exceeding the other modes of communication, it is imperative to be responsible on social media about what you are liking and sharing. If you follow a celebrity or a political person and like and share every post or tweet they have been posting on their social media, you need to be careful of what you share or retweet.A recent judgment on 10th May 2018 by Madras High Court in S. Ve Shekar highlighted how a forwarded message is equal to accepting the message and endorsing the message. That old habit of saying that you’ve just forward as you received might no longer be able to save you. Well, it might save you from the wrath of those near and dear ones but not from the adverse use of the law. The brief facts of the case are as follows:\n\nA well-known local BJP leader, Mr Shekar on 19th April 2018 shared a post on his Facebook timeline about women journalists. The shared post was – “Recently this disgusting fact has come out through complaints that women cannot become reporters or anchors unless they sleep with top bosses and with these faces they come out to ask questions to the Governors”.\n\nA well-known local BJP leader, Mr Shekar on 19th April 2018 shared a post on his Facebook timeline about women journalists. The shared post was – “Recently this disgusting fact has come out through complaints that women cannot become reporters or anchors unless they sleep with top bosses and with these faces they come out to ask questions to the Governors”. \n\nThe leader was charged with Sections 504, 505(1) (c), 509 of IPC read with Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Women Harassment Act, 1998.\n\nThe leader was charged with Sections 504, 505(1) (c), 509 of IPC read with Section 4 of the Tamil Nadu Prohibition of Women Harassment Act, 1998. \n\nMr Shekhar approached the Madras High Court for Anticipatory Bail.\n\nMr Shekhar approached the Madras High Court for Anticipatory Bail. \n\nThe important aspect, in this case, was that the petitioner Mr Shekhar used the defence that he had not read the message before sharing it and that the friend who sent him that message usually sends patriotic messages, and thus he was of bona fide intention that the message was patriotic and hence, shared it on his Facebook page.\n\nThe important aspect, in this case, was that the petitioner Mr Shekhar used the defence that he had not read the message before sharing it and that the friend who sent him that message usually sends patriotic messages, and thus he was of bona fide intention that the message was patriotic and hence, shared it on his Facebook page. \n\nThe defendant also used the plea that he was not the originator of the post and hence he has not committed the offence alleged against him.\n\nThe defendant also used the plea that he was not the originator of the post and hence he has not committed the offence alleged against him. The Madras High Court rejected the plea and said that forwarded message is equal to accepting the message and endorsing the message. Strange? Let us know in the comments!Re-tweeting and sharing a post is equal to endorsing it because if such was not the case, people would keep using it as a way of abusing and not owning up to it. In United States v Yassin, No. 16-mj-2009-DPR (W. D. Mo.) the court did not address the question of whether re-tweets can be read as endorsements or establish any general rule in this regard but it is assumed that at least in some cases, re-tweet can be considered as an endorsement. Now you know why some influencers write RTs not endorsements on their profiles?Stephen J. Barret, et al. v. Ilena Rosenthal and many other cases reaffirmed that the Communications Decency Act, 1996 (US) immunizes a user from a defamation claim arising out of her republication of statements authored by a third party. Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, 1996 (US) asserts that “No provider or user of an interactive computer service shall be treated as the publisher or speaker of any information provided by another information content provider”In the UK, The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) formed a guideline named “Social Media: Guidelines on prosecuting cases involving communications sent via social media”. These guidelines define crimes into categories. Communications which are considered grossly offensive, indecent, obscene or false fall under Category 4. Category 4 deals with Section 1 of the Malicious Communications Act, 1988 which prohibits the sending of an electronic communication which is indecent, grossly offensive, or which is false, or which the sender believes to be false if, the purpose or one of the purposes of the sender is to cause distress or anxiety to the recipient. Another important statute under this category of crimes is Section 127 of the Communications Act, 2003 which makes it an offence to send or cause to be sent through a public electronic communications network a message or other matter that is grossly offensive or of an indecent or obscene character. In Chambers v DPP [2012] EWHC 2157, the divisional court defined that tweeting anything on Twitter will come under “public electronic communications network” and if it is offensive or indecent will be a crime.While in McAlpine v Bercow EWHC 1342 (QB), a retweet sent by Alan Davies, comedian and actor, also became the subject of defamation proceedings, which was later settled with an apology and damages.In Chris Lance Cairns v Lalit Modi, [2012] EWHC 756 (QB) it was held that “With respect to the re-publication of defamatory content, Indian courts have accepted that any such re-publication will give rise to a new action for defamation. The re-publisher is required to defend the publication on the same grounds as available to the originator, i.e., by proving that the elements of defamation have not been made out. There is no defence of due diligence reporting or fair comment readily available.” The underlying basis of this principle is that the re-tweet constitutes an act of independent speech relaying information afresh, possibly to a new and different audience than of the original tweet. The re-tweeter is considered a principal actor rather than as an intermediary enabling content to be relayed to others.Canadian precedents have the same stand on the issue,  in Pritchard v. Van Nas (2016 BCSC 686), the court believed that the author of the post is himself liable for any republication of the defamatory post by any third party.The article Should the law beat a retweet? Rationalizing liability standards for sharing of digital content talks about attributing legal liability to re-tweeters. Re-tweeters have been attributed with the same liability as that of an intermediary. By the virtue of existing laws, traditional internet intermediaries (such as Facebook and Twitter) cannot be held responsible for all the content that is posted on their publicly viewable and searchable platform. They act as passive conduits, carrying and hosting user-generated content that they do not control. Users do not share the same immunity. Twitter, in fact, gives users a notice that they not only own but are responsible for the content they post.Zurich District Court in a case charged a man for liking a defamatory comment on Facebook. The court held that by liking defamatory statements which included content contrary to the interests of the animal rights activist Erwin Kessler and his animal rights group, the accused had adopted those statements as his own and had disseminated them making it accessible to a multitude of people.ConclusionFreedom of speech guaranteed under article 19(a) of the Constitution of India has a few safeguards which include speaking against public order, decency or morality and defamation. We have entered the era of the internet where “Actions DON’T speak louder than words”.We need to be very careful of what we write on the internet or even for that matter share on the internet. It is not just our own freedom of speech but empathy about others that also needs to come into the picture. A general view of other nations seems to coincide with the Madras HC decision of amounting a forwarded derogatory post with liability similar to the originator. While this case is not just limited to the forwarded message but also to the person who forwarded the message.A celebrity-like person is at an influential position with social responsibility and when such a person shares a particular message on the internet, common people tend to easily believe that the said culture is prevalent in the society.Co-authored by Abhay Singh Sengar and Titiksha Seth"

    "headline": "Are WhatsApp Group Admins liable for fake news?",
    "data": "Recently, WhatsApp has been the centre of attraction of many debates in India. Some calling action from the communication platform and some seeking assistance and accountability. While the pressing reason for this remains the incidents of mob lynching and the spread of hateful/fake/inciteful images, videos, news etc. over chats, new developments are only giving birth to newer challenges for both the state and the citizens. There are many issues that surround this bigger conundrum of WhatsApp, Intermediary liability and responsibility, free speech and freedom on the Internet. Somewhere along the cracks, there is another issue of Internet shutdowns picking up the pace. This post, however, is limited to analysing the liability of WhatsApp group admins for fake news, obscene content etc. that spreads via members on the group. Recently, after an MHA notice to the chat platform, WhatsApp has replied stating that they are rolling out newer updates like increased control of an admin over who can message in a group and the forward label. While the excessive power being vested in the group admin does seem like an affirmation of the accountability that an admin must have, the legal standpoint is unclear. There have been many reports and attempts in the past about making group admins responsible and accountable, like the one in Varanasi and Kishtwar recently. Not looking at the social aspect of it, the position in law has to be dealt with in order to better understand how the law translates and adapts to a situation like this. Though such liability should be general and not specific to WhatsApp, it seems that with the recent and ongoing updates, the situation might change. It does seem logical mostly to relate traditional spaces with online ones to understand the application of law. In this case, one has to look at the publication of a newspaper conventionally in order to understand liability fixing when there is no provision in law for the cyberspace in India. While there is no general liability upon the owner of a newspaper (no criminal whatsoever) for content being published in a newspaper, it is also not absolute. When it can be proved beyond doubt that the owner had some involvement in the motivation for such publication which is either inciteful to an offence or defamatory even, he can be held liable. It is debatable, however, whether a group admin is actually an owner in this sense because he does not control the content that is published in the group. Even if it is only other admins that have rights to post in the group, each of them would be liable for their own postings if the others had no role to play or conversely the culprit would have to prove that the others had involvement and sufficient participation. The takeaway from this discussion as is also reflected in K.K. Mathew vs K.A. Abraham is that even a group admin can be liable (if he’s thought to be the owner/content editor and if he has sufficient involvement, intention etc. for the publication). The admins in this context have no fixed liability but no absolution from it as well. It is like that sword which has both the edges. There is no clear provision in the Indian law or a case that sets precedent in this matter. What is vaguely used by many experts and commentators is the 2016 Delhi High Court Judgement in the case of Ashish Bhalla vs Suresh Chowdhary & Ors. One paragraph in the judgement which read as under picked up good media attention: “I am unable to understand as to how the administrator of a group can be held liable for defamation, even if any, by the statements made by a member of the group. To make an administrator of an online platform liable for defamation would be like making the manufacturer of the newsprint on which defamatory statements are published liable for defamation”When looked at closely, this case was about an almost civil matter that was through defamation connected to this understanding. In my legal understanding, this law point actually does not have much weight because today admins do have greater control over content in groups and we are not just looking at defamation. The issues and challenges on the ground have become more serious. This is an interesting question and one to which I found various supporting comments during my research. The strict answer to such a question in my understanding would be ‘No’. Calling a group admin an intermediary is defiant of Section 2(w) of the IT Act, 2000 and principles of basic logic. If one were to absolutely think of online spaces as restricted modes of communication with a group admin doing the actual job of receiving and sending the communication, perhaps then this wild assumption may be right. The legislators’ opinion and intent in drafting Section 2(w) of the IT Act are clear from the text itself- there is a degree of control or at least technology enablement at their end which makes them intermediaries for facilitation in the true sense.Just for the sake of academic debates, if we were to consider admins as intermediaries, even then their criminal liability for content in their groups does not arise. It is a settled matter through Shreya Singhal vs Union of India and a few precedents that follow that an intermediary has to be apprised of content to be removed through court orders. In any which way, which the admin cannot do. As per the law, an intermediary is supposed to remove content reported to them within 36 hours of such knowledge but technologically, it is not possible to be done on a group by an admin which again absolves him of this blanket definition of intermediary.But my legal viewpoint does not favour the admin in the end. Whether an admin can be liable or not for criminal activities such as complaints arising out of Section 153A of the IPC has to be a contextual and very case specific observation. Arrests can definitely be made under the provision now that the law and order situation is such that the primary objective is to protect innocent lives. What happens to these arguments of liability in court is a matter yet to be seen.One thing, however, is clear in my opinion: An admin is not liable prima facie but if it can be proved that he had the intention/motivation/involvement in such publications in a group that led to defamation/promotion of ill will, hatred etc. among communities, then he is liable for criminal action. Even the language of Section 153A requires the accused to be promoting enmity through any means. But we should still keep this in mind that incidents of mob lynching targeted at particular individuals still do not fall under Section 153A of the IPC which is very specific for enmity between groups, communities not against an individual. "

    "headline": "Banking Ombudsman – Things You Should Know",
    "data": "Banking Ombudsman is a quasi-judicial body established under the Banking Regulation Act, 1949 by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to redress the grievances of the customers regarding certain banking services. Currently, the Banking Ombudsman Scheme 2006 is in force.The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which had been providing relief to the consumers, was flooded with complaints regarding services provided by the bank. These complaints had to be sent to the respective banks and they were asked to submit a response for the same. The banking sector was constantly under criticism, as to whether these complaints have been redressed or not.To put an end to RBI’s sustained anxiety towards the improvement of customer services in banks, the ‘Narasimhan’ Committee on “Banking and Financial Sector Reforms” examined these critical areas and recommended the introduction of the “Banking Ombudsman Scheme 1995” as a part of Financial Sector Policy and Systems Reforms 1991-92 to 1995-96. This proposed scheme finally took shape during the next decade and came into effect in 2006.On the basis of an RTI response received by us, primarily a grievance against a specific bank needs to be lodged with the concerned bank branch. If the customer is not satisfied with the reply or resolution, a complaint can be lodged with the Nodal Officers/Principle Nodal Officers at Controlling Office/Head Office of the bank branch, appointed under the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, 2006. If the complaint is not redressed within a month by the Nodal Officer, the office of the Banking Ombudsman can be approached. The complaint to the Banking Ombudsman under whose jurisdiction the bank branch is situated can be submitted by a handwritten application or online here or through Email.All Scheduled Commercial Banks, Regional Rural Banks and Scheduled Primary Co-operative Banks are covered under the Scheme. Non-scheduled banks which are not listed in the Second Schedule of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 do not comply with the provisions of the RBI Act and hence, cannot be covered the ambit of the Banking Ombudsman Scheme.The Banking Ombudsman shall exercise the duty of a conciliator, mediator or arbitrator for the settlement of the complaint and pass an award to the satisfaction of the aggrieved.A bank not agreeing to accept the award given by the Banking Ombudsman can file a review with the reviewing authority within one month from the date of receipt of the award.As asserted by Clause 8 of the Banking Ombudsman Scheme 2006, a complaint can be lodged for any deficiency in banking services or for any violation of the RBI directives such as:Non-payment or irrational delay in the payment or collection of cheques, drafts, bills etc. and payment of inward remittances.Non-acceptance, without sufficient cause, of small denomination notes and coins tendered for any purpose, and for charging of commission in respect thereof.Failure to issue/provide or delay in issue/providing of any banking facility promised by the bank or its direct selling agent in writing such as drafts, pay orders or bankers’ cheques.Non-adherence to the prescribed working hours or provisions of the Code of Bank’s Commitments to Customers issued by BCSBI and as adopted by the bank or any RBI guideline/instructions/directives.Refusal to open deposit accounts, for any valid reason or levying charges without prior notice or refusal to close or delay in closing the accounts or forced closure of accounts without sufficient notice.Complaints from Non-Resident Indians having accounts in India in relation to their remittances from abroad, deposits and other bank-related matters.Non-disbursement or delay in disbursement of pension.Refusal to accept or delay in accepting payment towards taxes, as required by Reserve Bank/Government or redemption of any other Government securities.Non- acceptance or delay in sanction, disbursement or non-observance of prescribed time schedule of loan applications.When can a complaint be rejected?A complaint can be rejected on the ground that the complainant has not approached the bank first or one year has passed from the day of receipt of the reply from the bank or the complaint is pending for disposal at any other forum or any such reason.  The complaint can also be rejected if it seems to be frivolous or if the subject matter is not mentioned in Clause 8 of the scheme. More details can be found here.Unlike the Banking Ombudsman Scheme, the Code of Bank’s Commitment to Customers’ by Banking Codes and Standards Board of India (BCSBI) is a set of banking best practices by the banks. It does not replace or supersede the guidelines issued by the RBI but complements them. A list of DOs and DON’Ts have also been added to the code to aware consumers regarding the security measures to be taken care of while opting for digital transactions. The code promotes ‘limited liability’ concept for unauthorized electronic transactions.As per the RBI guidelines dated July 06, 2017,  a bank is liable to credit the amount lost by a customer via shadow reversal within ten days in cases of ATM frauds involving cloning of a customer’s debit/credit card. This liability is absolute if the customer reports unauthorised transactions within three days of being informed by the bank. The concerned bank has to carry out an internal investigation to establish the identity of the person who has withdrawn using the cloned debit cards. Once it is proved in the internal investigation that the withdrawals have not been carried out by the applicant, the amount thus credited via shadow reversal shall be cleared. (Amount credited via shadow reversal is shown as uncleared balance)When a bank rejects this application or does not respond within 30 days, the customer has to approach the Nodal Officer of the concerned bank. When this application is either rejected by the nodal officer or there is no response from his office within 30 days, the recourse available with the customer is to approach the Ombudsman appointed by the RBI. The Ombudsman analyses the facts of the case and passed an appropriate order. An appeal against the order passes by the Ombudsman can also be filed by the customer.In case you have been a victim of an ATM Card Fraud, the posts given below will definitely help you.

    "headline": "How to have safe transactions at an ATM?",
    "data": "Having Safe Transactions in ATMThe advancement of technology, ease of banking and processes ranging from checking balance to transferring funds happening at the touch of a screen have driven people to go online. According to Reserve Bank of India, more than 90 percent of all reported transactions at banks between 2016 and 2017 were through the Internet in terms of volume. In 2015-16, this figure stood around 75 percent.\nWhile enjoying this newly-acquired convenience, it is important to remember that security is something which cannot be easily ignored. As per our report published in December 2017, there has been an increase of close to  500% in the number of frauds through ATMs in the last six months. To ensure that your money and personal information are safe during a transaction at an ATM, here are a few things that you should take care of:-Ensure that you are the only person inside an ATM.To avoid being a victim of shoulder surfing, always ensure that you are the only person inside an ATM while carrying out a transaction. You can even ask the guard to stand out while you are carrying out the transaction.Watch out for skimmers!An average ATM fraud results in a loss of ₹ 42,000 to the victim. An ATM Skimmer is a small device which is stuck on the ATM machine. It is very hard to recognize it in a single glance. While you are carrying out the transaction, observe closely and carefully. Watch out for any loose or ill-fitting parts on the card reader or PIN pad – also check whether there is an extra layer on the keyboard and look for parts that vary slightly in colour or that look like they were installed recently.Never forget your ATM receiptGenerally, after completing any transaction, the tendency is to crumble the atm slip and dispose of it in the wastepaper bin. People hardly ever think of putting it back in the pocket and carrying it home. With the help of details available on an ATM receipt, you can easily become a victim of social engineering. (Those calls that tell you your bank account details and then ask for other information)Pressing the CANCEL ButtonPressing the cancel button in case of a failed transaction or a frozen screen before leaving the ATM is a crucial step as it halts your transaction. There have been instances where these cancel buttons have been glued down or stuck to the machine in a way that they don’t actually get pressed. As a thumb rule, always ensure that when you walk out of an ATM, the welcome screen has returned on the machine.There have been some recent developments where the Reserve Bank of India is planning to introduce two-factor authentication for all ATM-cum-debit card transactions to ensure that the customers do not fall prey to ATM Cloning. Doing so will put more responsibility on the consumers compared to the current situations where the bank is held liable when neither the bank nor the customer is at fault (as per RBI Guidelines dated July 06, 2017).Besides all rules and regulations, you must trust your instincts while using ATMs and carry out the transactions only when you feel safe and comfortable becauseIt’s better to be safe than sorry.In case you have been a victim of an ATM Card fraud, read the posts given below to know the recovery process for the amount lost.

    "headline": "Why should you be avoiding cheap smartphone?",
    "data": "Across the world and most prominently in India, who doesn’t like that great deal that they get on a new smartphone? For as low as INR 1500 or $20 you can purchase a cheap smartphone right off the shelf of a phoney shop just about anywhere. There’s a whole rationale behind this how smartphone components are very cheap and sensors are easily available so smartphone prices should be less naturally. It is not the case, however. Quite a few educated and aware users and mostly the digital illiterate or the ones transitioning end up buying a cheap smartphone with functionalities or hardware that’s top notch. Nothing wrong there, right? It’s just a very sweet deal. Avast recently unearthed 141 different models that come rigged with malware before devices reach the market. Yes, that’s right. It is not the first time that a discovery like this has happened. On many occasions, such has been the case that cheap smartphone makers were caught shipping malware to users. This becomes relevant in today’s scenario because of the growing pace of digitization and internet penetration in India. We are a big market for smartphone makers and any intruder looking to compromise our lives. Most ignorant people will say that they have no problem with malware or that they would just factory reset to be fine. The applications that have been found to be infected have at some occasions been found to be easily removable but at many were critical system applications that in no manner could be possibly removed: meaning a continuous breach of privacy and security. On this occasion, Avast has reported two different types of malicious activities, both capable of being persistent on a smartphone and compromising user details and activities. Some apps were standalone malware but some even persistent to the level of downloading random malicious apps from time to time, making it highly difficult for the end user to catch up.  No, not all devices are affected. There are some ways to find out if you are (read more here). Having said and gone through that, it is pertinent to make amends to one’s digital lifestyle and only purchase devices, hardware and applications from trusted and verified vendors. That’s all for one of the most basic issues about your smartphone. "

    "headline": "Is Hosting a Porn Website Legal in India?",
    "data": "Out of hundreds of questions that are asked to us via our Facebook Page, E-Mails,  Helpline and Website on a daily basis, the question whether hosting a porn website is legal in India has been one of the most asked questions lately. While some questions sway towards offering services to pornographic websites and uploading content, the law certainly stays the same. We have extensively discussed the subject of pornography and related issues in the following posts –Pornography Rules in IndiaPornography and the Indian LawIs it Legal to Share Nude Pictures over WhatsApp?Indian Court Sets a Precedent in a Revenge Porn CaseFor the purpose of this question, Section 67, 67A, and 67B of the Information Act, 2000 (herein referred as the IT Act) along with Section 292 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (herein referred as IPC) are relevant. Section 67, 67A, and 67B prohibit publication and transmission of obscene content, sexually explicit content, and child pornography respectively.Section 292 talks about a representation, a figure, or any other object which can be deemed to be obscene. It states that participating in selling, publication, public exhibition, advertisement, or any such activity related to obscene content is an offence. It prescribes an imprisonment up to two years or fine up to ₹4000 or both on the first conviction while up to 5 years and ₹5000 on the second conviction.The judgement of Supreme Court in Aveek Sarkar & Anr vs State of West Bengal & Anr (2014) changed how the Indian legal system will deal with questions related to obscenity. The law views these matters aligned with the way they are obscene. Now, over the years there were different legal tests as to whether something is obscene or not but this case has brought about a pleasant change to protect non-offenders in situations where they are wrongly held. The bench of Justice KS Radhakrishnan and Justice AK Sikri struck down the age-old Hicklin test (Given by the Queen’s Bench in Regina vs Hicklin (1868)) and adopted what they called as Community Standards Test. According to this, obscenity will be measured on the current community standards in the society and the judicial system has been vested with the interpretation.  If the above-mentioned legal provisions are to be interpreted cohesively on the lines of Aveek Sarkar case, hosting a website displaying pornographic content would definitely invite the applicability of Section 292 of IPC. Moreover, Section 67, 67A, and 67B will be applicable as per the type of content involved as the IT Act is a law specialis i.e. law governing a specific subject matter. The doctrine of lex specialis derogat legi generali (A special law prevails over general and prior laws) has been upheld by the Supreme Court in the case of Anvar vs Basheer (2014) and same has been stated by the apex court in Sharat Babu Digumarti vs Government of NCT of Delhi (2016). Hence, hosting a porn website is not legal in India.On the similar lines, hosting a website containing sex stories or cartoons depicting sexually explicit content will be considered as an offence under the Indian law as well. "

    "headline": "Comments on Draft Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act (DISHA)",
    "data": "Undoubtedly, India is one country which is in the dire need for a data protection framework.  With the Committee of Experts chaired by Justice BN Srikrishna publishing the White Paper on Data Protection Framework for India (herein referred as the White Paper) in December 2017, the wheels have been indeed set in motion. And with the introduction of the draft bill of DISHA, we are surely headed in the right direction.On March 21, 2018, e-Health Section of Ministry of Health & Family Welfare, Government of India published a draft bill on Digital Information Security in Healthcare Act and has invited the general public as well as the stakeholders to send their comments by April 21, 2018. We have summarized our comments in the bullet-points given below. (Later on, we will also be publishing a white paper discussing DISHA in detail).Related to the notion of identifiability, the White Paper has discussed pseudonymisation and anonymisation in Chapter 3 of Part II. DISHA, on the other hand, discusses anonymisation and de-dentification under sub-section (a) and (d) of Section 3 respectively. Considering that the concepts of pseudonymisation and de-identification are same, the definition of pseudonymisation can be included in Section 3(d) in place of de-identification to bring the coherency with the proposed data protection framework.In Chapter 1 of Part III of the White Paper, failure of consent has been discussed. Although DISHA has included the concept of proxy consent, there is no specific provision dealing with the failure to secure consent.As defined in Section(1)(j) of DISHA, the definition of an owner includes an individual whose data has been generated and processed under this act. To bring this definition at par with EU-GDPR and the White Paper, the scope of definition can be expanded by using the words stored and transmitted or as may be deemed fit. As per our observation, the existing proposition is not sufficient.As defined in Section 3(1)(m) of DISHA, the definition of a relative gives priority to an owner’s siblings or owner’s spouse’s siblings before the owner’s children. An additional sub-clause can be added after/before Section 3(1)(m)(ii): Parents of the owner so that the children of an owner get a higher priority.The scope of the definition of data security given under Section 3(1)(n) of DISHA can be further extended by adding following words after “information in confidence” – “along with preventing unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction.”Article 13 of EU-GDPR prescribes the information to be provided when personal data of an individual is collected. Same has been given under Section 30(2) of DISHA as it lays down the procedure for collecting the digital health data of an owner. However, Article 13 makes it mandatory to provide the information about the supervisory authority and the period for which the personal data of a data subject will be stored. One the similar lines, two sub-clauses under Section 30(2) can be added for providing information about the concerned State eHealth Authority (SeHA) and the period for which the digital health data of an owner will be stored.An additional duty can be prescribed for the clinical establishments collecting the digital health data of minors. It shall be the duty of clinical establishments to verify that the consent of a minor has been lawfully provided by his guardian.Section 38(3) classifies repeated data breaches by a clinical establishment or a health information exchange as a serious breach. However, there is no provision under either Section 37 or Section 38 dealing with a single incident of a data breach by a clinical establishment or a health information exchange. As per our suggestion, Section 37 should penalise entities and other healthcare establishments as in Section 38 for an incident of a normal breach as well.Section 41 of DISHA only talks about the situation when one obtains the digital health data of an owner when he is not authorized to under the provisions of DISHA. In addition, the act of sharing information with a person or a party not authorized under the provisions of DISHA should also be criminalized. Although it might be a logical deduction, it would make more legal sense to explicitly mention the aforesaid."

    "headline": "The Cyber Blog India’s take on the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica Incident",
    "data": "As Indians, it has been a trend among us that we incautiously share our data to all the apps and websites that ask for it. Call it the need for free access to apps, services, games and whatnot. We do not realise that there is some catch here; for there is no free lunch which is why we are often puzzled as to how the websites providing their services for free, earn.  It is with the help of the data about us (anonymized and pseudonymized) that most of these free upon registration internet companies make their financials skyrocket. It is a common sight, you might have seen those posts with random love calculations, quizzes about your death, predictions about the date of your death and so on. If we look closely, at the time of getting these applications to work, we share a lot of data with developers of such applications. Focusing on spreading their roots, Facebook is being blamed for compromising personal data of more than 87 million users.It all began in 2007 when Facebook created a platform for people to log in to apps using Facebook and share their data. In 2013, Kogan, a researcher at Cambridge University, created an app and accessed data of around 300,000 users. In the following year, Facebook restricted the data accessed by apps unless the user had authorized it. It was revealed in 2015 that Kogan had shared the data with Cambridge Analytica without users’ permission. Consequently, Facebook asked Cambridge Analytica to delete the data and certify the same. Cambridge Analytica certified that they have deleted the data but apparently they had not. Facebook is currently facing exodus due to the breach of trust with the users. (The entire incident can be read in detail here)Facebook is brushing the dust off its shoulders claiming that it has not violated the consent decree, mishandling of data is due to the abuse of policies and procedures by Kogan and Cambridge Analytica. A consent decree is gaining users’ express consent before sharing their personal data beyond the privacy settings. Facebook users willingly allowed Kogan’s app to access their data and the app further passed on the acquired data to Cambridge Analytica. After all the blame game, Facebook CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, has taken the responsibility and apologized for the breach of trust between Facebook and its users. He has also asserted that Facebook will take appropriate steps to address the issue. The damage is already done, and Facebook’s infamy has led to the #deletefacebook movement which is being supported by some very well-known names such as Brian Acton and Elon Musk.On March 21, 2018, Mr Ravi Shankar Prasad (Union Minister for Law & Justice as well as Electronics & IT) stated in a press conference that the Central Government supports the idea of free speech and social media platforms, however, any such undesirable activity done to influence the electoral process would be not tolerated. He went on to clarify that if data theft of Indian citizens is done via collusion of Facebook systems, the Government will use appropriate powers under the IT Act to summon Mark Zuckerberg to India. Whether the Information Technology Act, 2000 is strong enough to do so is a question of some other time. Simultaneously, the Central Government sending notices to Facebook & Cambridge Analytica is definitely appreciable. The notice sent to Facebook specifically asks questions such as preventive measures implemented, types of data harvested, etc.Facebook, along with WhatsApp, have cohesively blended into our lives. For an average internet user in India, using Facebook and WhatsApp has become an everyday chore. Considering that India accounts for more than 10% of Facebook users worldwide, this is one market which cannot be disappointed. Even though the understanding, awareness and jurisprudence on privacy are in the nascent stages in India, we do have the Governments, activists, and organizations taking a proactive approach by discussing these issues.With a prospective user base as large as 135 crores, gone are the times when privacy was labelled as an after-development activity or it was completely ignored. We believe that it is the right time for the companies and developers to implement the concept of privacy by design. Considering that the data is the next big thing and quoting Uncle Ben from Spider-Man, With great power comes great responsibility.We hope that not only Facebook but all organizations dealing with the user data understands this, sooner or later.(Co-authored by Titiksha Seth & Raj Pagariya)"

    "headline": "Indian Court Sets Precedent in a Revenge Porn Case",
    "data": "According to National Crime Records Bureau, there has been an increment of 157% in the number of cases reported for sharing of obscene content on the Internet since 2012.Women have always been the object of crime in India but now the crimes against women are increasing even in the virtual world. Sadly, the legal framework is not adequate yet to protect women from such crimes. Revenge Porn is one of such serious cyber-crimes against women. Though it is relatively new in India and its rise cannot be denied. It involves sharing of sexually explicit (read private or nude) pictures of a person without consent. It is done basically by ex-lovers or former partners to gain revenge and cause shame & intimidation to the victim.Moreover, we don’t have any direct law against revenge porn. So, whenever such crimes take place, they are dealt under the provisions of the Information Technology Act, 2000 (Sections 66E, 67, and 67A) read with the provisions of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (Sections 354A, 354C, 354D, 509).The most recent conviction has been in the case of “State of West Bengal v Animesh Boxi” where the facts of the case are as follows.The victim had been in a relationship with the defendant for 3 years.During the course of this time, the defendant had asked for private and nude pictures from the victim.The victim, being emotional, had sent the private (read objectionable) pictures but denied giving the nude pictures.The defendant copied her nude pictures from her phone and started blackmailing the victim to go on an outing with him. Else, he would upload the pictures and videos on the Internet.The victim disagreed and hence the accused uploaded the pictures and videos on porn sites.Handling a cybercrime case is not easy as it becomes very difficult to gather the electronic evidence, making it admissible and proving the accused guilty. In this particular case, there was a submission of more than 200 documents and citation of 300 judgements globally. Mr Gautam Kumar Nag, Third Judicial Magistrate First Class, Tamluk, District Purba Medinipur pronounced the judgement in the victim’s favour convicting the accused with an imprisonment of 5 years and a fine of around ₹9000/-.Adv. Bivas ChatterjeeRevenge Porn is a global phenomenon but unfortunately, only 2% of the crime is actually reported in India. He also stated that sixty-seventy percent of the virtual data is pornographic content. With the ever-increasing demand for such videos, we need to understand that in India circulation of content that threatens the modesty of a woman is a punishable offence. He encourages everyone to raise an alarm, lodge a complaint if they come across revenge porn or rape videos. Any responsible citizen can lodge a complaint, even journalist while doing any investigative stories related to revenge porn or rape videos can approach the judiciary. Such kind of step will definitely make a man with such intentions think twice before resorting to revenge porn.In this particular case, the judgement was pronounced within six months and it is first such case of conviction by the state for cybercrime against women. It is a progressive step that Indian judiciary has started dealing with such cases efficiently and also focusing on its speedy disposal. Apart from this, let it be any person, male or female, need to act maturely. Everyone should be careful about what they are clicking and sharing while in a relationship including marriage."

    "headline": "Is UIDAI a ‘body corporate?’",
    "data": "The Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI) is a statutory authority established under the Aadhaar (Targeted Delivery of Financial and Other Subsidies, Benefits and Services) Act, 2016 (“Aadhaar Act, 2016”). It earlier functioned as an attached office of the Planning Commission (now known as NITI Aayog).The Aadhaar Act, 2016 with Section 11(2) clearly establishes UIDAI as a body corporate and Section 30 of the same act qualifies the biometric information collected and stored by UIDAI to be “electronic record” and “sensitive personal data or information” as per the Information Technology Act, 2000 and subsequent rules. Hence, it reflects that the biometrics collected under the Aadhaar Act will be subject to the IT Act, 2000 and the subsequent rules.The Information Technology Act, 2000 under Section 43A renders that a body corporate is defined as “any company and includes a firm, sole proprietorship or other association of individuals engaged in commercial or professional activities” would be held responsible under this provision as well as the rules to ensure security of data and information of an individual and could be held liable for being negligent in implementing reasonable security practices and procedures.As per the definition of body corporate given by the IT Act, UIDAI is not a body corporate as it does not indulge in commercial or professional activities. (Although commercial and professional activities have not been explicitly defined in the IT Act, 2000).The Consumer Protection Act, 1986 defines commercial purpose as not a one in which a person uses goods or services by himself for the purpose of earning his livelihood by self-employment. For professional activity, it was held in Surti v. State of Gujarat (AIR 1969 SC 63) that “a professional activity must be an activity carried on by an individual by his personal skill and intelligence.” Amidst all this ambiguity, the Companies Act, 2013 provides for a separate definition for body corporates. The General Clauses Act, 1897  is silent in this regard.We do not have a uniform definition for body corporates, each act defines it with its limited view, which causes incompatibility of such acts and many organizations have been and will take advantage of this fact.Since very clearly, UIDAI cannot undisputedly be classified as a body corporate, it can dodge its liability under the IT Act and the subsequent rules. What remains to be seen is whether this question will be addressed in the on-going hearing of the Aadhaar case under the Apex court.If UIDAI is covered under the IT Act and the subsequent rules, it will have to comply with numerous security practices and procedures for the safety of sensitive personal information of the citizens, which includes international standard IS/ISO/IEC 27001 on “Information Technology – Security Techniques – Information Security Management System – Requirements” or any policy for data protection duly approved by the Central Government and Audit of the security practices and procedures carried out at least once a year.  As per the RTI reply to us, ISMS policies and audits are being duly conducted by UIDAI.Both the RTI Act and the Aadhaar Act, limit the sharing/disclosure of the personal information of any individual. The RTI Act with Section 8(j) restricts the disclosure of the personal information of any individual, except when such information is related to any public activity or interest. Section 8 of the Aadhaar Act prevents sharing of any personal information of any individual to any entity for authentication without the permission of the individual and sharing of any core biometric information is not permitted.The above discussion leads us to the assumption that in case there is a breach, audit logs and ISMS policies of UIDAI may be called into question and in fact, the affected citizen(s) can also file a civil litigation with the Adjudicating Officer to receive compensation under Section 43A of the Information Technology Act, 2000."

    "data": "(नोट: इस पोस्ट को हिन्दी मे पढ़ने के लिए नीचे जाये)Today is February 06, 2018. You might see a few tweets and Facebook posts here and there about this. Safer Internet Day was started off in 2004 in the UK which is now celebrated in more than 130 countries. People are doing their bit to make the Internet a better place on this day, are you?Security is an ongoing process but given the fact that there is a lack of awareness and common sense in most of the cases, security is still a far-fetched concept. I will take an example of a bank. You can not protect its infrastructure from breaches ifThe password to access technologically-advanced (read state-of-the-art) security systems is admin@123.You have locked every door but left keys at the main door,Your Security Guards are sleeping and they do not have any weapons, and so on.This list can go on and on. Right from the start, we have believed that awareness plays a vital role in an individual’s security, privacy, safety, and all such similar words.So, here are a few points for you to go through to make sure that you are not digging your own grave –You shall never set your passwords as names/birthdays/phone numbers of your family members and friends. Try including special characters such as @,#,$,%, etc and numbers in your passwords so that you are not prone to shoulder surfing and dictionary attacks.Keep different passwords for different accounts. It will take a bit of an effort at your end but it is your online presence, after all.Oversharing might not always be the right choice. Sharing your live location, for example, when you are travelling with your family may lead to inviting thieves to your home.Every social media platform has privacy settings. Before going all guns blaze, make sure to at least read through them once.There is no free lunch. Your bank, government departments, some charity in South Africa or some will-executor will never call you to give ₹ 10 lakh or even more.When you are doing online transactions via internet banking, always check the URL. And if you are doing mobile banking, always download the legitimate applications from the app store.If you need any help, feel free to contact us via email at contact@cyberblogindia.in or drop a message on our Facebook page.आज 6 फ़रवरी 2018 है | हो सकता है की आज आपने कुछ फ़ेसबूक पोस्ट्स ओर ट्वीट्स सेफ़र इंटरनेट डे के बारे मे देखी हो | सेफ़र इंटरनेट डे की शुरुआत 2004 मे यूनाइटेड किंगडम मे हुई थी पर अब ये दिन 130 से भी ज्यादा देशों मे मनाया जाता है | लोग इस दिन इंटरनेट को एक बेहतर जगह बनाने के लिए अपने प्रयास कर रहे है, क्या आप भी कर रहे है ?सुरक्षा एक निरंतर चलने वाली प्रक्रिया है लेकिन अगर ये तथ्य देखा जाये की अधिकांश साइबर अपराधों की जड़ जागरूकता और सामान्य ज्ञान की कमी ही है, सुरक्षा अभी भी एक दूर की अवधारणा है | मैं एक बैंक का उदाहरण लेता हूँ | आप एक बैंक को हैक होने से या चोरी होने से नहीं बचा सकते अगर –बैंक मे लगी हुई तकनीकी रूप से उन्नत सुरक्षा प्रणालियों का पासवर्ड admin@123 रख देते है ,आपने हर दरवाज़े पर ताला तो लगा दिया है पर आपने चाबियाँ बाहर ही छोड़ दी है,आपके सेक्युर्टी गार्ड्स सो रहे है और उनके पास किसी भी तरह के हथियार नहीं है, आदि|इस लिस्ट मे ऐसे काफी उदाहरण दिये जा सकते है | शुरू से ही हम मानते है की जागरूकता किसी भी व्यक्ति की ऑनलाइन सुरक्षा, गोपनीयता, और ऐसे सारे समान शब्दों मे एक महत्वपूर्ण भूमिका निभाती है |इसी कड़ी मे नीचे कुछ टिप्स दिये गए है जिससे आप सुनिश्चित करे की आप ऑनलाइन दुनिया मे कहीं अपनी खुद की ही कब्र तो नहीं खोद रहे है –कभी भी अपने परिवार के सदस्यों और दोस्तो के नाम/जन्मदिन/फोन नंबर को अपने पासवर्ड के रूप मे नहीं सेट करे | आप अपने पासवर्ड मे स्पेशल कैरेक्टर जैसे की #,@,!,$,% और अंकों का इस्तेमाल करे जिससे आप शोल्डर सर्फिंग, डिक्शनरी अटैक, आदि से बच सके|अपने हर अकाउंट के लिए अलग अलग पासवर्ड रखे | आपको थोड़ा सा प्रयास करना पड़ेगा पर ये आपकी ही ऑनलाइन सुरक्षा की बात है |जरूरत से ज्यादा जानकारी सोशल मीडिया पर शेयर करना हमेशा सही नहीं होता है | उदाहरण के तौर पर अगर आप अपने परिवार वालों के साथ कहीं बाहर है और अपनी लाइव लोकेशन साझा करते है, तो आप खुद ही चौरों को आपके घर आने का निमंत्रण दे रहे है |हर सोशल मीडिया प्लैटफ़ार्म पर प्राइवसी सेटिंग्स होते है | अपनी कोई भी जानकारी शेयर करने से पहले कम से कम एक बार तो उन्हे देखे |दुनिया मे कोई भी चीज़ मुफ्त मे नहीं मिलती | आपकी बैंक, कोई भी सरकारी डिपार्टमेंट, दक्षिण अफ्रीका मे कोई चैरिटी, या फिर कोई विल-एक्सेक्युटर आपको ₹ 10 लाख या और भी ज्यादा राशि देने के लिए कॉल नहीं करेगा |इंटरनेट बैंकिंग के द्वारा कोई भी लेन-देन करने के पहले URL जाँच ले | अगर आप मोबाइल बैंकिंग कर रहे है तो सुनिश्चित करे की आपने सही एप्प डाउनलौड़ करी है |अगर आप को किसी भी तरह की मदद चाहिए तो बेझिझक हमे contact@cyberblogindia.in पर ईमेल करे या फिर हमारे फ़ेसबूक पेज़ पर मैसेज करे | "

    "headline": "ATM Fraud- 5 things a victim should do!",
    "data": "Search analysis reveals that the number of people searching for ATM Fraud is the highest in India all across the globe. Even our Electronic Banking Frauds in India report suggests how the humongous growth in ATM frauds have led to disruption in the banking sector which no agency is proactively addressing. Age old modus operandi and tactics are now being used in India to defraud innocent and cyber-unaware citizens of the country. ATM Fraud – What should you do?As a group of self-driven cyber-activists, we have helped thousands of victims till date and also been able to secure relief for many of them. This post is a follow up of our earlier post on Money Fraudulently Withdrawn and goes into the things that you must do as a victim of an ATM Fraud. Please note that this post is not legal advice and hence should not be construed in the same sense. Without clogging your screens any more, here is the list of 5 things that you should do:Block your card: As basic as this may sound, many users do not block their cards right away when they lose money in an ATM fraud. Please be advised that most of these fraudulent withdrawals happen at odd hours in the night when you are asleep and unavailable to check your messages. One proactive step that you could take is to use cards that offer a facility for switching your card on/off for transactions. Collect data about all fraud transactions: Add up all the money that has been withdrawn from the transaction reference numbers and locations of ATMs and keep this as documented information. You may find this info on your net banking/m-banking account if you have them activated. In all other cases, you will need to obtain this from the bank through a passbook update/account statement. Report to your bank: Yes, you must report to your bank before reporting to the police. Now, many banks have a dedicated dispute form for reporting cases. However, in practice, we have observed that an application worded to suit legal requirements of reporting serves better and the probability of relief increases. You can get in touch with us for the application process. Attach all your documentation with the application and submit to the bank. But please make sure to take a written receiving from the bank for your application with the authorized personnel’s signature and bank’s stamp. Report to your local police station: No, you do not need to go to the cyber cell for reporting these cases. If any responding officer does not entertain your complaint and register the FIR, you can get in touch with us. Reporting an ATM fraud, as little the amount as it may be, is very crucial in order to suggest proactive policy measures to tackle this growing problem. So, it is our humble request to you to kindly take out some time and register the FIR. Follow up: Your first follow up should be with the bank in about 10 days. After a lapse of 90 days, however, you can give an application to the RBI Ombudsman near you about the dispute. There are other methods to get relief after this which falls outside the scope of this post but we will be happy to answer your queries if you have them.In case you have been a victim of an ATM Fraud and are worried, do not panic. Read this post and take the necessary steps. PS: We are not a law enforcement agency. None of our posts constitutes legal advice. "

    "headline": "The Indian Cyber Space – A View from the Rural Area",
    "data": "The Indian Cyber Space has seen tremendous growth in terms of Internet users in the last 2-3 years. The penetration rate now lies at somewhere around 40%, which was a mere 10% in 2013-14. But when we are talking about the Indian Cyber Space, it has to be first demarcated into two areas: first, the urban area and second, the rural area.Everyone is so acquainted with the present scenario in the urban areas but people rarely talk about the incidents in the rural areas.Without any doubt, the present scenario is way better in the urban areas as compared to rural areas. By this comparison, I do not mean that the condition in the urban areas is all fine and good.The major reason for me writing this post is the insights I gathered while delivering a workshop at Government Higher Secondary School, Nagda (District – Dhar, Madhya Pradesh). Around 300 students belonging to different classes from 9th to 12th were present. What came as a surprise for me was their interest in this subject matter. It did not only encourage me but also motivated me to reach more people in the rural areas. I made a number of observations while interacting with those students.Giving an ATM card and a bank account to each and every farmer is a really good scheme. There is nothing wrong with it. But do they how to use it safely? Do they how to differentiate between a fraud call from their bank or a genuine call? Do they even know the name of the crimes related to debit cards?\nSadly, the answer to above questions and more such questions is a big NO.Instagram, Snapchat, etc. are simply the foreign terms. Or in the language of one of the students, I interacted with: “मेने इनस्टॉल तो किया था पर मुझे समझ ही नहीं आया की ये चीज़ क्या है?” (I did install the application but could not understand what actually it is.)One of the students even said that “फेसबुक और व्हाट्सएप्प को चलाना और समझना बहुत आसान है | दूसरी एप्प्लिकेशन को चलाना कठिन भी है और टाइम वेस्ट भी”. (Using Facebook & WhatsApp is quite easy. Other applications are not only difficult, but they are also a waste of time.)Believe me, when I say this, they are really curious people. They are not afraid of technology. Instead, they want to understand and use it. All they need is someone to talk to them in the language they understand. For example, conversational Hindi.Almost 90% of the students present used Facebook & WhatsApp but not even half of them knew that there is something on WhatsApp called Privacy Settings through which they can control what they share.Same was the case when I asked them about Privacy Settings on Facebook. There were barely 2 or hands that were raised as a yes to my question.It takes us back to square one. Since the beginning, we have been a firm believer that awareness is the only solution. It is imperial for an end user to completely know about the services or the applications he is using on a daily basis.All the observations conclude at a singular point for me. With all those big schemes being launched rigorously, can there be a one about sensitization of the rural India? Let’s see what the government, as a prominent stakeholder, or any such organization, comes up with. "

    "headline": "Financial Cyber Crime: How the system is failing the victims",
    "data": "I’d say good luck to you if you are a victim of a financial cyber crime in India and looking for a recourse. When I say financial cyber crime, I refer to all sets of crimes that include vishing scams, ATM skimming and fraudulent withdrawals and transactions. For someone who is visiting our website for the first time, please check out the stuff that we do to help victims of cyber crime across the globe. Through our continued efforts, we have done as much as possible within the legal ambit that we can in helping people and getting back their money.If you are a financial cyber crime victim and the amount of your loss is more than at least 5 lakhs, the police is going to help you perhaps. But if you have just lost some few thousands like Ms. Sonam Mehrotra did (more on the case towards the end), the thana police, the bank, the payment wallets or the Superintendent of Police are not going to bother. Over the last 2 years we have dealt with thousands of cases of financial cyber crimes, been able to get the money back in some and some are still stuck in the system. But over these years, we have been trying our best to help citizens get their money back.All (I’m not saying most now) of these frauds that happen over phone are traced back to West Bengal, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand or Bihar. The ones involving ATMs have no physical boundary. At the stage when this is found out, the local police officer says to the victim one of these things:“It is a case of cyber crime sir, you know how cyber crime is, it doesn’t get solved. No point of wasting your time on such matters, forget about the money”“We are in Delhi right now, sending a police officer to West Bengal for your 30,000 will cost a lot more than you can AFFORD.” “Sorry, we cannot file the FIR right now, go to your bank and file a complaint”In none of these cases is a FIR registered and the victim is hung in the middle between bank and the police, each one of them telling the victim to go to the other.At this stage, the money is in the mobile wallets that do not care a bit about these phony accounts or proper KYC for them. Huge amounts of money are moved into and out of these accounts everyday and there is very little check. If the police, banks and wallets and other services act fast, they can stop fund transfers and refund the money to the victim.In the case of Ms. Mehrotra, she spent a week at stretch trying to reason it out with the police, the bank, OLA money, PayTm and Union bank to stop the transfers from happening. She lost money because her mother in her innocence gave away the OTPs to a fraud caller. This was however reported within 30 minutes and the money could have come back well within time. I spoke to the SP in Shahjahanpur myself, to which all he had to say was, “Send the victim to me, I will see.” When the victim did go, he was explained that it will not be possible for the police to go to Jharkhand and the money involved will be out of the VICTIM’s budget. On calling him again, he hung up the call requesting this time not to waste his time with small cases. She is still fighting the fight as you read this and has been successful in getting back 20,000 out of her total 61,000 from PayTm. At this stage she has been able to narrow down the criminal’s identity and details without any police intervention of any sort. Not just that, the criminal is active and his mobile is still in the switched on mode and being used for more such activities. She is not an isolated case, we have a list of hundreds of other victims who have lost money this way and the criminals are still active.These scammers are targeting all verticals of the society but predominantly the senior citizens for their lack of fluency with technology or the digitally incapable that are a good 70% of the country’s population. The sad part is the figure of 6,91,500 in the six days is only what we received. I estimate that the figure would be at least 10 times more than this. All that these incidents do is raise the question whether digitization is any good if the state doesn’t have the machinery to protect victims. It is only going to create fear in the minds of people and push them to not be a part of the digital revolution in India. "

    "headline": "5 Steps to Immediately take if your nudes are being used to Blackmail YOU.",
    "data": "Sharing nude pictures over WhatsApp, iMessage and other sorts of messengers has become a pretty common activity across age groups today. What ordinarily follows these temporary (thought of as permanent) relationships is revenge porn which is the reason behind so many giving up and committing suicides. The pictures which were then shared voluntarily are now used to blackmail. If you or your loved one is a victim of such a crime please do not feel pathetic about yourself because people are there to help, you just need to ask for it. Please be bold and take the following steps:If you are one of those who goes on like this :STOP.! These messages are a very important source of evidence. By deleting these messages, you are destroying evidence.Often the accused uses fake accounts to blackmail the victim. In some cases, after the account is deactivated the chats are not visible as well. That is why it is best to take a screenshot as soon as you receive such messages. These screenshots are also helpful when filing complaints or gathering preliminary data for investigation. The screenshot should capture the time stamp along with the message.File an FIR or contact the woman helpline service quickly. Often people don’t approach such services because of the fear of giving out these images or lack of adult help. Rest assured, these people are experts and they receive such complaints every day. Your photos will be dealt with confidentially. You may get in touch with us at contact@cyberblogindia.in or on our WhatsApp Helpline at +919340337396 to talk to one of our cyber crime specialists.No matter what the blackmailer says, do not give in to his demands because there is no assurance that he will stop. The only word you need to understand is ‘consent’. If you don’t wish to give it, don’t be forced to.You will just make him feel more powerful and provide him with more material to blackmail you further.Give voice to your pain and talk things out with someone. You will be amazed by the amount of weight that lifts off your chest. You can also reach out to us on our contact details shared earlier and we’ll try our best to help you.In any such case, your photos in these situations are dealt with on a case to case basis. This is not legal advice. If your photos are already shared on WhatsApp, a pornographic website, Facebook or any other platform, it is best you contact the police with adult help as soon as possible.

    "headline": "Sharing pirated movie and music can lead to jail",
    "data": "The problem of piracy in the movie biz does not need introduction. The number of pirated movie copies being openly sold in the market whether secretively or publicly, is massive. Walk into any corner of a local market and you can find people selling DVDs containing your favorite music and movies without any regard to copyright. Then there are those websites where you can “watch movies for free”. What the entire nation needs to understand as one big community is that there is a limit to these free lunches that you think you get. Upon thorough analysis of traffic and search queries it has been found that most people are looking for either this or that but they want a “free download”. The odds have luckily been in our favor that these companies, production houses and businesses don’t usually sue the common man. They try to find the distributors and nab them instead.This becomes the reason for many other problems like ransomware but that is a topic for some other time.  Now, an amendment in the Copyright Act, 1957 made in 2012 has made it clear (as far as the bare reading goes) that even sharing of pirated movie links and files is going to be punishable by law. In my legal opinion, if you look closely at Section 65B of the Act under clause 2 there is a clear demarcation to the point that even when somebody communicates to the public without authority any work from which the Digital Rights Information is removed, he shall be punishable for up to 2 years.  Also read: Sent an obscene photo on a WhatsApp group?When we talk about DRI, it is to read as synonymous to DRM (Digital Rights Management) which means that these are technological safeguards used against copyright infringement. Again, at this stage, it does not make sense to get into the details of all of that. I can give you a perfect example to read right now. You must be aware about on demand video services like Hotstar, Amazon Prime and Netflix etc. They all employ TPMs and DRMs (lingo you can leave aside if it doesn’t bother you, I’ll be happy to take any queries just in case it does). Let us say somebody did circumvent or remove the DRM and got the video without any subscription. Now when it reaches you and you forward it to your friends, this can be termed as communication to the public. Even two people are enough public to give rise to an action.When I compare our situation to some foreign jurisdictions I see, in some nations even file sharing is illegal. One EU case has legalized caching and temporary storage but if the content that is cached is in itself pirated, will that be considered legal as well? That is a question still open ended. Hon’ble Bombay High Court had opined last year that watching pirated content is not illegal but I am still of the legal opinion that even consumption of pirated content should be illegal as per bare reading of Section 63 of the Act.  Good thing is we do not have such law that can make things very difficult but a law that prevents sharing of pirated movie and music links or the files as such is in place. So please be vigilant while you share or send someone something online."

Like many others, I know for a fact that this will be snoozed as well. For another day they said, awareness is a matter for another day. As the world tackles to protect infrastructure and servers whose breach cause catastrophe, lives are being affected, and lost. For any of you blaming it on social media and the digital revolution, I could only partially agree with you.It is not about this blue whale challenge or the selfie madness that has caused deaths, it is the problem that cyber awareness and cyber hygiene is absent among the community members in the country. Yes, victims are spread across the world but even across the world, the problem is the lack of communication in these highly connected times. Cyber Bullying is real, children are facing it but the best most people do it shun them. Sometimes the kids won’t speak and the other times the adults won’t listen. Cyber awareness and hygiene has to be taught to adults and kids alike for there is no censorship on what kids get online. This is not a battle to block access or play blames, but to do something about education in cyber safety.I’ve suggested multiple times and I am of the strong opinion that no cyber security platform or technology can protect an individual who is not aware. It might seem funny but it is as simple as when things were started to be labeled. You are not supposed to touch or eat rat poison because the label says so. You learned how to read and so you know what it says. The Internet and computer technologies have become a part of almost everybody’s lives today and learning their language is important in order to stay safe. One needs to know what the risks are, what kind of cases happen, what all is at stake and what do the victims have to say. All of this, please don’t feel that it is hearsay. On many occasions after workshops, we have had kids come up to us and discuss some very serious problems about cyber bullying which they were ashamed of talking about otherwise. Things get sorted when kids talk to parents and the parents take them seriously or in cases, even a school teacher or a friend who is aware themselves. What we are missing in this heated spur around the blue whale challenge is that it is one of those many challenges that have claimed lives but it is certainly not the last of them. How are you going to protect your friend?Awareness empowers people, it affects them, it is the only driver of change that is bound to bring a change. "

    "headline": "Ethical Hackers in Police Investigation: Is it legal?",
    "data": "The number of incidents with the involvement of third parties like ethical hackers, in criminal and civil investigations is on the rise. More than ever now, I have been dealing with such cases of blatant violation of rights of individuals where proper procedures are not followed.Today, let me talk to you about a recent case that I have been working on. I got this lady as a client who is a director of an international fashion firm. She left an earlier employer in a fashion and model coordination company which is popular and pretty well known in the fashion circuits. She was slapped with a case of Data Theft as an outcry of revenge by her employers. The local police station was bought out and they started gunning for her life to be arrested. Even Section 420 of IPC  was added to make the whole thing non-bailable. According to Hon. Supreme Court’s recent judgment, no one should be arrested for the crime which has Punishment below 7 years of imprisonment unless the accused is absconding, not cooperating, is a threat to society etc. The Supreme Court in another case has held that IT Act,2000 is a Special Act, hence sections of another Act for the same crime will not be applicable unless an offense in the IT Act is made out.Let’s leave this apathy of police. They are a service organisation giving service to the wrong end of the society and this is nothing new. What police did next is that they called a private forensics guy from Pune, who confiscated and kept the accused lady’s laptop in his custody to perform forensics and find data that could suggest her involvement. This can be called a blatant violation of Chain of custody under the Indian Evidence Act, i.e a private investigator handling the evidence and thereby arguably tampering or vitiating it. This ends up in such evidence not being accepted in the courts of law merely for non-adherence to the chain of custody and probable intention to maliciously tamper data on the laptop.The act of interference of the private forensics guy amounts to destruction or tampering of evidence which in itself is a non-bailable offence. Now the heart of this article is what happens next. This Influential complainant is allegedly tipped by some police officials or others to take help of an ethical hacker by the name of Shub** Si*** staying in suburbs of Mumbai. The tipper said this guy helps police in these nefarious activities of hacking and snooping and is paid by virtue of cash or kind. So complainant hires services of this hacker, who hacks into Gmail and other services of this lady victim to find evidence of data theft so as to substantiate for the case. So there are now Ethical hackers on both sides of the isle.Also Read: Money Fraudulently taken from Bank Account- What to do?My Question is,”Under which law and authority do police or LEAs use these services of hackers?” The Police definitely have better intentions to protect the society but why are these experts not enlisted? Neither is it found what they (the hackers) do in their part time, how do they make money for a living, their means or whether they are doing it under the banner of the police forces. These hackers supposedly get a license to hack the moment they click pictures with police officers or when they train some police officials.I feel the Police needs to make databases of all such hackers who want to serve the nation, which happens to be their punch line. Police should inform them that, even hacking for police is a crime and stealing data for police also not legal, because as per law, there can be separate actions for violation of the Consitutional rights and other offenses under the IT Act against the person who contravenes and commits such offences. As a matter of fact, in an unrelated case however, the Delhi High Court has also opined that informers or the people who have access to secret information (Khabris, as they are called) cannot be relied upon as good samaritans because they were/are part of some illegal network.  The best analogy that I can think of is that the police avails services of Key Maker and he gets a blanket permission to break into houses of citizens, thereby earning his livelihood.Now, all this critique does not mean that I am against it. It’s time that the State makes a policy for taking services of hackers and to pay them officially, otherwise, incidents like Eknath Khadse will keep happening. I am not against lawful hackers, I am against such hackers who are desperate to showcase their skills and make money, and for this sole motive hack into a husband’s or a wife’s account to lead them to divorces. I am against such hackers who to please one party, hack into another parties account when the matter is with police or court, thereby becoming criminals themselves. I want first of all these “Ethical Hackers” as titles to be abolished and have a respectable name for them, probably “Cyber Security Researchers.” I want that, if they are earning money in Bugbounty or other good ways they should declare their money in income tax returns and State should give them a subsidy.It is not a matter of “when” anymore. It is a matter of how fast you cope up. Because the cyber space is evolving at a massive rate and also the number of so called ethical hackers.About the Author: The author of this post is Advocate Prashant Mali, one of India’s leading Cyber Lawyer and Cyber Security Expert.

    "headline": "Job frauds: lost money online?",
    "data": "Job frauds?  You mean these days? Who falls victims to these frauds, It is so careless and stupid to fall prey to such a fraud.Well, I am not of this opinion. Fake job frauds are on the rise with every passing day because of easy information access to criminals. At that peak of frustration and agony when one does not have a job, he does fall into such traps. Something similar happened with Jyoti, a native of Jaipur who lost about 7500 INR to such an online fraud. She had registered with Naukri.com, a very popular job search portal.One fine day she receives a call from a number claiming to be from Naukri and telling her that her profile had been shortlisted for a job. She was made to take an online test after a payment of Rs. 1500 via Paytm. This is a very standard modus operandi of job frauds these days. When she did not clear the test,  she asked for a refund. And as professionally as it happened, they asked her for the card details of the card she had used on Paytm to give them that money. She complied even with all her other credentials. Another 6000 INR is withdrawn, this time leaving her with no money. They ignored her thereafter leaving her no options. Ever since, she had been making cold calls to them and requesting money. Skeptical about going to the police, it is my personal claim (not a haywire figure, but a claim) that at least 70% people do not report such crime. But when they do, like an old retired teacher did from New Delhi, he was told by the police that 20,000 is a very petty loss, we are dealing with cases that involve lacs of rupees. Of course, the file is there but it is under a lot of weight. Another officer moral policed a girl in Bangalore about sharing her intimate pictures over the Internet leaving her with no choice at all. But this post is not about that.Also read our post on What to do if money gets withdrawn from your account fraudulently. Anyway, Jyoti reached out to us for help. My first instinct, still as a law abiding citizen is to request her to go to the police and ask them for help. She was panicking. That money might not mean a lot to you reading this but to her it meant a lot, probably close to everything. As you read this, the police is investigating this case and they will find out the culprits hopefully.But in this case, we took a stand. Yes, I made a call to these criminals and used all tricks in the book which of course are not something to be divulged here. But I am happy to share that whatever loss Jyoti had suffered 2 weeks ago, has been compensated and the money has been returned in totality to her. Yes, all of the 7500 and by the criminals themselves. There are so many cases like this job fraud and others that we get everyday and in so many we have the culprit’s Paytm numbers, their mobile numbers which are active but there is so little that we can do in the non-law-enforcement space. Of course, we do report it to the authorities for action and they do take action but these incidents call out for a better public-private partnership model with the state at least in the domain of reporting and solving cyber crime.Read what Jyoti had to sayThe dynamics are different, the vectors are diversified but the losses, they are abominable and awful."

    "headline": "30 days in Mumbai",
    "data": "This summer we (Nitish and I) got lucky enough to grab an opportunity to work with Advocate Prashant Mali, an eminent cyber law expert for a month at his prestigious law firm Cyber Law Consulting (Advocates & Attorneys) which is one of the premier law firms of the country dealing in the core area of Cyber Law.  This was the first experience of learning from a lawyer who is practically and factually one of the best in the country.  As we waited for him to arrive on the first day in office, we could not help but gaze at the numerous achievements which adorned his office wall. The 30-day tenure had in store for us more than what we had expected.Arriving at BombayOver this period we got to visit the Thane District Court, the Esplanade Court popularly known as the Fort Court and the Bombay High Court for hearings. And these were not mere cases, some of them landmark and some sensitive and crucial. But through all these cases he sat us down and took every possible opportunity to tell us about the intricacies of the job and quick tips. We visited some corporates to attend high level meetings regarding crucial matters like legal compliances. It would be apt to mention here that Cyber Law Consulting also has an in house government empaneled forensic lab which houses state of the art tech. One of the most unique experience included working in this forensics lab and performing experiments (details cannot be divulged however). Unlike other workplaces or labs which probably would just show you what they do from a distance, we were encouraged to go ahead and use the tools and systems for better understanding. We were also made to do a lot of research work which helped us look at the same IT Act from so many different perspectives. We got an opportunity to assist Advocate Mali in a workshop he delivered at A H Wadia High School as well.Found myself gawking at the culturally rich heritage around Courts in South Bombay \nA visit to Cyber Police Station                                        In the last week, we also got an opportunity to attend the Indo French conference on FinTech where Advocate Mali was a keynote speaker and we met some national and international experts working in the domain. The best experience was a visit to the Adjudicating Officer which very few get to witness. The proceedings went on till after office hours up to about 7 pm which made it a fruitful day where the Adjudicating Officer came to certain conclusions after discussions and inputs from advocates present for speedy disposal of cases.Advocate Mali as a keynote speaker at Indo- French Fintech ConferenceThe office was a cozy workspace with no corporate shenanigans. Occasional chit chat over a cup of tea on varied topics such as happenings and developments in the domain, Maharashtrian culture, food joints around Mumbai etc. was a common break time activity. Sir ensured that we got a taste of all possible verticals associated with practice in the one month period. Not just a mentor, he was a cool mentor. He would often order delicacies for us from the nearby food joints. Whenever it was a court day, he would not miss a lunch break to make us try something new. He even took us and all his colleagues to Alibaugh for a weekend getaway (and all of this by freeing up space from his busy schedule). The trip saw some beach visits, haunted stories, lots of coconut water and traditional Maharashtrian food at One of his relative’s who welcomed us with all the warmth. The taste of home made mango Shrikhand is something I still cannot take out of my mind.Morning at Akshi Beach, Alibaugh !I have no idea when the 30 days came to an end. The internship was as much fun as it was educating. We left with some of the best gifts; a book on History of Bombay’s Chamber of Commerce and home made dry garlic chutney which is a part of every meal I have at home these days.  We left with countless memories and an extended family. What we learned in these 30 days was not just law but also the art of lawyering and how to be a better person. These 30 days in Mumbai were memorable and special. Say Hi to the team 🙂 "

    "headline": "The Indian Data Protection & Privacy Law: Rights I should have",
    "data": "The Advocate-General of India, Mr. Mukul Rohatgi has recently stated in his submissions to the honorable Supreme Court that the Government is working on a Data Protection & Privacy Law. The AG also said that TRAI has already started drafting this framework. The Government is expecting to enact it by Diwali.Privacy and protection of data are two of the most sensitive topics in cyberspace. Although the Indian Law is set to deal with them specifically as per the earlier report, the Information Technology Act has only helped LEAs and the courts to an extent. The present condition could have become even worse if we did not have detailed criminal laws like the Indian Penal Code.When we talk about data protection and privacy laws in the recent times, one name that stands out is GDPR. The European General Data Protection Rights, 2016 is due to come into effect on May 25, 2018. It is being touted as the most stringent data privacy law around the world.GDPR has introduced penalties on the data controllers and processors for not complying with reasonable cyber security practices. The prescribed penalties are as high as ₹ 140 crores. It is also applicable to the companies which are not established in the Union. In short, if there is any company that deals with the data of any person residing in the European Union, it comes under the ambit of GDPR.Apart from the penalties and reasonable cyber security practices, GDPR also gives a number of rights to a data subject. For the purpose of this legislation, a data subject is a natural person residing in the European Union. You can read more about GDPR here.The Indian Data Protection & Privacy law- Rights I should haveThe Information Technology Act, 2000 has been the only law dealing specifically with cyber crimes in India. Considering the dynamic nature of cyber crimes and ever evolving nature of technology, the IT Act has been criticized for its effectiveness even after the amendments made over the last 17 years. .Coming back to what the AG said, there are a few rights (as prescribed by GDPR) that the Indian Data Protection & Privacy law should have as well.A data subject has an exclusive right to ask for any information related to the collection of his personal data. Under Article 12, one can ask for the following details when he has given his consent for the collection of data:Purpose & Interest behind the collection of his personal data,The list of recipients receiving his data,The period for which the company will store his data,Identity and contact details of the company, andDetails of the Data Protection Officer (DPO).When a company has collected personal data without the consent of the person concerned, the company is responsible to:Give all the details as mentioned above,Inform the person concerned about the collection of his personal data, andExpressly mention the categories of collected personal data.Article 15 gives a right to access to the data subjects of the Union. Adding this right in Indian Data Protection & Privacy law will ensure that an Indian citizen has right to access following information:Different types of the details as mentioned above, andDetails of the third party (or an international organization) to which data is being transferred.Also, a data subject can get a copy of his personal data from the concerned company or organization.Inclusion of this right will give a legal remedy to the citizens in getting their data rectified. This will substantially reduce the number of cases of misrepresentation due to the inaccuracy of the data collected. Article 16 of GDPR deals with this right.Under Article 17 of GDPR, a data subject can ask for the removal of his personal data without any delay under following conditions:Purpose behind the data collection has been achieved,The data subject has withdrawn his consent given and there is no legal ground for further processing of his personal data,The data subject objects to processing of his personal data under Article 21,The organization has done unlawful processing of data,There is a legal obligation for erasure of data.In India, there is no specific legal provision dealing with this right. Recently, Kerala HC allowed an appeal to remove the name of petitioner from the copy of judgment available online. (You can read more about this judgement here)\\ Moreover, the Right to be Forgotten will also help the victims in cases of Revenge Pornography & Hate Crimes.Under Article 21, a data subject can object to the use of his personal data. He can also restrict a data processor or a data controller under Article 22. With the help of this right, a data subject can opt out of becoming a part of the automated decision-making process. The automated decision-making process includes advertisements, customer behaviors, etc.The only data protection law in India is the set of supplementary IT Rules to the Act which do somewhat lay down guidelines for companies collecting sensitive data of users. In some ways, they do touch upon some of the provisions of the GDPR as well yet there are some flaws in the backdrop. "

    "headline": "Are clickwrap agreements valid in India?",
    "data": "There have been many international decisions on this point and the legal situation is pretty clear. Clickwrap agreements can be looked at as those where you click on I agree, under the T&C, be it Facebook, Gmail or any such service provider. Generally, clickwrap agreements are valid in the eyes of law. What are relevant today are the mass contract clickwrap agreements. By the decision in Hotmail Corporation v. Van Money Pie, clicking of an ‘I agree’ button at the bottom of a terms and conditions page was considered sufficient to conclude a contract.The judicial authorities in India, however, have not commented on the legal position of such clickwrap agreements. Generally, when there had been gross inequality of bargaining power, contracts were said to be unconscionable (Central Inland Water Corp v. Brojo Nath). If we go by the principles discussed in the Brojo Nath case, then, such mass contracts would be all invalid. But that should not be the case.In a judgment given by the Income Tax Tribunal in 2017, clickwrap agreements were discussed. In the case of Ddit (It) 3(1), Mumbai vs Gujrat Pipavav Port Ltd., the Tribunal expressed serious doubts about the enforceability of such clickwrap contracts. The instant case was dealing with issues of copyright infringement but a reference to clickwrap agreements was needed in context. The doubt, in this case, has been talked about by the Tribunal in the manner:Suppose, in case of a company, a product is purchased by the staff of the company, for its use in regular course of work or business of the company and an employee of the company while installing the software on the computer in the office of the company clicks the button or the icon ‘I agree’ and thereafter such an employee or any other employee of the company violates any condition of the license agreement, can such license agreement be enforced against the company or the Directors of the company can be held liable for any such infringement, especially when they are not signatories to such an agreement and nor they have authorized any employee of the company to sign any agreement on behalf of the company and even no name of the company is even written in such type of agreement and even it is also not known as to who actually clicked the button ‘I agree.’ Under these circumstances, the enforceability of such a license is highly doubtful.The Tribunal further added and it needs to be highlighted here:So far as the legal enforceability of such Licence Agreements is concerned, in spite of the fact that it may fulfill all the requirements of a valid contract, such an agreement may not be enforceable, if, its stipulations conflict with the law governed in the country where such licenses are intended to be enforced, or if it is an unconscionable or unreasonable bargain.It can be summarized that although the requirements of a valid contract may be fulfilled in cases, but ifThere is some contravention with the law of the land, orWhere the contract is an unreasonable bargain.The tribunal added that, in these cases, where the contract terms are numerous and in high detail, users often don’t read through the terms but that does not affect the validity of such a contract unless the terms are unconscionable. Though this does not clear the legal position of clickwrap contracts in entirety, it does shed some light on how the judicial bodies feel about online contracts."

    "headline": "Madras High Court says electronic evidence is admissible under Sec 62 without 65B certificate",
    "data": "At this stage itself, I find it imperative to direct our readers to this post about Digital Evidence Law in India. Before talking about the recent order of the Madurai Bench of the High Court, we must take a look at what is the difference between primary and secondary electronic evidence.Primary Electronic Evidence, legally speaking is something a lawyer would move to get admitted under Section 62 of the Indian Evidence Act which reads,Primary evidence means the document itself produced for the inspection of the Court.Now, there is an inherent need for a lawyer to be the Sherlock in this case. There is a very thin line, technically speaking, between a document or any file on your computer, mobile or tablet being primary and the same being secondary on being produced in another medium. By the basic technological analogy which the techies will understand is that whenever a file is even copy-pasted into another location, it essentially, does not remain the original. Now this is a two edged sword which a lawyer could either use for his case to present a contention or to defend against one, depending upon the case.Coming to the order of the Court, it is not of much relevance, the actual matter of the case. It is because in this case, the party presenting a CD containing some evidence, presented it towards the end of the case when almost proceedings were over. Also, no supporting documents with the contents of the CD and its relevance were submitted and there was some procedural flaw in absence of certain required signatures as well. What steamed the debate was this observation of the Hon’ble court,“Admissibility of the secondary evidence of electronic record depends upon the satisfaction of the conditions as enumerated under Section 65-B of the Evidence Act. On the other hand, if primary evidence of electronic record adduced that is the original record itself is produced in Court under Section 62, the same is admissible in evidence without compliance with the conditions in Section 65(b).”\nThere has been a spur after this particular observation but technically speaking, this was the position all along. Section 65A was always worded to mean that electronic records may be proved as per Sec 65B which clearly means that there has to be other ways to prove electronic evidence. This is best looked at by way of an example:Suppose you are trying to enter into evidence a conversation between two people. Now anything other than the actual chat on the actual phone that it happened on, is secondary evidence. If you produce a screenshot on a CD, even then it is a secondary evidence. Now, technically speaking, if you produce the screenshot as it was created by the pressing of the buttons on your smartphone and stored on your local memory, then by producing your smartphone in the Court, you can prove the screenshot, but not the actual conversation. The defense will always have the argument of challenging the fact that the screenshot is of a doctored chat screen. The best way or the primary way to admit a chat would be actually producing the smartphone.By this analogy, no call records can be primary evidence because the actual server can never be moved into the court room. Therefore, it is a correct observation of the High Court that anything which is primary evidence may be admitted by virtue of Section 62 of the Act but the moment it becomes secondary, there has to be mandatory certificate under Section 65A and 65B. It is also important to point out here that it is totally possible to prove whether a file was originally created or copied from somewhere else before being produced to the court. This opens way for forensics like never before and creates a big space for lawyers to explore. "

    "headline": "How to protect yourself from ransomware data loss?",
    "data": "No, anti-ransomware is not going to protect you. Neither is a high end firewall, nor a sophisticated software. I know of cases of theft of data where victims have been across all possible domains. Defense personnel, Techies, Lawyers and Security Researchers are just a few out of all. The problem is that most of us are okay with being infected with ransomware. Yes, when I tell someone to adopt a particular security strategy, the best they have to say is that their data is worth nothing and that who would want to hack them. At the end, these are the people who have paid up as much as 50,000 INR to get their data back.For someone who has no idea about ransomware, you can refer to this post first. Let’s move ahead if you know what ransomware is.The reason is simple: this year onwards, ransomware is no more targeted at businesses, they have taken a step ahead and moved towards home users. And the fact that we are writing about it in such urgency should tell you that it has reached India. Biggest sources of ransomware today are torrents, free download links and above all, Emails.I wish there was  a bulletproof way that everyone could adopt. I am not going into things that professionals can do because that might become very difficult for some of our readers to implement. I will keep it simple and brief. The best way to protect yourself proactively is, first of all: Download Safe. We have dealt with this issue in detail here. Another important point to note is not to download files sent to you via Emails from people you don’t know. Mails without subjects and sent to weird Email IDs should be totally ignored. Having said all\nof this, I would like to center this post around the topic of Data Management as a tool to protect yourself against ransomware.Data management is not about organizing your data into folders and adding beautiful icons to it. In times of failure, whether your data is available at someplace else is what determines if your data has been managed well. That is how I like to see it, anyway. You get hit by ransomware, your device is locked. Now all you can do is pay up. But the reason that you pay up is your data majorly. What all is available online like your Facebook account and your Gmail data, you don’t really care. An efficient Data Management strategy will include: (Sharing from my personal experience):Mirroring all your local data on the cloud. (GoogleDrive, OneDrive, Box, Dropbox etc.) This helps you locate all your important data in case of a ransomware attack. Well, atleast you would not have to pay up.Offline mirroring is important as well. Buy a secondary external hard disk and back up your data on it.The next question is frequency. For someone like me, I have scheduled my data backups both online and on my hard drive for once is 3 days. If your need is rather more, you can keep it at once a day or even twice a day. All of that depends on your use.Add a good level of encryption to your secondary hard drive so that the ransomware cannot access your drive.For your cloud, passwords and 2FA are most important.This is a brief overview of what can be done in order to have an efficient data management strategy to protect yourself from ransomware related data loss. All you need to do is be ready, your security is your own responsibility."

    "headline": "Sent an obscene photo on a WhatsApp group?",
    "data": "I’ve been struck with question about obscene content so many times that I feel writing about it is the best solution. I want to analyze this question on two different levels: Moral and Legal. We’ve come across cases where girls and guys have sent their private intimate pictures on WhatsApp groups “by mistake”. The very fact that they were meant to be sent to someone else is alarming as well. The problem with WhatsApp and other instant messengers is that people feel “privacy”. They feel that communication is happening one to one and none else will ever see their intimate moments. The Internet is powerful and Information Communication Technologies are revolutionary but the fact that users feel that there is a different set of ethics online, is not right.Morally, Would you click nude pictures, print them, lock them in a box and send via post? If your answer is no, you really need to understand how communication is happening for you right now. There are many intermediaries involved in the entire chain of data flow. We are not the moral police, neither do we want to be. But we are concerned, mostly because of the kind of cases that we receive. So many girls just want to stop that one message from being delivered that ruined their lives. You might read this post and go back to sexting and sharing intimate moments via instant messaging. I don’t hope that some revolutionary change will occur but if even one of the people reading this change their behavior online, it is a great start for us.Legally, In law, there is a huge debate all the time about whether something is “obscene”. As per the Indian law, it is pretty much settled but not going into the details of that, I would like to point out Section 67 and 67A of the IT Act, which primarily cover sharing content with people. As for sending nude pictures, I have already covered it here. Even content that is obscene in other forms may fall under Section 67 of the Act and can attract punishment. The word “lascivious” in the Act is pretty wide and can be known to include instances of inciting lust and depraving prurient individuals. That is all the legal lingo that you can avoid for now. Rest assured, It is pretty much common sense for you, at least broadly to identify whether something is obscene. The deeper details are anyway taken up by the courts. Sticking to the question at hand, It makes sense to sum up here that if you have sent a message, an image, a document, a video, a voice note or any media to a WhatsApp group or an individual and that content is obscene, it can attract punishment under law.So, it is a humble request to please go back to the basics and enforce your offline ethics to your online life as well. As strange as it may seem, just while writing this post, we received another case where a School Teacher forwarded an Email containing a pdf file titled “course plan” to his colleagues’ group on Gmail. He did not check the pdf because it was pretty obvious to him that it would be the course plan. He’s facing litigation as you read this for just one mistake. I’ll not go into the details of the case here but you can always talk to us to know more."

    "data": "On December 12th 2016, In Sharat Babu Digumarti vs. Govt. of NCT [Judgment from LiveLaw], the Supreme Court heard claims of both the parties regarding a wide variety of issues. The main portion relevant for this post is with reference to the dispute between IT Act and the IPC. The Attorney General’s opinion was also taken by the Hon’ble court in this matter who highlighted that Section 67 of the IT Act that talks about publishing obscene content overrides Section 292 of the IPC when used for publishing obscene content online. It has been seen that in practice because of lack of awareness among the LEA officers, most of the accused are charged with Section 292 of the IPC and often Section 67 is ignored. To make it clear at this point, Section 292 of the IPC talks about punishment for sale, distribution, advertisement etc. of obscene content and Section 67 specifically talks about sharing or causing to share obscene content in the electronic form.The court also went on to analyse the parallels between electronic material and records as per the Indian Evidence Act. It was held that all electronic material can fall under “records” within theAct. The main conclusion that this leads to is that almost all electronically published content can be included under the IT Act without any doubt. However, paragraph 28 of the judgment lays down the most relevant opinion of the court, “The said provision read with Section 67A and 67B is a complete code relating to the offences that are covered under the IT Act. All provisions will have their play and significance, if the alleged offence pertains to offence of electronic record. It has to be borne in mind that IT Act is a special enactment. It has special provisions. Section 292 of the IPC makes offence sale of obscene books, etc. but once the offence has a nexus or connection with the electronic record the protection and effect of Section 79 cannot be ignored and negated.”This pretty much boiled down to the court observing that if no case was made out under Section 67 then the remedy under Section 292 IPC will also not be available. This was held because the accused was already acquitted of the offence under Section 67 and charges under Section 292 were being continually pressed. This judgment reiterates the concept of Generalia Specialibus Non Derogant meaning that a general statute must yield to a special one."

    "headline": "Not possible to ban sardar jokes, but criminally punishable",
    "data": "In 2015, A two judge bench of the Hon’ble apex court headed by Ex-Chief Justice T.S. Thakur had agreed to hear a PIL seeking ban on jokes against the Sardar community. In the list of contentions drawn out by Shiromani Gurudwara Prabandhak Committee (SGPC), things like “racial profiling” and “bullying/ragging” were highlighted.The PIL was filed seeking a ban on Sardar jokes promulgation both online and offline. It was welcomed by the then Chief Justice but in the latest hearing by a new bench headed by Justice Dipak Misra, all hopes of an entire “ban” have taken a dive. Earlier, the court had sought guidelines from the applicants about ways to curb this menace that was causing cultural problems for the young Sikhs.The recent proceedings however saw the court being reluctant on framing any guidelines as such about a complete ban. Justice Misra, while speaking to SGPC said, “Anyone can take recourse of section 67A of IT Act (Punishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form) , 499 or 500 IPC (defamation) ..how can we under article 32 lay down guidelines ? What kind of guideline can we issue pertaining to a particular community?”[Source: LiveLaw]Section 67 with respect to sharing obscene content is also relevant for filing any complaints. After the Sharat Babu Digumarti judgment, it is a settled matter of law that any relief in cases of electronic media being used, an offence under the IT Act should primarily be made out. Without that, a proceeding under any other penal law will not hold good.The case is listed for final judgment on March 27th 2017. However, the stand of the Hon’ble court looks pretty much clear. In practice as well, a general guideline will pretty much be technically impossible to implement. It will lead to a lot of chaos and blocking of legitimate content as well. This however, leads us to the conclusive belief that obscene jokes can be a matter criminal prosecution. So the next time you share some laughs, please watch out. "

    "headline": "Dinesh Bareja on Online Safety",
    "data": "I had a chance to speak to Mr. Dinesh Bareja, COO, IndiaWatch (LinkedIn) and who is also a famous name in the Information Security landscape globally. I was initially hoping to write a piece about Cyber Security Advice from experts around the globe. But this one that I got from Mr. Dinesh Bareja had to be made into a post. The premise of this post and the objective is just to bring to you simple and logical tips to protect yourself online. I know you don’t really fancy those “use longer passwords” posts, so, be assured that this is not one of them. These are all crisp and to the point answers. Please do read through the entire post.If you were to give one safety advice to the Internet using generation of today, what would it be?There is no free lunch, so just be wary of any free stuff being offered, or any deep discounts or easy money offers. Just use your common sense and try to understand the logic which (usually) will not make sense. Then run away from the offer – if it is genuine they will follow up maturely, but if it is a scam you can be prepared for an aggressive follow-up! Finally, before you say yes, ask yourself if you really believe you have such good luck that some unknown person(s) will make you super rich in such a short time. Like I said this has no logic!One classic example of such fraud driven by impotent logic is this fraud committed by a Noida based company.In our experience so far, we’ve seen that apart from the high end Critical Infrastructure hacks, most incidents could have been prevented by just some basic awareness. What do you feel about that?The key phrase is “common sense” and this is missing in all that we do online. People are usually alone when posting online, so they think no one is watching and end up doing things (or saying things) that they would not dare in real life. They lose a sense of reality and realize the mistake too late.Do you feel that there needs to be some difference between the way people behave online vs offline? (For example, the kind of things that we write online, many of us wouldn’t say that to a person or to a group of persons offline)You are right to think that if people just “take care” more than half the crimes and incidents will be avoided. Check the cyber crimes that are reported and the common trend is that it is usually a kid."

    "headline": "[Review] Genie WiFi Router: Made In India",
    "data": "Recently, I happened to speak to the founder of OpenNetware, Mr. Mangesh Bhamre about their startup and recent initiatives. Some 10 minutes into the talk, I shared with him a common problem that many schools and households face: content filtering and protection of Children online. Speaking from my experience so far, this problem of Internet Security is widely felt by almost all citizen groups. It was then that I learned about Genie- a WiFi router that they have built not just to filter content that is sensitive in nature but even for protecting our day to day transactions. I had the urge to check it out because never had I seen a product like this of the Indian market origin.I have used this router on my home connection for about 15 days now. There are many things that people can say about having to invest in a router a high amount when they can just install antiviruses, anti-spyware, anti-ransomware and what not. The idea behind security in the coming years is not going to be dispersed and scattered. It will be centralized. When you have multiple devices, would you want different antivirus installations on your devices or just your router to do it all for you. Filtering the junk at the source is what is really going to protect people. Protecting yourself at the level of internet access is, in fact a great idea!In this post, I will not list out all the features. Instead, I will share some interesting things about this router which I found to be really cool and the “cons” as well.Pros:Out of the box set up: You do not need to know too much in order to set up the router. It took me around one minute to get internet running with the default settings.3 different SSIDs, meaning that once you turn on the router, you can see three different WiFi names, One would be the main SSID, one childsafe and one for guest access. Default passwords and default panel passwords are in the box. If you are purchasing the router, please change these defaults.No VPN access on Childsafe: Probably I don’t need to mention that pornography and all other sort of content displaying websites are blocked. But what needs to be mentioned is that often circumvention is done of these technologies using VPNs. This problem has been tackled well. On the main SSID however, one can access VPN as well.Tor or no Tor: The functionality to allow or disallow TOR browser connections has also been provided in the Administrator panel. So if you would like to give access, it is as simple as checking a box.Filtering is pretty good: On YouTube and Google Searches even, the content filtering is done perfectly. A search for porn did not show up any “pornographic” content in the results of YouTube and other media websites as well for that fact.Adblock: The router even blocks certain ads at the router level but I feel a browser extension is still needed for getting rid of some annoying ones.All the other features of a high-end Home Router: It has all the recommended security settings for a router and other functionality like bandwidth control on different SSIDs as well. (You can limit the speed at which your guests can use the WiFi.)Cons:Some phishing websites are not blocked but the reason for which is that there are new ones every second. This still falls in favor of Genie.Even though the device is out of the box, the functionalities like blocking TOR and VPN are only understandable by people who are savvy enough.You can visit this link to purchase a router from Amazon. All in all, it is a great product and a must have for the ones looking at monitoring and filtering content at their homes, schools and offices. We are still in the process of testing for any other security flaws in this router. Any updates will be made here. "

    "headline": "Right to be forgotten surfaces in India",
    "data": "The Right to be forgotten as the name suggests is a right that enables people to have something about them be forgotten. Alternatively, to be removed from the public domain. There could so much information about you on the Internet. Not all of it of course you would love. But this right would not mean that you are going to be allowed to claim everything to be taken down. In the context of the Internet, this right has been discussed by us previously. This would empower you to ask websites, search engines and other such intermediaries to pull down certain information about you. Hence, the Right to be “forgotten”.As reported by Livelaw.in, India has witnessed its first case where this right has been approved by the Court. The High Court of Karnataka through an order has directed its Registry to enforce this right. This is to the effect that an internet search made in the public domain would not reflect the name of the person involved. The High Court conclusively observed, “This is in line with the trend in Western countries of ‘right to be forgotten’ in sensitive cases involving women in general and highly sensitive cases involving rape or affecting the modesty and reputation of the persons involved.”To read the entire case, you may head over to Livelaw.in.There’s another pending case with the High Court of Delhi which is to the same effect of removal of judgment containing names of relatives of one person. Often people have to undergo suffering because of some really embarrassing things about them on the Internet. It looks like the Right to be Forgotten regime in India is slowly developing and with it, the right to privacy as well. That said, court orders and other judicial writing will still contain names of people and these cannot be hidden unless mandated legally. If there is something about you on the Internet which is not true, no longer relevant, illegal or overstates the original issue, then you may enforce your right to be forgotten.Also, read how to get Revenge Porn videos removed from the Internet. "

A scam of this type has been busted for the first time.The fraudsters swindled close to 3700 Crore from 7 lakh people via a trading website, socialtrade.biz. The website invited people to be a member by paying an amount ranging between Rs. 5,750 to Rs 57,500. After this fake links were sent to people by clicking on which people could make Rs. 5 per click. The masterminds behind the online trading scam, Abhinav Mittal, Shridhar Prasad and Mahesh Dayal are BTech graduates.Ad services have been trending for a while and people use these to make money which is totally genuine. Some of the legitimate ones are Google Adsense and Infolinks. It is important to understand the modus operandi of these services and how you make money via them. Incomplete knowledge and the desire to earn money the easy way is what leads people to fall victims to such traps. It is high time people realize that making money via the internet is not as easy as clicking on a link. The sad part is educated people are putting their knowledge to inadequate use and are exploiting the public.In this case, the fraudsters made people click on links giving them the leverage of money. These scams have often been seen to serve headlines like “make money at home”, “make 15000 per month while studying”, “earn as a house wife” etc. However genuine ad services work in a totally different way. The user creates a website and enrols for hosting ads on the website. People surfing the users website when click on the ads posted, the user gets a fixed amount of money per click."

    "headline": "How to get Revenge Porn videos removed?",
    "data": "This post about Revenge Porn is based on the queries that we receive from numerous people across the country. And honestly, we did not have a clear answer  about revenge porn removal until we did some digging. First of all, revenge porn is a growing menace on all Social Media platforms and even the websites that serve porn videos.For those who do not know, revenge porn is a term used to cover all cases where estranged girlfriends/boyfriends/husbands/wives post intimate pictures or videos of their partners online out of hatred or for revenge. This generally happens when one partner cheats, breaks up or simply does something that instigates the other one. Revenge porn videos have been among most trending user searches and these involve portrayal of someone who has at times consented to be filmed in a sexual act and sometimes not. Distribution of such pictures, videos, messages etc classifies as an offence irrespective of the consent of partner.The term “revenge porn” has generally been referred to uploading of sexually explicit material to humiliate the subject, who has broken off the relationship. Revenge porn videos have often been referred to as hate porn. So much so we don’t like to hear about these things, but they do exist in India and it is time to address the Elephant in the room.Cyber Security Expert, Rakshit Tandon says that no matter illegal or legal, what happens after a video like this gets uploaded on the Internet, the experience is traumatizing not just for the victim but the entire family. We should not engage in clicking pictures/recording videos that we would not like to be uploaded on the Internet someday.The best idea is to report the case of revenge porn to your nearest police station/cyber cell. An FIR is the first way ahead. But I understand when 70% of the victims/their relatives do not want to go to the police for the fear of things being public. It is high time to get this idea out of your head! It is a sane idea to contact the authorities now than to regret later.  Nonetheless, now there are a few ways in which you can take some steps yourself.Contact the website owner. You can either find the name and details of the website owner from their contact page. If not you can look at the Whois Records. Simply add the URL and it will show you the details of the registrant. Ask the owner exclusively to remove the content depicting you. You have the copyright over anything that you are directly shown in.If the revenge porn is on Social Media, Facebook let’s say, the process is fairly simple. Facebook has incorporated the Report feature. All social media websites even otherwise have this feature of reporting. Even those that don’t, you can write an Email to the owner/authorized person.If you want revenge porn to not be shown in Google search results, there is a way for that as well. You can simply fill out this form and get explicit content depicting you, removed. This link for Bing, YouTube, InstagramSome of the culprits are using a blogger platform to upload revenge porn. You can report the content of a Blogger platform here.The ultimate: Porn Websites? Yes, it is possible to get revenge porn videos removed from porn websites also. A major pornography network has come out with the policy to remove revenge porn within 24-48 hours of reporting.If ultimately a video/picture depicting you is available on the Internet, you can file an FIR to find the culprit and get justice but it takes time. Meanwhile, you must file another case with the court requesting orders against the websites to take down the content in question and the also the ISPs to block such content in transit.Adv. Prashant Mali has shared his expertise about real live cases that he had to handle. He says,“Complete removal of viral sexually explicit content takes a lot of time. Sadly 100% removal is next to impossible. Among several cases I have handled so far one case was of a new Actress. The woman had worked in Adult cinema having sex scenes which were only meant to be released abroad. However, the sexually explicit clips of this young model and actress were uploaded by the staff of film production house. Every porn website started showing those clips. I was successful in removing the clips from 95 percent of websites by sending takedown notices individually. However, the mirror sites and new sites which did not have contact details still have the clips. Also from the sites where these clips are removed, they still have screenshots showing this actress. This has negatively affected her career in ways that cannot be undone as these show up in Google searches.”"

Facebook has done this by bringing forth a new security feature today for the security enthusiasts. Many people did not find the two-factor authentication system via SMS and the app generator quite convenient all the time, hence Facebook went ahead with this step.Now you can secure your account with a device that is inserted in the USB port of your laptop.  This device commonly referred to as a USB security key is a small pen drive lookalike which acts as the new 2nd factor of authentication for your accounts. You will still need to enter your password as usual on the login screen but without this USB key, you cannot log in.  You can get through the authentication process just by a tap on the key. To add the key to your Facebook account, you will need to go toSettings > Security > Login Approvals > Security KeysAdd the USB key for Facebook hereInteroperability being one its major feature, the key can be used to manage account security for various platforms such as Github, DropBox, Gmail etc.One such key is available for purchase on Amazon India. Many other versions of key are also available on Amazon. The basic key allows you to login directly with a tap and can be purchased here. The advanced version adds further security to your account such as the OTP functionality, dual slots on OpenPGP and OATH etc. That is all the technical lingo. For now, these higher variants are not recommended for a new user. If you are interested in taking the next step for your security, you can start with the initial variant. You can make the purchase based on your needs and extent of security you need for your accounts. Moreover also consider the kind of data that you are trying to protect.Rather than putting it to words, I believe a video would be more helpful. "

    "data": "Financial security is a rising concern now. Credit it to the demonetization or whatever, people have become a little accustomed to using mobile wallets, UPI apps and above all, swiping cards. It is intriguing to watch people at petrol pumps and grocery stores. Some of them are happy (satisfied in a way) and some really worried about swiping cards.I came across a message on WhatsApp that went on to say the following (in a gist):Some well dressed courier boy came at the doorstep of a family with a courier. Politely, he handed them the courier but without any information about who was it from. This guy even gave them a Wine bottle which wasn’t in the packet because “it had to be handled differently” and there were some special courier charges attached.Most of you at this stage would say that we wouldn’t believe someone like that! Trust me, even the smartest and the wittiest have been victims of social engineering. These people have spent days and months finding out the right time to attack you.Anyway, this courier boy then asked the family that they would need to pay Rs. 250 as the courier charges. He was even more convincing when he told them that since it was an authentic transaction, company policy was to accept payments via debit card. He then took out his POS machine (the machine at which you swipe your card). The couple gave their card and happily made the purchase. After a few hours they received messages of debits worth Rs.1,50,000.A simple POS machineThe rest is history. Just via the message, I am unable to confirm if it is true or not. But the modus operandi of hacking people when they are swiping cards is definitely plausible. The original POS machine is topped up with an additional plastic cover that is called a skimmer. It has memory of its own and stores card details when you swipe at them. POS skimmers have been around for a long time and have been used at common places like petrol pumps, grocery stores and now via delivery services that deliver your Myntra, Flipkart and Amazon COD orders. APOS skimmers have been around for a long time and have been used at common places like petrol pumps, grocery stores and now via delivery services that deliver your Myntra, Flipkart and Amazon COD orders. A POS skimmer is a device that grabs your information (about your card) as you swipe at a store. This information can then be copied on to duplicate cards and used for transactions. This is even more important right now because of COD orders being processed via debit cards in India. You can also watch this video.Nothing in this world except common sense is going to save you. Here are a few tips that will definitely help you in the coming times:Do away with just magnetic stripe cards, chip based cards have a different technology of being used at POS machines.At the POS machine, you should NEVER give your card to anyone. You have the right to swipe your card on your own.You can either ask for the machine to be brought to you or you may go to the machine yourself.Inspecting any device before swiping your card is mandatory now after you read this post.Inspection means you can use your hand to try to softly open the top of the machine. In most of the cases where there is a skimmer there, it will come off.These kind of frauds are also happening at ATM machines but that is a topic for another post and we will deal with it another time.Do leave a comment and Share! "

    "headline": "Pornography Rules in India",
    "data": "(इस आर्टिकल को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें)This is another one of those posts which I am writing because of a heavy amount of search queries. “Pornography rules in India”, are there any? If you ask a straightforward question, the answer is no. The reason so many people (not just youngsters) want an answer to this question is because they are consuming pornography and are afraid whether watching porn is legal in India. To break the ice for yet another time, it is legal.Nobody in this country will put you in jail for watching porn unless you are doing it in public. Well, there is the whole public morality law in question. But generally speaking, it is definitely legal to watch porn in India until and unless it is child pornography. For that even if you are afraid about the Pornography rules, you are as sick as this gets. No vigilante groups, hackers, state bodies etc. anywhere in the world support the idea of child pornography. The very fact that child pornography exists is a failure of the entire ecosystem of morals, internet, values and the law. Even in USA and UK  where possession of pornography has never been an offence, Child Pornography is condemned and is a penal offence.That said, coming back to the topic of Pornography rules in India, it is apt to mention some things here. Though watching porn is legal yet making someone else watch it is a crime punishable by up to 5 years of imprisonment. Making someone else watch it might sound a little loose. Trust me when I say this, there are several cases where guys have often forced upon girls to watch porn. It has been while they have been in relationships or just friends as well. Within this ambit of “making someone watch” as I put it, the legal words are publishing, transmitting or causing any of the two. This means that if you publish anything containing a sexually explicit act, even if it is an image, you are liable for the same punishment. The same goes for transmitting in private messages, Facebook Chats, WhatsApp messages etc.Section 67, 67A, and 67B of the Information Technology Act, 2000 are the relevant provisions. Section 67 talks about punishment for publication or transmission of obscene material in electronic form. Though the definition of obscenity is mostly vague in the Indian context, we have tried to trace the developments here. It prescribes imprisonment up to three years or fine up to ₹5 lakh or both on first conviction. As for second and subsequent convictions, imprisonment up to five years and fine up to ₹10 lakh have been prescribed.Section 67A criminalises the publication or transmission of any material depicting sexually explicit act or conduct in electronic form. Imprisonment up to five years or fine up to ₹10 lakh or both are prescribed in this section. It also incorporates situations when a person or group of person forces or influences another person to publish or transmit such content over the Internet. For second and subsequent convictions, the extent of fine remains the same; however, imprisonment up to seven years may be prescribed.Section 67B focusses on child pornography and it prescribes for imprisonment up to five years or fine up to ₹10 lakh or both on first conviction. Just like Section 67A, the extent of fine on second and subsequent convictions remain same, but imprisonment up to seven years may be prescribed. This section mentions various acts that can be considered as an offence under its ambit:Publication or transmission of material depicting children in sexually explicit conduct or act, or forcing/influencing the sameCreating text or images showing child pornographyCollecting, searching, browsing, downloading, promoting, advertising, distributing, or exchanging any material showing child pornography in electronic formFacilitating abuse of children onlineEnticing or inducing children to an online relationship with other children for sexually explicit actsRecording sexually explicit act with childrenThere is definitely a law against it. As for this post, we will keep it to pornography. If you send someone a picture that depicts some sort of sexual act, you are liable for punishment. For anything else obscene, I will write another post.If you go by the definition of law, unless a text is for the public good of creating awareness, sex education etc., “sex stories” though textual will still fall under the ambit of being called pornography and will be tried the same way. So no, sex stories are also within the ambit of the law which will criminalize you for publishing or transmitting. Consumption, however, is legal. So if sex stories are legal in the US and you read them here, it is totally legal.Outside India is outside India’s jurisdiction in the practical sense. If pornography is legalized in the country where it is hosted, India cannot force upon the website to stop functioning. Alternatively, as we have seen, the Government or the Judiciary might ban it in India, if it is thought to be unacceptable. You can read more about this here. Watching porn at home is not illegal.Saving it on your personal laptop, smartphone, storage media is also not illegal.Distribution/Sale/Showcasing/Publishing/Sending on private messages etc. is illegal.Sending porn videos/images/texts or anything depicting sexually explicit acts (unless educational) to someone is also illegal.Sex stories are also sexually explicit content.Whether ISPs are causing transmission of such porn into the country is a grey area but practically they will not be held responsible except for child pornography.Child Pornography, in any sense, watching, saving, sharing etc. is totally illegal.You can read more on this from our friends at Cyber Cops here: Is Watching Porn a Crime in India 2020"

    "data": "With Governments notification dated 2nd January 2016 looks like India’s long struggle of proving digital evidence in court will soon come to an end. The notice declares that under Section 79A of IT Act, 2008 which empowers Central Government to appoint an Examiner of electronic evidence, India is soon to get one.As mandated by virtue of Sec. 79A of ITA, 2008, A Government department, body or association ONLY can be the Examiner of electronic evidence. For the same, the department longing to be a certified examiner is expected to fill the application under Annexure II and send to MeitY. The application would undergo a strict 3 stage assessment. The first stage comprises of an offline assessment of the application and creating a panel of experts for evaluating the same. The second stage would be an onsite evaluation, where the labs would be evaluated for standards, technique, tools manpower etc. The third and final round would be an overall evaluation post which MeitY can give an assent to the department and grant license. As easy as it may sound, the task of getting an approval would not be a cake walk. The labs and security information techniques used for evaluation of electronic evidence should be as per international standards. Presently only a few labs across the nation have such facilities.  Electronic evidence is a secondary evidence as per Indian evidence act, meaning it does not have the same persuasive value. Till date, any electronic evidence which is brought forth in the court of law goes to a forensic lab for expert opinion only after the consent of the court. This is due to the sensitive nature of the evidence. Many at this point would argue, If forensic lab already exists, what is the need to have a separate department for examining electronic evidence.?  However post notification, a legal entity can suo moto approach the Examiner of Electronic evidence to verify the authenticity of the evidence. The evidence would still be submitted under Section 65B of Indian Evidence Act before the court but this would speed up the whole process immensely. Delay in proceedings is one of the major reason for layback in cases of cyber crime. Today, digital evidence are actively brought forth in traditional crime cases as well. Therefore it is of utmost importance to have a system for acceptance of digital evidence after expeditiously proving its veracity.The decision might have a landmark impact on Indian cyber scenario subject to the effect of implementation of the notice. Reference:http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/india-to-finally-get-electronic-evidence-authenticators/articleshow/56370238.cms?from=mdrhttp://www.naavi.org/wp/?p=5138 "

    "data": "You would be shocked to know that Russia requested Apple and Google to remove the LinkedIn app from their respective app stores. As reported by The New York Times a few months ago, a Russian court had ordered to block the networking portal. This was owing to the fact that LinkedIn was breaching the Russian Data Protection rules. The lawmakers in Russia only recently formed these new rules. They state that in case any company is trying to store personal details about a Russian user, they must store it on servers based within the country.It is imperative to note here that such a provision is non-existent in India. While some would argue that it really wouldn’t matter, I would like to bring in my friends from the Law Enforcement and Information Security. Most of the experts and the courts are shorthanded by the disability to obtain data (evidence) for prosecuting criminals. It is because the servers that store this data lie outside the country. Yes, my lawyer friends! There is a way to get that data. But in many cases, the wait goes on and on, and in cases, it goes on endless.Russia Blocks LinkedInThe kind of impact that this can have on LinkedIn is just foreseeable. They will loose revenue, but the Russian market will also suffer. Today, a lot of people transact and interact over LinkedIn and I am sure Russians would not be an exception. Such a ban would hamper their businesses as well.Though something like this is bold and there is a lot of criticism that Russia is getting for this move yet if we look at it broadly, it can prove to be of some good to a country like India where the conviction rate for Cyber crime is pretty low. If servers of these service providers and intermediaries are located in India, the whole process of filing for letters rogatory can be done away with. Instead a normal notice from the court would suffice to produce data. Not that I say it could be revolutionary but it will definitely ease pressure off the law enforcement and judiciary to solve these cases. So, It is not just for protection of privacy of users and other things. In order to make justice more plausible such steps are needed from time to time.This is that one coin which has both sides unlike many other metaphorical references about the Cyber Space. The unending debate about the open internet and freedom of service providers and the users. There are the good things and the bad as well. Openness is good, great in fact. I am a supporter but what can we afford at the cost of so many cases unsolved for the want to evidence to prosecute criminals? "

    "headline": "Who is responsible for an Internet Banking fraud?",
    "data": "An interesting question. Well, one that I’ve been asked several times about Internet Banking. However, I’ve never had a simple reply. Generally speaking, “who is responsible” for anything is a question that a judicial body answers. Advocates, Academicians, and Experts have opinions. We have seen cases wherein lakhs of rupees have been transferred from one bank account to another with the victim pondering over this one question, “Who is responsible for an Internet Banking fraud?”This position was recently cleared by the IT Adjudicator of Gujarat, Dhananjay Dwivedi, IAS while adjudicating in an important case of Shri Parimal Manharlal Patel v. The Brach Manager, Dena Bank & Ors.Consider this situation:Somebody gets to know your Internet Banking Username and Password. (This could be because you logged in on an insecure or public WiFi, your device has been compromised via a malware/keylogger etc. or if somebody was a very good social engineer, meaning your password was extremely guessable.)They get a duplicate SIM card made. It is very easy and is being done across the entire country on a very large scale.They log into your Internet Banking account and initiate a transfer request. Upon this, the OTP that would otherwise be sent to you would be received by the criminal and your SIM would be deactivated.Before you realize, your bank account would be emptied.The Adjudicator, in this case, held that the bank had adopted necessary safety measures and also cooperated with the police during the investigation. But this was the position because the complainant could not bring out the reason as to why and how exactly the perpetrator knew the login credentials of the victim. I believe, that would be true in all the cases. Generally, the victim will never be able to know how he lost his credentials because of the fact that probably he is not technically sound enough to understand it.Anyhow, in this case, the money was actually still sitting in the bank accounts that it was transferred to. The accounts were seized and the money was returned to the victim. Idea Cellular, the company that gave away a duplicate SIM to the criminal was however held as negligent and liable for breaching a crucial chain in the Internet Banking Security process. It was ordered to pay compensation to the victim along with the adjudication fee as fine. The Adjudicator in a proactive step also wrote in his order that since Internet Banking frauds are on the rise, customers should be aware of how to get their money back. They get involved in criminal actions and do not look at the civil remedy of adjudication that they have. We highly appreciate this fact being acknowledged by the Adjudicator here. We have already discussed this matter earlier here.Who is responsible for an Internet banking fraud?In this regard, it becomes imperative to share a provision of the Code of Bank’s Commitment to Customers. Provision 8.17 mentions that the maximum liability of a customer in case of an unauthorized transaction shall be a maximum of INR 10,000. This means that only in case the customer is committing the fraud himself, is he liable to not receive the money. In all other cases, for all purposes, if this code is followed, the banks shall be liable for any unauthorized transaction. This is just an interpretation of how things can be. Any legal arguments are welcome."

    "headline": "Download Safe and avoid Ransomware",
    "data": "The topic that I’m writing about today is pretty basic yet the reason for most of the incidents that happen online. “Download Safe?”, People often ask me (mock, even at times) that how can you “safely download”. There’s this wide array of posters saying download safe, stay safe. But what, really? The most you’ve got to do is type in what you want on a search engine and just get the file already. APKs for Android Games, EXEs for Windows Software (I know you are probably using IDM), .DMGs for MACs and what not. There are multiple ways we adopt to download content for free, which is otherwise, paid. Well, you do get stuff for free you think, but is it really?I’m going to briefly focus on ransomware here because it is one of the biggest concern of the modern day corporate. Ransomware is a particular type of contaminant which stays undetected to most of the anti-virus systems in place. It focuses on not letting you use your device and then holding this for ransom. It achieves this either through encrypting your drives or blocking you out of even accessing your device. Our friends at Kaspersky have dealt with ransomware in detail here. And the biggest source of ransomware is non-trusted downloading.Even if you evade the enclosure of ransomware, there is a whole set of spyware that can sit on your device just through the practice of “unsafe downloading”. Well, most of it has seen major place among us because of the want of free software, music, movies and what not. This makes the Indian internet users very vulnerable to being conned. And with the whole cashless drive coming into the picture, the number of internet and smartphone users are going to rise. Everybody is going to own a smartphone, have a data plan and then be vulnerable at the end because of the lack of awareness. That is one reason why, even if you feel that all of this is pretty basic, you need to closely monitor how you interact with services online and if you are in the safety area, help those who are not.Not really, you know. There can be so many things that add up to that perfect set of things that you need to do, the rules that you need to follow. And that, just in order to escape the boundary of vulnerability. One way of being vulnerable is being demonstrated in the Video here. Yes, this is me!The video deliberates about the way some hackers fool you into downloading an application and causing you to compromise your security. If you are an Android user, I can pretty much bet on this fact that you’ve encountered this problem on your device more than often. It could have been while you were trying to download that Coldplay song or finding a website to stream the latest Sherlock episode (Well, I know it’s due in 2017). Once you get an apk file for the app that you want, you will definitely not bother reading the permissions it asks for. You go on to installing an app and only later realizing that it wasn’t what you wanted.  Some apps, believe me, are on your smartphone and reading your location, messages, call logs and so much more 24×7. Even if you delete the app after you realize, it could be pretty late because it has already captured all that data it needed.No! There are so many talented security researchers in the business who keep monitoring these trends every day. They’ve found many instances of malicious apps being sold on the Play Store as well. The only full proof way that I personally use is the “Why the hell test?”. Strange, right?Don’t worry, it is not a security standard. Just something that I made up. If I’m trying to download an app to listen to music, “Why the hell should it ask to access my messages?”. This is the decision you take at the time of installing the application and at times when the app asks for access to certain services post install as well. That precisely was the test. If an application fails the test, discard it, do not install!When the whole Section 66A scrapping was applauded by most of the Internet users in India, it was ironical at some level, frankly. Though freedom of speech is what we contest for throughout the year but our right to privacy, we infringe on our own. Anyhow, through this post, I would urge all the readers to take this safe download approach for applications on your devices and more importantly, if you already know or have become aware through this, spread the word. Don’t share this post if you don’t like it but take its essence and tell the newcomers into this space. "

    "headline": "Stop using SMS OTP: Security is your responsibility",
    "data": "We have written multiple articles about 2FA (Two factor authentication). I am happy to share that a lot of people have opted for 2FA on their accounts after reading our posts and talking to us. Either via our WhatsApp helpline, Facebook Page or on Direct Messages to our team members. If you haven’t read about 2FA and Google Authenticator yet, read this first. The line of difference now is between SMS OTP and app based OTP.OTP is a technology that makes use of mathematical algorithms to generate a secure code that is usable only once and is valid for a fixed time duration. Banks, Social Media services, Email providers etc. use this technology to verify your login. Calling it Two Factor means that in addition to your password, this OTP acts like the second layer that verifies it is actually you. SMS OTP is when this OTP arrives via text message on your device and is app based when an application on your smartphone generates it.Every alternate day, there is a pathetic case in the nation where a fake SIM card is involved/used as a tool to commit a crime. The reason is improper KYC (Know your customer) procedure and misuse of SMS OTP. I am sure most of you have got your prepaid SIM card by just giving the retailer a copy of your ID proof and a few photographs. Most of you haven’t even seen the form that is to be filled and very few have actually even signed it. Yes, that is right. It is a cakewalk today to get anyone’s duplicate SIM card issued and misuse it to any effect. Let us assume you fall victim to some fraud. All you are left with is curses, abuses and blames at your telecom, bank, Social Media service etc. Yes, security is their duty as well.But since it is your personal data, money and information that we are talking about, is it going to harm you too much to be a little proactive and take the liability upon yourself to stay safe?It might sound astonishing to get hacked and defrauded but it is a nightmare for those who really undergo this. Just a few days ago, I was reading a great article about levels of personal security. It wonderfully explained how with a few simple implementations in your digital life, you can curb the chances of getting hacked up to 80%. Two factor authentication is one of the parameters. If you have Two Factor Authentication enabled for your bank account transactions and your OTPs arrive via SMS (SMS OTP), it’s time to upgrade. Almost all major banks today have their own apps now to generate the OTP with/without an internet connection. Major Social Media services too offer you this feature and it takes a few seconds to get this on. Today, most of your digital life involves online banking and social media.App based OTP thus puts SMS OTP out of the picture and makes it only device dependent. This makes it difficult for a hacker to gain access to your account through SIM duplication/reading SMS etc. Hence, strengthening your personal security. Here are links to a few applications. In case of any doubt or clarification, We’d love to hear from you!ICICI BankSBI BankGoogle Authenticator – For all other accounts including Facebook, Gmail, Outlook etc.Note: This post is a part of a series that we are going to launch about personal cyber security. We will be publishing individual articles about things you can do to strengthen your personal security ecosystem.Stop SMS OTP"

    "headline": "Shocking: Cyber crime exceeds traditional crime in UK",
    "data": "The power of Internet and Digital Media we all believe in, but isn’t it too early? I feel so! The Internet is young and its real potential is yet to be tapped. But in these few years of use, Cyber Crime has exceeded the traditional crime in the UK. We are not lagging behind in real numbers. But the problem is that most of the Cyber Crime in the country goes unaccounted for.The National Crime Agency of UK has warned in its report published on July 7, 2016, of the total incidents of cyber crime in the country. You might be shocked to know that the figure is astonishing. Roughly 53% of the crime in the UK is now Computed Enabled or Computer Misuse. “The ONS estimated that there were 2.46 million cyber incidents and 2.11 million victims of cyber crime in the U.K. in 2015,” the report’s authors wrote. “These figures highlight the clear shortfall in established reporting, with only 16,349 cyber-dependent and approximately 700,000 cyber-enabled incidents reported to Action Fraud over the same period.”The report forecasts international crime groups and organised crime as the biggest threat to the UK. This makes sense you know because these people are generally not much aware about technology or its use. But the Internet has created a marketplace where trading is easy as never before. As is seen and forecasted by many information security evangelists, Ransomware is the next big thing! The report also goes on to talk about a targeted attack on a company where user data was stolen. And ransom was then demanded to return the data. These attacks also take various technical shapes where users are locked out of devices and then ransom is demanded. Another threat is the Internet of Things. The amount of data being generated is increasing already. When we reach a stage where the entire Internet using population uses smart devices, there will be exhaustion. So, security needs to be the prime concern in the minds of developers and technologists now. The report also goes on to talk about the RAMNIT botnet and DRIDEX malware.This is one major reason the world needs more Cyber Security specialists and not script kiddies and more Cyber Lawyers and policy makers. However free you may feel the Internet is, but everything ultimately is governed by the Law and in order to combat Cyber Crime and Cyber aided Crime, there needs to be an efficient level of policymaking. In India right now especially, there is an urgent need for a better Cyber legislation."

    "headline": "Hummingbad Malware: Have you heard of it?",
    "data": "According to the Kaspersky labs, there are 315,000 new viruses being created daily. Adding to this figure, in February this year, researchers from CheckPoint software technologies identified a new malware and named it as the Hummingbad Malware. It is an adware, that establishes a persistent rootkit on android devices, generates fraudulent ad revenue and installs additional fraudulent apps. A persistent rootkit in simple terms would be an exclusive access to your device, meaning, the attacker can through this malware do anything, literally with your device. A rootkit can cause random image clicks or live front cam feed and even tweaking your smartphone’s processor settings.According to CheckPoint, a market leader in security products, around 10 million devices are using such malicious apps loaded with the Hummingbad Malware. Victims are spread worldwide, with China (1,606,384) and India (1,352,772) taking the lead. The infection largely depends on the android version. KitKat(50%) is the most infected, followed by JellyBean(40%), Lollipop(7%), Ice Cream Sandwich (2%) and Marshmallow(1%).\nThe Chinese company who built the Hummingbad Malware is estimated to make $30,000 every month out of it. Each click gives the company $0.00125. The apps display more than 20 million advertisements per day while HummingBad installs more than 50,000 fraudulent apps per day increasing their revenue every day.Pictures: CheckPoint’s report on HummingbadThe fact that attackers can install an app onto your device without your knowledge would definitely freak out a lot of you, but that is not all. They can get complete control of your device and access anything like images, contacts, messages, camera snaps and much more.If you don’t want this to happen to you, here is what you can do to begin with.-Stop downloading apps from untrusted sources, download only if the app is available on the Play Store.-Update your device regularly and perhaps install an antivirus from a trusted source and not the free versions, easily available online. Avast Mobile security and Kaspersky antivirus are a few good options.-Scan your device. If you find something suspicious, go for a factory reset. Painful? Of course, but staying protected is more important. However, it cannot protect you from persistent rootkits.\nSpecial thanks to Mr. Vatsal Jain, for sending his post to us. I hope you enjoy reading it as much as we enjoy sharing it."

    "headline": "Stopping children from viewing pornography",
    "data": "In one of our earlier posts, we have talked about viewing pornography and its legality in India. Statistically, In India, about 70% of the internet traffic comes from viewing pornography. Which means that a major chunk of the Indian population consumes pornographic content on regular basis. Surveys have also suggested that viewing pornography is a habit mostly carried out through mobile phones.The recent Digital Economy Bill has introduced a concept called Age Verification (AV) for users viewing pornography in the country. The law is aimed at introducing Age Verification for all websites and apps containing pornographic content. In order to facilitate this, the Government will team up with service providers, website owners and payment merchants as well. The easy availability of pornography is constantly changing the way children and young people understand healthy relationships, sex, and consent. While it is true that every child has a right to develop at their own pace, it is sensible to think that exposing children to pornography at a young age can be very harmful. The United Kingdom already leads the world in online child protection. During the consultation process, all nodal agencies and the public welcomed this step.It might also shock you, that the average time spent by a child per day on the internet has surpassed TV in the last 10 years (Ofcom). As internet users, we are all aware that how easy it is to get exposed to the pornographic content. Even if a child begins to download a song, he can end up on a pornographic website or an advertisement that is graphic. Indeed a great step has been taken by the UK Government. But what needs to be done in India is first, acknowledging the fact that pornography can be legal. We have only inferred from the laws that viewing pornography is legal, and selling/distributing isn’t. However, there is a huge amount of clarity needed and after that perhaps, even we can consider implementing smart technologies to restrict content and not a total ban.Most porn sites are based overseas, how will you enforce this law against these sites/companies? The aim of our policy is to capture all sites, both foreign and domestic with a proportionate regulatory approach. We will focus on commercial providers of pornography. And ensure that the new legal requirement, and regulatory framework underpinning it, capture these.What is the government doing to address the availability of “free” pornography sites? It is absolutely our intention to capture all commercial sites that provide porn, whether this is paid for directly, or ‘free’ sites that are used as a ‘shop window’ for paid services.Technology will always stay one step ahead of legislation, how will government future-proof this policy? Our drafting will allow for flexibility and we will continue to work closely with industry to monitor progress and latest technological developments to ensure key growth areas such as “apps” are covered under the scope."

    "headline": "Cyber Bullying is real, but here is what you can do",
    "data": "Cyber Bullying is a plague contaminating the entire Indian Social Media space rapidly. School students, Adults, Professionals and even the elderly have been a victim of Cyber Bullying. Sona Mohapatra, a renowned musician in the Indian music fraternity was publicly Cyber Bullied by fans of the actor, Salman Khan for days, after her tweet  about his latest controversy went viral. Personally, I had been following the Cyber Bullying attacks on her through her Facebook and Twitter feed, post by post to find out the depth of the enmity that people hold.Women thrashed,people run over,wild life massacred & yet #hero of the nation.'Unfair'.India full of such supporters pic.twitter.com/qrNkBZCWT1— #SonaLIVE (@sonamohapatra) June 21, 2016The millionth such message from your followers & digital army, @BeingSalmanKhan .Sure  your feeling like a true hero pic.twitter.com/oNT4Se6nQ0— #SonaLIVE (@sonamohapatra) June 24, 2016What has happened ever since this tweet can be terrifying and devastating at the same time for anyone, not just a woman. But the way Sona Mohapatra has handled her Cyber Bullies is what the youth of this country needs to adopt. What generally kids and young boys and girls do, is that they give in. They would delete their Social Media Profile, try to block the Cyber Bully’s account and hide in a room without any mention of it to their family. She faced the entire situation openly and kept herself calm throughout. This is what you need to do if you are being Cyber Bullied, keep your head straight, face it, tell your parents or colleagues and DO NOT delete your social media accounts or try to hide online.We will be dealing with Cyber Bullying and related laws in a later post. For now, what you need to know is that after seeing the trolls and messages targeted at Sona Mohapatra, Maneka Gandhi, the Women and Child Development Minister has publically appealed to all the victims of Cyber Bullying to directly write to her at gandhim@nic.in.If you are a victim or Cyber Bullying, now you can directly write to her and first hand, get the content removed. Otherwise, you can also report to your nearest Police Station, get an FIR done with the relevant provisions of law which we will be dealing with separately for your awareness."

    "headline": "Digital India Myths: OTP",
    "data": "OTP or One Time Password is an additional authentication factor required in online services these days. To complete a transaction or to login on some service, an OTP is sent via SMS to the account owner. The user verifies his identity by filling the One Time Password.OTP was earlier believed to be secure as being a part of multi-factor authentication system. This however, was one of the biggest misconceptions. Studies showed that OTP would avoid phishing like attacks but opened more avenues for the attackers.The basic idea behind OTP was that every account is connected with a particular mobile number. The mobile numbers are believed to be authentic since they are issued based on Governmental ID proofs. It is also assumed that the SIM card stays with the owner of the mobile phone. These assumptions have been confirmed as myths today. There are two major realities which overrule this.First, SMS OTP would be secure only if the privacy of SMS messages are maintained which heavily relies on security of cellular networks. Second, in recent times several attacks have been recorded against GSM networks which clearly show that SMS messages are not at all confidential. OTP is generated by the service provider and sent to the mobile network operator which further sends it to the user’s mobile phone.There are several modus operandi used by criminals against SMS OTP, which magnify the loophole in the entire process. Let us suppose, there’s a criminal who has knowledge of your banking credentials. With the help of these details, he logs in and initiates the process of transaction. An OTP is sent to you by the bank. One most common occurrence is where the attacker creates a fake ID by using the heap of information you provide online and gets a duplicate SIM issued. Here you can also think of the calls you get claiming that your debit card is going to expire. And the rest becomes history.Following are certain attacks against which you should secure yourself to prevent the criminal from completing the transaction.Don’t let anybody physically access your phone in your absence. We do not realize but this may actually be very dangerous.As already mentioned, the authentication service providers wholly rely on mobile network operators. By using certain tools, an attacker can intercept mobile communication and get the access. It is thus clear that there is no security.Next, there are certain mobile phone trojans that are specially designed to intercept SMS OTPs. Most mobile operating systems provide access to received SMS messages to applications after asking you the simple “Do you agree to the T&C?” question. They can also be provided access to take part in delivery process of SMS messages. In such case, trojan can receive, alter, delete and forward SMS messages without your knowledge. Some smartphone Operating Systems protect SMS messages through their permission system. But unfortunately, being unaware, we grant permission to insecure applications.OTP, despite being a pretty user friendly method cannot be considered a good layer of security. Is there a way we can increase security of OTP or is second layer of security a vague concept ? Get answers to these questions in our upcoming post.Special thanks to Sukhmani Kaur who is the author of this post."

    "headline": "How to Check if your Child is being Cyber Bullied?",
    "data": "The use of Internet among people is increasing day by day specially, the younger generation. They are using it for just about everything (studying, shopping, banking, social interaction, finding jobs, earning money) but few use it for committing cyber crime too. Cyber bullying is one of those crimes.The use of electronic communication to bully a person, typically by sending messages of an intimidating or threatening nature. Cyber bullying can be committed through digital messages, email, images, instant messaging, web site publications, chat rooms or SMS, MMS send to a PDA or phone. Cyber bullying includes Harassment, Denigration, Flaming, Impersonation, Trickery, Stalking, or other forms of victimization.Similar to customary bullying, Cyber bullying involves aggression, use of power, and repeated false action. Cyber bullying is different from customary bullying as in:Anonymity: In school, as much cruel the bully is, he or she can be identified and avoided. But a cyber-bully most of the times is anonymous and is difficult to figure out which causes a great deal of stress to the victim.Accessibility: Traditional bullying can happen only when the victim is accessible to the bully. Whereas cyber bullying can wreak havoc any time of the day or night.Fears: Fear of punishment from their tormentors and fear that their privilege to access phone or computer will be taken away. These are two reasons why the victim does not report the case.Bystanders: Bystanders, generally referred as witnesses, are other nearby people enjoying the act of bullying. In traditional bullying, they are limited in number whereas this number can cross millions in case of cyber bullying. Here they may receive and forward emails, view web pages, forward images sent to cellular phones, etc.Disinhibition: The anonymity gives tormentor to indulge in misbehavior that they might not do face-to-face.Bullying in either mode (online or offline) causes similar grievous emotional effects. However a torn clothing or bruise are not expected in cyber bullying. But in most of the cases if a child is being cyber bullied then he or she experiences traditional bullying at school also.Watch out following behavior of a child:Appears sad, moody, or anxious, clingy, aggressive or depressedBeing nervous, losing confidence or becoming distressed or withdrawnAvoids school or group gatheringsShows disinterest or withdraws from social interaction.Being emotionally upset after viewing message or using phone or computerExperiences a drop in academic performanceEating disorders or change in eating habitsProblem in sleepingDeleting online accountsAsking how to block othersNightmaresIndulge in drugs, alcohol or other self-harming actsThoughts about suicide.Unfortunately, Section 66A of the Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008, which used to deal with punishment for sending offensive messages through communication service, has been struck off by the Supreme Court last year in the case of Shreya Singhal v Union of India. It was the one crucial law that touched Cyber bullying. However, Section 354D of the Indian Penal Code (Amendment) Act 2013 talks about Cyber Stalking which is a type  of Cyber bullying. However it is available to only female victims.Firstly, offer some comfort and support to your child. Remind your child that (s)he isn’t alone; lot of people get bullied at some point. Tell the child that it is not his/her culpability. Ask your child not to respond any further to cyberbullying as it will make the situation worse. Reassure him that you will figure out what to do about it.Now report the problem, tell someone at school about the incident. Many schools have protocols for dealing with bullies. Otherwise, lodge a FIR regarding the same.Do not delete the threatening messages, conversations, pictures, or texts, as these are used as evidence against bully. If possible take the screenshot of the display, it captures the date and time of communication.Block the bullyLimit access to technologyKnow your kids’ online worldLearn about ways to stay safe onlineThe usage of internet has become quite common in today’s era and therefore it is almost impossible to detach ourself from this morally bad crime. In order to get over this crime, the above mentioned solution can be availed of, which can be of great help. The easiest way to stay safe from cyber bully is to be aware about the rapidly changing technology.Click here to check a thorough guide on cyber bullying compiled by our friends at Your Gear Deconstructed.Read My Cyber Crime Stories for more cases of cyber bullying.References:(1) Oxford Dictionary(2) https://www.hazelden.org/web/public/rmmay10_bullying.page(3) http://kidshealth.org/enm/parents/cyberbullying.htmlNote: This post is on behalf of Ravi Kant."

    "headline": "Data Classification: The Remedy to Data Breaches",
    "data": "Millions are spent upon setting up security tools like sandboxes and endpoint tools, but what many companies neglect is a proper classification of how the data stored within company’s databases is managed, and who has the rights to access these databases within the company. Most of the breaches happen due to poor enforcement of policies and other human errors.image source: http://www.darkreading.com Here are some of the data classification tips that must be followed:Define a set policy for classifying data: This is the first and most important step, policy making. For this, the best practice is to form a questionnaire about how the data is stored, who can access the classified data, till when will the company store its data, etc. By asking these questions, the company will start getting a handle on its data issues. The aim is to shrink the amount of data the company stores and reduce the number of people who can access it, reducing liability as well as the potential that data will leak out of the company because it has not set usage policies. Understand Regulatory Issues of Your Industry: Every industry has certain regulations made for them. The goal here is to understand those regulations and amend the company policies in such a way that these regulations don’t cause any hindrance in making the classification. Implement Tools To Minimize Risks: Human errors can be hugely reduced by implementing tools that get this job of classifying data done. Companies like Identity Finder, Bolden James, and Veritas Technology have developed various tools. The point of any of these tools is to have them help you identify the data you no longer need and keep only the data that’s valuable to the company. Deploy Continuous Monitoring: Data kept in databases along with the tools must be monitored from time to time. Only deploying the tools for classifying your data might not help, it needs continuous checking and updation. Technology changes very frequently, so does the breachable space, thus it is very important to use the latest versions of these tools. Consider an Appropriate Deployment Model: There are 3 kinds of models, the one in which data is centralized, the cloud deployment model, and hybrid model. It is always advised to use the hybrid one, storing the confidential and classified data at the center, and rest general-purpose information in cloud servers which can be accessed remotely.image source: www.cloudhostworks.com"

    "headline": "Panama Papers breach: The result of bad security practices?",
    "data": "The names of Amitabh Bachchan, Aishwarya Rai Bachchan and a few other Indians coming up in the news suddenly, Iceland’s Prime Minister Sigmundur Davíð Gunnlaugsson taking temporary leave from office, etc. all are linked with Panama based law-firm Mossack Fonseca. This sudden upcoming of names from across the world is a result of so-called breach of “Panama Papers”, a set of more than 11 million documents leaked from the said firm. News articles related to the incident have been doing rounds in newspapers and social media since last 4-5 days. It it still unknown that who is the person behind this and how he/she managed to get hold of documents. The leaked documents are emails, PDFs, photos and excerpts of the firm’s internal database covering a period from 1970 to 2016. In total, 2.6 TBs of data has been stolen from the firm.This amount of data could not have been ex-filtrated in a short amount of time and one can wonder how the firm failed to spot the data going out. Maybe this astonishment is misplaced, as bit by bit details of firm’s poor security practice are coming out.In a notification sent to its customers, Mossack Fonseca said that hack happened on their email server. But surely that is only a small part of the truth, because who keeps this much amount of data, that too very old on an email server?In an interview with Reuters, firm’s Founding Partner Ramon Fonseca said that the hack was not a inside job. They have a theory about how it happened and they are investigating it. He also added that the firm has made relevant complaints to the Attorney General’s office and a government institution is studying the issue. Also, the firm has hired expert consultants to fix the security of their systems and to prevent such an incident from happening again. It seems that the firm did an extremely poor job at securing the documents in the first place and this is something its customers are unlikely to forget. Apparently, there are many areas where the hacker could have exploited.Forbes has reported that the firm’s website ran a 3-month old version of WordPress and its customer portal most likely ran a 3-year old version of Drupal. That’s a lot of unfixed vulnerabilities that would have been easily exploited.WP Tavern’s Sarah Gooding said that the firm ran its unencrypted emails through an outdated 2009 version of Microsoft’s Outlook Web Access. Outdated open-source software running the front-end of the firm’s websites is also suspected to have provided a vector for the compromise. She further added that the firm’s main is site is loading a number of outdated scripts and plugins.Also, it’s been in the news that the hacker offered the ex-filtrated documents to a Süddeutsche Zeitung (SZ) journalist back in January 2015 and the firm noticed that they have been breached only now. Security, clearly has not been the firm’s priority.According to Dr Daniel Dresner, a lecturer in cyber security at Manchester University, that’s not such a surprise as it should be. He told Wired that law firms often have a lax approach to security. He added,”There is always a feeling in the legal fraternity that whatever happens they’ll be able to get off the wrap because they’re clever legal people. People are now starting to realize that legal companies are a great target. When you think about the size of stuff that they’re negotiating, who they’re negotiating for and the number of different parties involved, the motivation is there for people who want a bit of insider information”#PanamaPapers breach: The result of bad #security practices?: https://t.co/jCwEpFCvAf#MossackFonseca #Panama #datatheft #lawfirm #taxhaven— The Cyber Blog India (@incyberblog) April 12, 2016\nConsidering the previous major leaks: Wikileaks Cablegate at 1.7 GB, Ashley Madison at 30 GB, and Sony Pictures at 230 GB, the Panama Papers breach of 2.6 TBs of data, the largest of all time, is certainly an eyebrow-raiser. "

    "headline": "Money Fraudulently taken from Bank Account- What to do?",
    "data": "Statistically, plastic money frauds in India have seen troubling growth in the last decade. Headlines reporting fraudulent money withdrawals from ATM machines are an almost regular occurrence. On our helpline and from people inquisitive about the cyber law, we get to hear this question a lot.While there is no defined legal recourse for this particular situation, there are a certain set of cases that have laid a little foundation for people to take action. First of all, we believe that most of the credit/debit card frauds happen due to lack of user awareness and use of obsolete technologies by the banks. The best thing to do first hand is to be aware while using plastic money online or offline for any type of transactions. The answer to “How to be aware?” is available in the hundreds of posts available on this website.There are basically two actions that you may take:Criminal Action: Using Sections 66C, 66D of the IT Act, 2000 and Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code, you can pursue a criminal action in order to get the law enforcement to find out the criminal. Often we have seen that this recourse doesn’t get a user’s money back or catch the criminal after all.Civil Action: This type of action can be pursued against your bank, the bank whose ATM money was withdrawn at or payment gateways, depending on different situations. We will look at Civil Action in detail here because that is what can get you your money back. Your first authority to reach out is the bank to inform them of the fraud. You can claim to get compensated if there is a precedent like your case available already. After that, you could file a complaint with the IT Adjudicator of your state or the State Consumer Forum. Both these bodies have given out orders to the tune of compensating the customers. In cases like Vidyawanti v. State Bank of India, Sudahanshu Karna v. Punjab National Bank, Amit Kumar Ghosh v. ICICI Bank, State Bank India v. KK. Bhalla and many others, these authorities have ruled in favor of the customers compensating them with interest on the lost money.In 8.17.2 (p) of the Code of Bank’s Commitment to Customers, the extent of liability of a customer in case of a fraud on internet banking is stated. This is set at Rs. 10,000 which means that in any case of fraud over internet banking or plastic money being used online, the liability of the customer is only up to Rs. 10,000 and the rest is to be made good by the bank.In 8.17.4.1 (l) & (m), it has been stated again about the maximum liability in other transactions also i.e. for any loss that occurs before you notify your bank of a fraudulent transaction, the customer is only liable up to Rs. 10,000 with the exception that he is not committing fraud himself.RBI Guidelines device electronic banking frauds into two categories: one that requires ATM Card to be physically present, i.e. proximity transactions and one that does not require ATM Card physically i.e. Card Not Present (CNP) Transactions. For a better understanding of this, let’s call proximity transactions as ATM Frauds and CNP Transactions as Fraud Online Transactions.ATM Frauds will include the scenario when money gets withdrawn from your card without your knowledge. This is possible as your card has been cloned or skimmed and the fraudster has the duplicate copy of your card. In cases of ATM Frauds, the liability rests with the bank to credit the lost amount after the internal investigation. (We will be doing a post on this shortly).Fraud Online Transactions will include all such transactions when the caller represents himself as a bank officer, a government official, or from some lottery. Under this, incidents when the cardholder himself shares his sensitive card details under the impression that the caller is genuine, are covered. In Fraud Online Transactions, you should be proactive as the lost money can be traced with the help of payment service providers. In order to get help from us, please send all the relevant information about the incident at contact@cyberblogindia.in.

Chances are that he might even be a male and is just pretending to be a female.

Never transfer money into someone’s account just because you believe he might be the one.Photos. Search his photo on other social media platform or general search engine to ensure a model’s photo is not picked. Checkout if the photo is taken where and when he claims to be. A little investigation would do  no harm. If nothing suspicious, you will definitely pick up common stuff you can talk about.Recent facebook profile. A recently made facebook profile is an indication of a fake profile.

    "data": "Do you like to shop often with your credit cards? Or do you swipe your card at fuel stations? If the answer is “yes,” then you might be prone to credit card fraud.Credit card frauds are the scams committed using others’ card in a fraudulent way. It is the case where one’s card is used without their knowledge or authorization to purchase goods or services. This can also be considered a kind of identity theft.When we think of such frauds, the first thing that comes to our minds is stealing of the card, and then using it to purchase products. Well, such frauds account to less than 25% of the total number of frauds that take place today. Most of the frauds that happen today happen because of counterfeit card use. Criminals use the latest technology to skim out the data stored on the magnetic strip of your card, and then use it for online transactions. Another way it is done is by fetching out this information using fraudulent phishing e-mails.There are lots of ways in which this is done, and as the technology is advancing, even more new ways are being devised for carrying out such frauds.StealingThis has been the most well-known way since ages. But now, stealing of cards has reduced as new and more effective ways are out there. Stolen cards can only be used until the card holders block their cards. Thus, this is not considered as effective as other ways in which the holder might not even know that their information has been compromised.SkimmingSkimming is a way of stealing the information physically from the card. This can involve simple methods like clicking a picture of card to get the details, to complex methods like using a “skimmer”. Though skimmers haven’t yet reached India, they are very dangerous, as they skim out the details on magnetic tape in fractions of seconds right in front of your eyes.PhishingPhishing is the way in which fraudulent mails are sent to the card holders asking card details, either for any transaction, or any bank issues, or any other neatly forged reason. Such e-mails are sent in order to lure the card holder to share their information. Sometimes, this can be also done by making phone calls. This information is then used by the criminals to make online transactions (Card-Not-Present Transactions), where merchants rely on the information provided, and not the card itself. These were the most common ways in which such frauds are done. There are some more ways, like carding where the criminal enters information where real-time processing is done, and if this information is accepted, the information is considered correct. Application fraud is another such method, in which a fake bank account is opened in the name of others. Account takeover is a way in which the criminal fetches information about the card holder, and then uses it to masquerade in front of the issuer. All you need to know about #creditcard #frauds: https://t.co/aoe6b9GQt7#debitcard #ATM #phishing #skimming #RFID #identitytheft #India— The Cyber Blog India (@incyberblog) February 21, 2016There is always threat of credit card frauds.

    "headline": "Is it legal to share nude pictures over WhatsApp?",
    "data": "One of the major reasons the title says so is that a lot of readers want an answer to this question. Surveys, studies and researches have all suggested the same thing over and over again. It is that more than half of the young population of the country is involved in sharing nude pictures, semi-nude selfies and intimate moments over WhatsApp and other chat messaging applications. Is the reason cultural? No, statistics indicate that the same is the position in the west as well and other nations with a different culture than ours.We received a message on our WhatsApp helpline a few months ago from a girl who had sent certain objectionable pictures of hers to a boy who she was in love with. The interesting fact was that she was not even 16 and now being blackmailed to keep sending her pictures to him. The threat was that he would put the pictures online and distribute them among his and her friends as well. The sad thing is that this was one of the tens others that we receive every single day. So the best advice to give to you right away is not to indulge in sending any nude pictures or videos over chats and emails that can cause problems to you. If you are a couple getting married tomorrow or you have been married for ten years, it doesn’t matter because believe me when you read this, we have seen cases from both these fronts.No! Sharing nude pictures over WhatsApp can be illegal even if both the sender and the receiver consent. If there is to be a situation later where you need to defend yourself after sending such content to anyone, it can be problematic and I am writing about this from experience of a case. But don’t worry the police isn’t spying on you to see pictures you send and will not catch you for this offence. However if there is any criminal action later on, this act can be in question.  There is no specific law against it and neither is there enough precedent. But if we look closely at Section 67 of the IT Act, 2008, it goes on to say that if somebody publishes or transmits any material which is lascivious or appeals to the prurient interest or if its effect is such as to tend to deprave and corrupt persons who are likely, having regard to all relevant circumstances, to read, see or hear the matter contained or embodied in it, shall be punished on first conviction with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to three years.The gist is that, if you send something to someone or publish online that is lascivious (tending to excite lust, obscene etc.) it can land you up in prison for three years. Moreover, if it is a minor in question that you entice or induce (basically, get a person below 18 years of age to send you nude pictures or even get in a relationship with you), according to Section 67B the punishment can be for five years. But do not worry, the law also protects your privacy if someone tries to blackmail you or uploads your private pictures at any place or sends them to anyone. The law in India does not talk about sexting or revenge porn but these are the things that all of this relates to. If you need to know more about this, you can get in touch with us over Facebook or our WhatsApp Helpline.To read about How to take down Revenge Porn depicting you off the Internet, follow this link.\n\n"

    "data": "After life, the next big threat for an individual is to his money. We have seen ATM card skimming, plastic money forgery, large scale data breaches to pull out financial details, phishing and the modern (ish) phone call frauds to extract data as some of the tools to aid money laundering from users. Probably you are someone who is aware and wouldn’t give away his money just like that but let me tell you about this new type of fraud that is spreading like wildfire at least in the Northern part of India particularly smaller towns and villages.The medium of this fraud is not online yet the internet has some role to play in it. A regular office guy approaches a family in a village and tells them that he is representing Vodafone, Airtel, BSNL or some major telco. He then lures the family with an offer to set up a “3G tower” on their rooftop and explains to them the entire process. He assures the family that all sanctions will be taken care of by him and they would get a monthly rent of Rs. 15,000 in addition. In return they are required to submit one person’s Aadhar Card, Ration Card, some other details and a deposit of some odd Rs. 5000. It is to be noted here that the sanction letter mandates the money to be deposited in their lawyer’s account which is more than just strange.For the want of some money, when their financial condition is not the best, they would go for it. In the next meet, this guy shows them the company’s legitimate looking website and hands over a sanction letter seeing which they are pretty satisfied and happy. Now the family is required to pay Rs. 20,000 as some fee in order to start the construction and setting up of the tower. They abide by it and eagerly wait for months in hope of something to happen. I happened to visit one such family and found out about this.Upon further digging, I found more families that they are targeting to extract money from. I took the contact number of one of their representatives and gave him a call asking him to refund the money of one family to which he had to say that it can not be done because the company has already “sanctioned” the request and they do not operate this way. I implore you to read this “sanction letter” and share your views. You might feel that such scams are detectable just by looking at such fake letters but we are talking about the India that is not Facebook and Internet Savvy. Give them Free Basics, give them any service but first spread some awareness about how to’s and do’s and dont’s. While performing any transactions whether offline or online, please check for red flags and suspicious elements and do not just give away your money without consulting anyone.We would also like to urge major telcos to clarify as to the actual processes of setting up Mobile Towers legally.

    "data": "Online shopping is the latest trend these days. With inumerous  e-commerce websites coming up every other day it has become an addiction.  However there are several misconceptions camouflaged behind the comfort and the dangerous place as it still seems to many.To begin with, the most common mis-belief  is that  online shopping helps me “save a lot of time”.  Studies have proven that the time an individual spends in searching products online, looking for coupons and discounts, best offer on each website, tracking again and again etc is way more than going to a store and shopping for desired product. The convenience of browsing through products is the reason many of us while away productive time randomly looking through stuff without a definite target to buy one.  A few of us still hesitate to trust the seller while shopping or doing online transactions. In general data is encryptd which prevents unauthorized access.If you choose to pay by card, your money will be protected with chargeback, a procedure that makes it possible to retrieve the sum paid if you do not receive the item/service or it does not match its description. In such case, your bank is obliged to credit your account with the disputed amount. Chargeback is at your service whenever something goes wrong. Visa and MasterCard have developed a new certification system. Every company that provides payment services is obliged to hold the PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) certification, which is a standard established to ensure the highest security level. There is a lot of competition between retailers on ecommerce platform also. Every platform is working to provide customer satisfaction to maximum. So if you are one of those who believes you will not be able to return or complain about the product take a deep breath and try. Online platforms are always ears for complaints and willing to help and in many situations more than a shop keeper. There are instances where if you are not satisfied with the product the entire money has been refunded to your account and you even get to keep the product. If lack of touch and feel of the product is an issue for you, there are websites which in certain location send the product to your place. You can then see the material, check your size and only if satisfied purchase the product. Online shopping definitely has more  pros than cons. You can make it a better experience by ensuring the following tips:-Always check customer reviews about seller and product before purchasing it.-Always check return policy before purchasing the product. Several items such as perishable food items, under garments, cosmetic, drugs after opening etc are often not covered under return policies.-Even if it is an account on a shopping website, protect it with a strong password-Also check a few tips here.Follow these basic safety steps and it will be a win win situation.Also check out our other blog posts in Digital India series:Digital India Myths: Antivirus,Digital India Myths: Long Password = Secure Account,Digital India Myths: Incognito Mode,Digital India Myths: Facebook,Digital India Myths: Identity TheftReferences:https://www.payu.pl/en/can-i-return-product-buought-web-facts-and-myths-about-online-shopping"

    "headline": "Digital India Myths: Antivirus",
    "data": "As long as we are connected to the Internet, we are surrounded by viruses. The fact that viruses exist and keep on infecting the computers is that they have not been entirely figured out yet, by anyone. In fact, it is pretty amusing that a lot of people believe in many myths and misconceptions about virus and other types of malware, as well as antivirus softwares. To clear up the confusion, The Cyber Blog India has come up with a list of the most common myths that you need to debunk right now-Myth #1: Installing Antivirus means my PC is secure.It is one of the most common misconception about antivirus software that their presence is all you need to secure your computer. Viruses are none other than piece of code, just like your antivirus software. Both, viruses and antivirus softwares are created by those having knowledge of both and to fight against each other. Both viruses and antiviruses keep themselves up to date and compete against each other.Myth #2: My PC is safe as I regularly update my Antivirus.This is another myth that if you update your antivirus software regularly, your computer will not get infected. Some advanced viruses and malware are specially built to trick antivirus softwares.Myth #3: I don’t use Internet on my computer, so there is no way my computer can get infected.Your PC does not get virus and other malwares from Internet only. USB drives, CDs, DVDs are other popular mediums through which infections spread. Malwares may also be present in some of the softwares, games or files you are using, even if they are popular and trusted but taken from untrusted sources like your friend’s harddisk.Myth #4: My Antivirus detected a virus. I must delete it.OrMy Antivirus found some viruses on my system and deleted them. My PC is clean now.Not all the files detected by your antivirus application as ‘infected’ are necessarily infected. There is no guarantee that your antivirus application will treat other beneficial softwares, tools or files in a friendly way. It happens many times that some antivirus applications determine other applications such as anti-spyware, anti-adware or other security applications or sometimes your important files suspiciously and block their usage. So you cannot be sure, whether the ‘infected’ file is really infected or not.Myth #5: Purchased Antivirus is better than Free Antivirus.If you know some programmers and have some money to form a little company, you can also create an antivirus application. So if you think you have purchased an antivirus and now you are more secure, you need to give it a thought again. There are options in the antivirus market that are not only free but also effective enough to keep you secure from most of the common threats. Money cannot decide how good an antivirus software is.Myth #6: I’ll format my computer and all viruses will be gone.Viruses use things to activate themselves called ‘Triggers’. Trigger can be anything like a simple text file like autorun.ini file commonly found in pen drives, any combination key, clicking or double clicking an file and so on.Myth #7: My computer is running slow these days. It must have been infected with virus and I need an Antivirus.It happens most of the time, when your computer gets infected, it starts slowing down the performance, or at least slowing down your internet connection speed because viruses and their cousins tend to connect with their secret servers. But it is not at all necessary that your computer is getting slower which means you computer is infected with viruses. There might be other reason such as you did not run Defragmentation application since long, you have installed many applications on your computer, your hard-disk is full of songs and movies, and many more.Myth #8: I don’t need an Antivirus.Those trying to create viruses, spywares, adwares and also the ones creating vaccines for them in antivirus companies are much smarter than most of us. Not only are they smarter but also they keep evolving every now and then. So we are left with no choice but to trust on antivirus applications for most of the common needs of safety.Above all of those anti-xyz security applications, the best tool to protect yourself is your brain.

    "headline": "Internet Privacy in India: A socio-legal perspective",
    "data": "Everybody has their own way of defining privacy. In simple words, privacy is the right of an individual to make a personal decision regarding his personal matters secluded from public scrutiny. Often people get confused between privacy and security. They are close cousins but different. With the advent of Internet, a new term called Internet Privacy has come into the limelight. Use of internet affects privacy rights of an individual greatly. There is huge amount of personal data about everyone on the internet and what we fail to realize is that we give away this data ourselves. Such internet privacy issues relating to personal data arise from insecure electronic transactions, data trails and logs of email messages, online banking and the tracking of web pages.There is no specific legislation on Internet Privacy and data protection in India. However, the Information Technology Act, 2000 contains specific provisions intended to protect electronic data (including non-electronic records or information that have been, are currently or are intended to be processed electronically). Section 43 and Section 43A of the Act lay down provisions for damaging, stealing, illegally accessing, misusing etc. ones data, computer or computer system etc. Section 72 of the Act also discusses punishment for a person breaching confidentiality by sharing data without consent to which he has secured access. Section 66E talks about individual’s privacy and punishment for violating the same in any electronic form such as transmitting a photo of one’s private part without consent or anything which would violate his privacy. Privacy has also been provided to females under Section 354 A to D introduced by Criminal Law Amendment Act of 2013 after the famous Nirbhaya rape case in December 2012. India’s IT Ministry adopted the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules (Privacy Rules). The Privacy Rules, which took effect in 2011, require corporate entities collecting, processing and storing personal data, including sensitive personal information to comply with certain procedures.Technological advancements such as micro cameras and video surveillance has had a profound effect on personal privacy. Everyone, be it an individual or an organisation has a right to protect and preserve their personal, sensitive and commercial data and information. India at the moment needs a dedicated law protecting the data and personal privacy of an individual. A national privacy policy is still missing in India. A right to privacy bill of India 2011 has been suggested in the year 2011 yet till date we do not have any conclusive draft in this regard that can be introduced in the Parliament of India. In fact, we are still waiting for a public disclosure of final and conclusive proposed draft right to privacy bill 2011 of India that can be discussed in the Parliament. The laws should be made keeping both genders in mind rather than protecting only female rights because in the cyber space both males and females are equal victims. A gender neutral law is as crucial as a technological neutral legislation. Protecting the privacy rights of individuals requires a re-conceptualization on both personal as well as professional grounds keeping in mind human privacy in the context of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs)."

    "headline": "The E-Raksha Campaign- Join Us",
    "data": "It is almost going to be 10 months since our inception as an organization and through this post we are happy to share our first collaborative national campaign. Not producing a formal document, I would like to share an account of a very fruitful meeting we had with Lt. Vineet Kumar from The Cyber Peace Foundation and Mr. Vishal Kaushik from PRAHARI, UPES.We started with sharing our experiences of conducting awareness programs in the country. The learning and challenges by all organisations were the same. After at least a decade of established cyber crime, it is necessary to understand that this protection or raksha(hindi) that we talk about under the umbrella term “Cyber Security” needs to be technical, legal and practical. The discussion on these fronts tossed new ideas and concepts. Cyber or Information Security is mostly confused to be technical, coded and wireless or hard wired. Cyber Security although in the simplest yet the most complicated way is a kind of nexus between optimal technology, awareness and the law. As we talked about this, many more ideas surfaced of dedicated campaigns for awareness and promotion of secure application development, personal cyber hygiene and other things.This is when The E-Raksha campaign was highlighted. Originally, an initiative of The Cyber Peace Foundation, The E-Raksha project has been about reaching out to schools, talking to kids and disseminating safe digital practices. Apart from that the campaign is also about  events for identifying innovation, promoting careers in the field of Cyber Security and conducting competitions. The idea about E-Raksha has been that if all organisations, not just ours are working independently, there is going to be no impact analysis. Whether there is actual Cyber Security or not, we will never find out, whether there are the required number of professionals in the country, we will never know. Whether or not, people in one part of the country are using one particular technology or not, it is not going to be possible.This campaign is going to be about doing what we do, and the same for the other organisations as well but by common standards and platform that will act as a common medium for people to interact. What exactly this is going to be will be clearer in the next few days. For now, what you can do as a reader/organisation/individual is write to us if you wish to be a part of the national campaign. "

    "headline": "What Is Cyber Exhaust? How To Reduce It?",
    "data": " Every thing that goes online, voluntarily or involuntarily, has some value and thus becomes a fair game for data mining. You wouldn’t even know, but the information about what you just shared on Facebook, or what answer you just upvoted on Quora gets stored on databases which is later used for flooding you with “things you may like.” The motive behind data mining is to create a profile of how you behave on the internet; what your preferences are; and socio-economic status, even without your knowledge.There are numerous arguments supporting data mining as a tool that helps in customizing online experience, but actually the data extracted from your personal space is purchased and sold between hundreds of companies, from online shopping portals to dating sites, whose services you may never use. This sale and purchase of data which causes a flood of advertisements can be reduced by reducing your data exhaust. Data exhaust is the amount of data you’re giving away to get mined. Exhaust can be reduced, but can’t be completely stopped. Below are some tips you should follow to reduce this cyber exhaust.Be As Private as PossibleProvide only necessary details, and hide as much data as you can on social media profiles, online accounts, and even on your browser. This can be done by disabling cookies, turning off location services and opting out of online trackers in order to provide as little information as possible.Use Privacy Add-onsThere are various add-ons and plug-ins for browsers that can help you reduce your cyber exhaust. One such tool is Privacy Badger. It is a browser add-on that stops advertisers and other third-party trackers from secretly tracking where you go and what pages you look at on the web.Log Out EverytimeThere are trackers always tracking for your information. So, for an extra layer of privacy, log out of your social media accounts when browsing the web to avoid trackers from sending information to social media channels.Use Privacy AlternativesAs a result of the data mining, concerned users turn to alternative tools, such as browsers, VPN services and social media services that help to hide their online footprints."

    "headline": "Digital India Myths: Incognito Mode",
    "data": "Although you take steps to improve your privacy and security while browsing the web, it’s not possible to be totally anonymous on the Internet. Majority of the Internet users feel that using Incognito Mode or Private Browsing mode on their browser makes them anonymous. This is so not true. Even using Tor or a VPN doesn’t grant you full anonymity, because each service uses some kind of identifier to distinguish you from other users. (Even VPN providers that advertise anonymous services can log your name, your IP address, and other pieces of information about your activity.)Anonymity isn’t a realistic goal when you’re talking about browsing the Internet. But protecting your privacy is. Taking basic steps to protect yourself will greatly improve your privacy. But it’s important to remember that it won’t make your activities anonymous.As I mentioned, it is a common myth that using Incognito Mode or Private Browsing on browser will make you anonymous in cyber space. So here are a few things to take care of while talking about Incognito Browsing:Although things like cookies and history are deleted when you close your browser, but there are a lot of ways you are being tracked even when you are using Incognito Mode. Some of them are IP Address and Logins.Your browsing history is not recorded by your browser but your internet service provider can still see what are you surfing.Even though you can’t see your past activity, the rest of internet can.You could still be profiled and be shown targeted ads on the basis of what you searched.And above all of these, this information can be requested by Law Enforcement Agencies.So, contrary to its name, Private Browsing or Incognito Mode, your activity is still monitored unless you use services that don’t track you by default like DuckDuckGo. Since complete anonymity can not be achieved but our digital footprints can still be minimized. So do take care of what you browse on Internet! This is the fifth post in Digital India Myths Series.

I was surprised that people were not aware of the basic setting options available. This post is an easy step by step guide to help you set the best security for your profile. For this start from going to Settings under the drop down menu on top right corner.Login AlertsTurn on this setting by selecting “ Get Notifications” and get notified whenever someone logs into your Facebook account from anywhere. These alerts are emailed to you.Code GeneratorCode Generator adds two step authentication to your Facebook account. Click here to read about it.App PasswordIt helps you set up a different password or passcodes for apps so that your original password is safe.Trusted Contacts\nOften we forget passwords. Facebook lets you choose two to three trusted contacts. Now a passcode will be sent to these trusted contacts in case you forget your password. Simply ping your friend and ask him the passcode received to get an access back to your account.Where you’re logged inUsing Facebook on your mobile and laptop? This helps you review where all you are currently logged in. It also helps you check if you are logged in from a suspicious place such as a third persons laptop. You can close that session from here.Legacy ContactIf you wish to stay alive forever on Facebook you can select a friend or family member who manages your account after you pass away. They will not be able to post on your behalf. Just accept friend request, pin post to your profile and change your profile picture. Staying immortal isn’t a dream anymore after all. Who can see my stuff?Who can see your future posts?\nFriends. Now only friends on Facebook can see your posts and not the public.Review all posts that you are tagged in?Yes. Many of us are fedup of being tagged in photos of friends. At times we are tagged in photos and videos which might have objectionable content. This can even land us behind bars. Reviewing posts you are tagged in lets you chose what is displayed on your profile rather than blindly adding every post you are tagged in as a post.Limit the Audience for Old Posts on your timeline. \nUse this tool to limit the visibility of your public posts in past to only friends. Only friends of people tagged can see the posts apart from your friendsWho can send you friend requests?\nIf you don’t use Facebook for professional purpose, limit the friend requests you receive to friends of friends.

This separates messages from unknown people and friends.Who can look you up using the email address you provided?\nFriends. Your email is equally important as your password to login on Facebook. If we work so hard trying to keep our passwords a secret, then why not email?Who can look you up using the number you provided?\nFriends. Do I really need to repeat why?Do you want search engines outside Facebook to link to your profile?\nNever select this option. Otherwise the next thing you will find all your photos and information on Google.

    "headline": "Digital India Myths: Long Password = Secure Account",
    "data": "Where the rest of the world is switching to two and three factor authentications, for a fact most of the Internet users in India are beginning to use passwords sanely. For security both online and offline, only password authentication is turning out to be a failure. After speaking to the masses living in the upcoming digital spaces of India and after hearing the crimes that have been committed against them, it is safe to conclude that the highest number are due to bad digital practises of the users. Sadly, Long Password = Secure Account is one of them.\nNow, why is a long password not enough?\nThe only problem with Indian users we have observed is that our passwords mean something. If your mother’s or girlfriend’s name is your password with a “@123” at the end, it does not matter how long the name is. If today your passwords mean something, they are breakable. So, the first thing as a user you need to do is review each and every password. Starting from your WiFi router to your ATM pin. Do not let any password mean anything; avoid using @123 or 123! in the suffix. The reason for that is again simple, you are giving the liberty to an attacker to attempt to breach and also ensuring the required probability that one of the combinations work. I was at a conference a couple of days back and they had a WiFi network protected with a password and WPA2 encryption. I did not know the password and very urgently needed to use the Internet. I punched in just the name of the router itself and suffixed a “123” and to my surprise I got connected. It was a long name, but too insecure for the simple reason again that it meant something.There are technologies in the banking sector like OTPs on a mobile device which I am sure most of the users are aware of. What every user needs to know is that these two factor authentications are usable beyond the banking sector. In the era where data is more expensive than any other thing, it is terribly important to safeguard your identity and other personal information. You can read about how to set up two factor authentication on Google Authenticator here. In a nutshell what you can do today is review all your passwords and:1. Keep a different password for all online and offline accounts and devices.\n2. Stop using traditional and default passwords.\n3. Do not suffix “@123”, “123!” etc. just to fulfill the requirements of a password field.\n4. Do not let your password mean anything. Keep it abstract and don’t let it resemble something that someone can guess.To read this article in Hindi, click here. इस आर्टिकल को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें।"

    "headline": "Save Your Sensitive Information From Malicious INSIDERS!",
    "data": "A sensitive information is always at a threat from outside hackers, and we’ve employed a number of methods and tools to prevent it. But there are people sitting inside the organization too, who pose a threat to this information. These people are called ‘insiders.’ An insider threat, according to WhatIs, is a malicious hacker who is an employee or officer of a business, institution, or agency. The term can also apply to an outside person who poses as an employee or officer by obtaining false credentials. The hacker obtains access to the computer systems or networks of the enterprise, and then conducts activities intended to cause harm to the enterprise.Following are a few suggestions you should apply in order to avoid attacks from inside to a great extent.Monitor, Discover, and Protect: Know where your most important, and confidential data is stored. Always keep a check on this data. This might be a tricky job, as large organizations tend to have scattered and large databases which are quite difficult to track.Image source: GreenSQLSegregate and Mask: Segregation of data according to the employees’ needs is the smartest move one can apply to ensure security from within. Employees must be given access to the data they need, and usage of this data must be monitored. Real time masking is also a method to avoid a breach. Masking is technique in which all the information is not visible to one viewing it, thus barring the viewer from accessing the entire data. This can be achieved by using a dynamic data masking tool. Use Multi-Layered Technique: A multi-layered technique like using a two-factor authentication tool, or bio-metric tools along with a password or pin can be employed in order to ensure extra security. This will keep a track of ‘who’ is accessing ‘what,’ and thus monitoring will be easy.   Use Security Tools: There are a lots of tools that will help you monitor your important information, like FileAudit and UserLock. UserLock by ISDecisions is a tool that’s widely because of its easy-to-use interface and functionality.  It does the following things for you:Stops unauthorized access, especially when the password credential is compromised.Doesn’t allow password sharing by preventing concurrent logins.Immediate response to suspicious behaviorRemote locks and masks on user’s sightImage Source: http://www.isdecisions.com/The following video depicts how this tool may be helpful to your organization:   "

    "headline": "Website Compromised? Here Are Some Steps You Must Follow.",
    "data": "Crores of websites in India were hacked and put down last year. Lakhs of websites are blacklisted by search engines every week. Thousands of them get permanently banned. You must have come across the warning – “This site may harm your computer.” This is what happens when a site gets blacklisted, and this affects the number of visits on the site. Thus, you must take the following steps in the event of a breach. Verify the Compromise: Obvious, it may seem but just by visiting a site can’t always tell you whether it has been breached or not, and moreover if you feel it’s infected, do not look for malwares as it may expose your PC.If you feel it’s been breached, either use Google Search Console or use a website malware scanner which uses FTP to access files on the site, so that the source code can also be scanned. Also ask for help from your hosting provider to verify the compromise.Put Down the Site and Change Passwords: after verifying that the site is infected, take it down as sson as possible. This will reduce more harm to it. Doing this will also reduce the risk of putting out the sensitive information about the users of the site. Also assume that all your passwords have been compromised and change all of them.Assess and Decide a Fix: These are a few options which you can choose to do:Hosting providers generally do the scan and remove malwares for a trivial charge. Ask them for help.There are various malware removal tools available online which can be bought and used for this purpose. The manufacturers of these tools also provide with experts who can guide you on this.If you have a backup of your site available, restore it. This is the best and cheapest way for recovering your siteLastly, you can attempt to remove them yourself. There are plenty of videos online which will guide you through the processScan Your PC: After you’ve successfully restored your website, you’ll have to permanently remove all the potential sources of infections. The first thing you should do in this respect is to scan and remove anything left in your PC. Use a good antivirus to do this, and to prevent any malware from entering into your PC, follow our previous posts.Upgrade Website Software: Another potential source can be a not-updated software. Vulnerable software is at more risk of being compromised than updated software. If you’re using a CMS, then they constantly provide patches for updates; never skip one. The operating system at the server end must also be updated regularly.Change Passwords and Encryption Keys: Once you’re confident that the site is secure again, change all the passwords and keys. Weak passwords are a treat for hackers, so set up a stronger and more unique password. Encryption keys can give away all the communications between the site and clients. Thus, change them too.Get Your Site Delisted: If the site is still on blacklist, request for a review. After the search engine reviews it, it’ll remove the warnings that appear before the site opens. This generally happens within 24 hours. To request a review with Google, click here and for Bing, click here.Prevent This From Happening Again: Preventing such activities in future is the most difficult part, but practicing some steps regularly will prevent this.Scan regularly for vulnerabilitiesUpdate software as soon as it is ready to updateSubscribe to WAF (Web Application Firewall) serviceChange passwords regularlyBack-up the site regularly"

    "headline": "Digital India Myths: Facebook",
    "data": "This post is third in the series about the myths that people in India have about Computers, Mobiles, Internet and the Cyber Space.With over 120 million users on Facebook, India is surely one of the largest user base for various social media platforms. The number of Facebook users in India have doubled in just 3 years. With such mass adoption there are certainly a lot of myths revolving around Facebook. Following are the most common myths:I have set my privacy to “Friends.” I’m safe now.\nThis is the most common misconception Indians have about Facebook. Although protecting personal information from unknown people is of critical importance, but there are various cases in which victim’s friends were the real culprit. It’s good that you have set your privacy as “Friends”, but you still need to take care of everything you share on social media. Moreover, you can set-up two factor authentication for your accounts to prevent unauthorised access.\n\nFacebook is only for Younger Generation.\nEven though people aged between 15-35 are major social media users but Facebook is well set to feature both younger generation and older generation. In recent times there has been a trend of post-40 entering various social platforms of the virtual world. The trouble arises because this generation is often not aware of the most basic security settings and is too fascinated which ends up in becoming a deadly combo.People can tell when you have looked at their Facebook profiles.\nThis is nothing more than just a rumor. Facebook has clarified in help section that it doesn’t let people track who views their profile. Even third party apps can not provide such functionality. Facebook even encourages users to report such misleading apps.\nSource: Huffington PostSource: Huffington PostAll news on Facebook or other social media is true and I can believe it.\nSocial media is a perfect platform for spreading false news. Always confirm the news from alternate sources like TV, newspapers etc. There have been a lot of instances where there were posts like some celebrity has died, but in the end it was just a rumour being spread through social media. Liking or sharing false news can also land you into serious trouble.\nCredits: Sprout SocialCredits: Sprout SocialMy personal information is sold to criminals.\nEvery social media platform has its own set of privacy settings and so has Facebook. Everytime we sign up for a new social media platform, most of us don’t even see what exactly privacy settings are. For example, multiple check-ins with privacy mode set to public on Instagram or say Facebook is surely giving an insight to criminal about your current location.\nWe can do anything by creating a fake ID and we won’t get caught.\nThis should not come as a surprise but every time you log in, your IP Address details, session time etc. are recorded by Facebook and other platforms. In cases like online defamation, a notice is served under Section 91 of CrPC and the concerned platform has to reply with all the details they have about the asked account.Whatever is in virtual world, exists in reality.\nDid you accept that friend request just because the person was looking hot in profile picture?\nNot every person we meet online is a real person. Cyber space has pros as well as cons. You want to connect to people on social media, connect to the ones you already know. Sometimes the so-called friendship in virtual world becomes so horrible that it leads to harassment, blackmailing, financial demands etc. from his/her “virtual” friend. (Read more about fake accounts on Legal Implications of Fake Profiles and How to spot one?).Social Media Platforms like Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. have become an integral part of our lives. As I said, cyber space has pros as well as cons. And there exists a very thin line between staying secure and becoming vulnerable. It is upto us how we maintain our digital footprints and online presence.Read our previous posts in the Digital India Myths series on Virus & Identity Theft here and here."

    "headline": "Digital India Myths: Virus",
    "data": "This post is the first in a series about the myths that people in India have about Computers, Mobiles, Internet and the Cyber Space. While the Digital India is supposedly growing in the metropolitan cities, the real (needs to be) Digital India is living in a disconnect and most blacked out zones of awareness. We need to progress, yes all this and other big, heavy words have been talked about and spoken at many confluences but action is needed now in terms of awareness. And our belief lies in the fact that Awareness and Sensitization is the key to Cyber Safety.So what is this myth number one?Virus! People have this one common way of addressing anything that goes wrong with their computers or mobiles: “I have a virus in my device. Oh my God! I might need to get it formatted.” The first thing you are going to do as an end user is going to a shop nearby and handing over your device. The guy at the shop will speak some heavy words to you and charge you a good amount of money for doing nothing. If you are not among the lot, believe me, there is a huge number of people who still practice this.First things first, troubleshoot and research about your problem online and try to find out “how to” articles about fixes. Even then there are a lot of other things you can do. Only approach a local vendor in case of a real hardware problem. For any help needed, you can always ping us on Whatsapp on our helpline number @ +917832085146.Anyway, the Virus is just a small part of other Malware that can attack your device. Remember, a virus is a notorious piece of code that can of course cause in house damage to your system but trust me on this; it is not the real threat to you these days. If I am right here and I would also like to call for comments about this, the best piece of example about virus was the pen drive folder in folder virus where executable files with names and icons of the folders in the pen drive were created automatically. Later fixed with updates on different platforms, the problem was solved.The real threat today is targeted malware that goes undetected by a lot of firewalls, IPSs and Anti-Malware programs. The essential difference is the fact that advanced malware attacks are even livelier; often embedded into different file types and abstracted. They are often persistent i.e. they stay on your machine after you believe you have removed them and even attack your system kernel (the underlying component of your device entirely not the Operating System) sometimes. Malware often have connections embedded into them that can allow access of your device to an attacker sitting in some other part of the world. That is how there has come up a new set of attacks called the ransomware. I have witnessed laptops being wiped clean and drives being encrypted through these.So to conclude, virus is a part of Malware but now, is long dead. As we step into the digital space all guns blazing, we need to be aware about these things. Many might just think, Oh! Its virus and malware, I know about all this, I don’t need to read. But in principle this is all evolving and at great speeds. We need to catch up and be aware in order to be safe. To read more, you can lookup our post Secure Yourself Against Malwares.\n"

    "headline": "Where we stand after 15 years of IT Act !!",
    "data": "17th October 2000 marked the beginning of nothing less than a revolution in Indian cyberspace. It was a birth of new era where IT Law came into existence defining boundaries, powers and governing people’s action online. Today as we complete 15 years of this revolution, let’s take a look at how far we have come.Though the act came into being in 2000, only few applications of complaint were received from major metropolitan cities during the first decade. However, crime started picking pace after that. According to National Crime Record Bureau reports, there has been an increase of 60.06% in cases registered and 64.15% in arrests made under IT act since 2012 and the number continues to rise. Similarly, an increase of 73.54% in cases registered and 55.14% in arrests made under IPC since 2012. The first adjudication obtained under this provision was in Chennai, Tamil Nadu in a case involving ICICI Bank in which the bank was told to compensate the applicant with the amount wrongfully debited in Internet Banking, along with cost and damages.The IT Act 2000 did not encapsulate all areas of cyber law. The act was not technologically neutral. Hence, it underwent major amendments in 2008 which introduced the concept of “electronic signature” which had a much broader meaning than “digital signature” also covering other means such as biometrics.However, the IT Act has never been self-sufficient. IPC and Indian Evidence Act were also amended to support it. The definition of Indian Evidence Act was amended to “all documents including electronic records”. Terms such as ‘digital signature’, ‘electronic form’, ‘secure electronic record’ ‘information’ as used in the ITA, were also inserted to make them part of evidentiary importance under the Act. The important amendment was seen by recognition of admissibility of electronic records as evidence as enshrined in Section 65B of the Act. Similarly one of the major changes in IPC was inclusion of section 354 A to D which recognised women centric crimes such as stalking, voyeurism, sexual harassment etc. Despite the constant evaluation process over all these years, the IT Act still fails to be enough. The virtual world of cyber crime has always led to issues of territorial jurisdiction. Pertaining to this, as a result investigators often try to not accept complaints.Infographic: First Cases and Conviction with setting up of CAT (Cyber Appellate Tribunal) The preservation of evidence is another hurdle. There are chances of destroying the evidence as it may lie in some system like the intermediaries’ computer or sometimes in the opponent’s computer system too. Crimes like gambling and trafficking over the internet are not recognised despite several complaints from the public. Privacy continues to stay a myth in the cyberspace. Voices have been repeatedly raised to recognise privacy rights of individual however till what level investigation procedures and privacy can harmonise is hard to say. The recent issue of making it mandatory to save Whatsapp chat is a perfect example of privacy violation.In my personal opinion, gender issue is another thing which is not left behind here as well. The Indian laws are clearly biased towards females. What we fail to understand is that males are equally or in many cases more prone to being victim of cyber crime. According to a survey, more men than women are victims of cyber crime. Isn’t gender neutrality as important as technological neutrality? Revenge porn is another grey area of cyber laws.Today, as we adorn our profile pics with tri-colors supporting PM Modi’s dream of digital India we can be assured that all this is just the beginning. With Internet of Things, there is no scope of reduced rate of cyber crime but being smart digital citizens is what we can ensure. I can sum up the 15 years of IT Act in simple words:  “Begun, but not well done.” We still have a long way to go and need to improvise the legislation greatly but the question is, is law the only thing we can depend on? Another 30 years to the IT Act and yet it will never be enough. Its time we as individuals stop acting and raising voice on social media platforms and take some real time action. You and I need to face the reality, make security a priority and be responsible netizens. If such a change is brought, the development in next 5 years would be way more than where we have reached in past 15 years and yes, the dream of Digital India would be half accomplished.References:http://www.mondaq.com/india/x/257328/Data+Protection+Privacy/An+Overview+Of+Cyber+Laws+vs+Cyber+Crimes+In+Indian+Perspective "

    "data": "Before writing this post, I take the premise that you are aware of the recent Patel agitation in Gujarat. Even if you are not, you must be aware of situations where things happening online have led to riots and processions. Government and even the Judiciary in certain cases have taken the stand to protect National Integrity and Harmony by employing all available provisions in law. If you are a law student, legal practitioner or someone who understands law, all this would make sense a little easily to you. For those who aren’t of this domain, let me follow the simple path.The Government during the Patel Quota Agitation blocked access to all Mobile Internet Services against which a law student in Gujarat approached the Hon’ble High Court in a Public Interest Litigation declaring that such block was unconstitutional. For those wondering how, the Government had taken the course of Section 144 of the CrPc (Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973) in order to block access. Now I am focusing on the crucial arguments in the case. First, that the competent authority could not take course of Section 144 of the CrPc, it should have used Section 69A of the Information Technology Act, 2000. The ban meant no Internet Access on any mobile device, starting from WhatsApp to Mobile Banking services: For some this meant professional loss as well.If you want an in depth study of the sections you could look them up together and read. For the purpose of this post, I am going to pick up the gist of the idea. The language used under sub-section (1) of Section 144 is that any District Magistrate, a Sub-divisional Magistrate or any other Executive Magistrate specially empowered by the State Government may “direct any person to abstain from a certain act or to take certain order with respect to certain property in his possession or under his management, to prevent, or tends to prevent, obstruction, annoyance or injury to any person lawfully employed or danger to human life, health or safety, or a disturbance of the public tranquillity, or a riot, or an affray”. In light of this part of the legislation, the Government issued a notification to ban all Mobile Internet services.Section 69A of the IT Act allows the Government to block access to certain websites. It says:  “in the interest of sovereignty and integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence relating to above”. A direction can be issued under Section 69A for blockage of public access to such information and it may also be relating to “any information generated, transmitted, received, stored or posted in any computer resource”.The defence counsel contended that 69A and 144 are two independent sections and with different applications. 69A is of the nature of blocking access to certain services only whereas this situation was about restoring public harmony and blocked access to only certain websites could not solve the problem. Somehow the court agreed to this course and also the counsel’s statement that had Section 144 not been used “peace could not have been restored with the other efforts made by the State for maintenance of the law and order”.Second, not the entire Internet Access should have been blocked but only access to social media websites as per the notification. In words of the argument, “complete blockage of access to internet through mobile could not be said as warranted in law.” And quoting again from the judgement, the reply to this contention:” This contention cannot be countenanced for two reasons;one is that normally, it should be left to the authority to find out its own mechanism for controlling the situation andThe second is that there are number of social media sites which may not be required to be blocked independently or completely. But if internet access through mobiles is blocked by issuing directions to the mobile companies, that may possibly be more effective approach found by the competent authority. In any case, it was not a complete ban on the internet access, but in comparison to the access available to internet through mobile, the same was only prohibited, whereas access to internet through broadband and wi-fi facility was permitted or rather was not blocked.Source: Judgment on Gaurav Sureshbhai Vyas V.

    "headline": "I Surf Secure Websites, Do You??",
    "data": "Why does a website need security certificate?Attackers often create malicious sites to gather your information. You should always be cautious while entering your information on any website. Security can be ensured by checking that the website content is in encrypted form. Two elements that indicate a site uses encryption are:a closed padlock, located in the status bar at the bottom of your browser window or at the top of the browser window between the address and search fieldsa URL that begins with “https:” rather than “http:”A security certificate indicates that the security authority has taken steps to verify the URL belongs to the authority and is genuine.  In case of a problem your browser will send you an alert notification telling that there is an error in the site certificate. Such alert notifications should always been taken seriously. In case you have any doubt do not enter your personal details over the website. Even if the information is encrypted, make sure to read the organization’s privacy policy first so that you know what is being done with that information.Can you trust a certificate?Having or not having a certificate is a secondary thought. When you open a URL your browser checks the following:the web site address matches the address on the certificatethe certificate is signed by a certificate authority that the browser recognizes as a “trusted” authorityIf the web address matches the address on the certificate, the certificate is signed by a trusted certificate authority, and the date is valid, you can be more confident that the site is genuine. However you can only be absolutely sure when you personally verify that certificate’s unique fingerprint by calling the organization directly.  The question that arise before that is how trustworthy is this certificate. By default, your browser contains a list of more than 100 trusted certificate authorities.How do you check a certificate?The information of a website certificate can be checked in the menu under the file properties or the security option within page information. Following details would be included under the information:who issued the certificate – You should make sure that the issuer is a legitimate, trusted certificate authority (you may see names like VeriSign, thawte, or Entrust). Some organizations also have their own certificate authorities that they use to issue certificates to internal sites such as intranets.who the certificate is issued to – The certificate should be issued to the organization who owns the web site. Do not trust the certificate if the name on the certificate does not match the name of the organization or person you expect.expiration date – Most certificates are issued for one or two years. One exception is the certificate for the certificate authority itself, which, because of the amount of involvement necessary to distribute the information to all of the organizations who hold its certificates, may be ten years. Be wary of organizations with certificates that are valid for longer than two years or with certificates that have expired.References:\nhttps://www.us-cert.gov/ncas/tips/ST05-010"

    "headline": "Prevention and Control of Cyber Terrorism",
    "data": "Terrorism is continually changing. While at the surface, it remains “the calculated use of unlawful violence or threat of unlawful violence to inculcate fear.” In the wake of the recent computer attacks, a new breed of terrorism is on the rise and our country must defend itself with all possible means.Cyber Terrorism may be defined as “the premeditated use of disruptive activities, or threat thereof, in cyberspace, with the intention to further social, ideological, religious, political or similar objectives, or to intimidate any person in furtherance to such objectives.”Cyber Terrorism can be traced back to June 1944’s attack on the communication system and logistic support of Germany. Thereafter, the USA Defense Department started Internet and Computer Networks and evolved the ICANN (Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers) system to regulate cyberspace. In 1988, Osama Bin Laden established “Al-Qaeda” based on “Jihad” and the same year, West German hackers accessed the Department of Defense Systems of the USA. Thereafter “Gulf War” was the first information war or I-war. By 1995, the Internet became popular through the World Wide Web in India and before that LTTE groups’ (militant groups that fought for a separate Tamil state between 1976 and 2009) activities were dependent on websites and the Internet.Attack on National Security: National security depends on confidentiality and secret information. When terrorists attack them, they delete or modify this information or purport to do the same.Cyber Terrorism is the Forerunner of Warfare: Warfare or NET warfare occurs when one nation causes terrorist violence against another nation using new technology.International Cyber Terrorist Attack: When international terrorist groups communicate with each other through the Internet to attack any nation then it may fall under an Internationally planned cyber terrorist attack.Network to Send Terror Message: Cybercriminals have started using technology to develop their own website to send terror messages and to communicate within or between groups.Digital Signature System: Terrorists use e-mail, SMS, encryption programs and digital signature systems to communicate securely and confidentially.Flowing Worm: Flowing “Worms”, Viruses, and Trojan Horses to collapse government and people interest sites, networks and computers is also one mode of cyber terrorism.Cyber Theft: Includes downloading illegal music files, and stealing millions of dollars from online bank accounts.Case Study: Cyber Terrorism against Indian Parliament:In the year 2001, the Indian Parliament was attacked with the help of information technology. The accused forged an official gate pass with the logo of the Ministry of Home Affairs and other information along with the layout of the Indian Parliament. Police found a laptop from the main accused Md. Afzal and S. Hussein Guru. They also found out that they did it through a Pakistani Internet Service Provider. They controlled the identity and E-mail system of the Indian Army.Even the 11th September 2001 attack on WTC can fall under cyber terrorism. Terrorists had unauthorized access to the network of one airline and the hijacking of two airlines. This resulted in the crashing of those airlines into the WTC Twin Towers and the Pentagon.The Information Technology (Amendment) Act 2008 has made the provision for cyber terrorism under Section 66F. It provides a Life Sentence, though the definition is not very comprehensive. This section is a combination of Section 66 [Computer-related offences] and Section 70 [Protected System] of the Act. What separates section 66F from other sections is the degree and nature of the offence.Although there are many protective measures available for private corporations, there are several hurdles preventing corporations from implementing them:Firstly, implementing all of the necessary protective measures is expensive for private corporations. Depending on the size of the corporation, it could cost hundreds of thousands of dollars for a consultant to determine the corporation’s vulnerabilities and install protective measures.Secondly, determining a corporation’s computer systems vulnerabilities, installing security software, and upgrading it is very time-consuming. It takes time away from fostering the corporation’s business purpose and decreases profits.Thirdly, many of the security systems and complex technological advances in cyber-terrorism protective software are confusing and difficult to learn. It often takes a computer security specialist to determine what the corporation needs for security and how to install it.Finally, many private corporations do not want to report cyber-terrorist incidents to the authorities. It is embarrassing for a private corporation to have its network’s security breached."

Soon after her return she was interviewed by Hindustan, one of the Hindi Daily Newspapers of the country.A couple of days later, she received a call from the zonal representative of the newspaper that she had been selected for an award to be presented to her by the D.M., S.S.P. and other dignataries of the district in a district level function. The function was U.P. Mahila Shiksha Suraksha and apart from Rachiyta 10 other females were awarded who had made contributions to any of the dynamic sectors of Education, Livelihood and Public Welfare. She was awarded for the work that she has been doing for the last 8 months. She says, ” We are a small organisation right now, We have dreams and other aspirations like any other social startup would. But our team is together and dedicated to the one cause is what makes us different.”The Award got us in touch with Saharanpur Police and the recent collaboration that it got us which I shared about in my last post. Anyway, we were travelling and suddenly we received this call again from the Hindustan Zonal Representative about Rachiyta’s selection for the same award that is given at a state level. Now one woman from each district of the state of U.P. was going to be awarded on the same lines.Rachiyta received this award on behalf and for The Cyber Blog India on 28th July, 2015. She was presented this award by the Chief Minister of the state, Shri Akhilesh Yadav. We have received enormous love and support from our families, friends and most importantly the netizens we serve as a blog, resource persons for workshops, online support system and an organisation at large. I am a happy part of what I call The Cyber Blog India coalesce. Congratulations to Rachiyta Jain and the entire team. "

    "headline": "Everyday Mistakes We Make Online",
    "data": "When it comes to cyber security, attackers exploit the vulnerable areas of a target. The Cyber Blog India short listed some mistakes we make on daily basis.Downloading third-party apps:  Several people download paid apps from third-party app stores and websites. This possesses a great risk to their privacy. There might be a possibility that the app has been repackaged with malicious code and made available to download for free to lure users.Browsing on Public Wi-Fi or insecure connections: We all love free Wifi but do we understand the security risks? The answer is No, we don’t. In short, using public Wi-Fi potentially allows an attacker to steal important data like online banking passwords etc. Make sure that your connection is secure before dealing with sensitive information online.Oversharing on Social Media: Todays generation is keen on sharing details of almost every hour of their lives online across different social media platforms. There is a possibility that this information might be used for social engineering by a hacker or criminal in future to target the victim on an online as well as offline platform.Using Same Password for all Accounts: One of the biggest mistake you do to your online presence is securing your social media, banking, email or any other form of account using same password. In such situations you compromise the security of multiple accounts together.Ignoring updates: The scope of cyber crime is not limited to phishing pages or sharing personal pictures. You can be a victim of cyber crime even when you have not updated your applications to the latest version. If you forget to update your apps regularly, turn on auto-update feature in your app store.Trusting someone too much: Sharing passwords with your bestfriend seems right? Well, if it’s a yes, then think again. Relationships are never constant. A person who is no more you best friend due to whatever circumstances might misuse the access you have granted to him/her to your account.Ignoring SSL Certificate warnings: This is another major mistake we are looking at but is surely not the last.You probably have at some point visited a website and seen a security warning that it is not a safe connection, and you might have continued with that.\n\nTo read this article in Hindi, click here. इस आर्टिकल को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें।"

    "headline": "Replace OTPs with USB Security key",
    "data": "Two factor authentication provides an extra layer of security to your account. It provides a method of combining two different kinds of login approaches to add some extra security, but that’s not enough. 2FA is stronger than password based authentication, but it is prone to phishing attacks. An account that has a very strong password, and is secured with a 2FA service that sends an OTP everytime you try to login may not be completely hack-proof. The OTP generated through various random algorithms can also be defeated. Various phishing sites can trick users to enter both their password and temporary codes, and thus the attacker can easily bypass the security.Dropbox, a cloud based storage service has done some research in this respect, and they have concluded that complete reliance on one time passwords can sometimes be dangerous. So, they have started a new feature that requires a FIDO U2F security key, which looks like the picture below. This can be used additionally with your password as a second factor tool, and unless you lose it, it can’t be tricked.Image Source: amazon.com The Security Key only works on Google Chrome for now. Starting with this version, the browser has built-in support for an open protocol called Universal 2nd Factor (U2F) that was developed by the FIDO Alliance. FIDO is a multi-vendor alliance that aims to develop hack-proof second factor authentication tools. Various other websites can also use this protocol as it is supported by Chrome. This physical key doesn’t just provide a tool for 2FA but it also ensures using cryptography that the site is not a phishing site, to be extra cautious.If you want to buy this authentication tool, you’ll have to buy a FIDO certified device from any vendor selling it. Currently, it is available only on Amazon’s international site for around $18, but it can also be bought in India from local vendors for little less. Just make sure they have the “FIDO U2F Ready” logo on them.Apart from this USB key, there are various devices that are being developed for this purpose like audio jack authenticator, USB touch authenticator etc."

    "data": "India is the third largest smartphone market in the world and still continues to grow every second. People change phones every 6 months. Roaming around with the latest gadget has become the new definition of “cool.” With a smartphone in every second pocket, easily available buyers and in-numerous platforms to sell, it has also become the favorite accessory to steal.In the NCRB (National Crime Record Bureau of India) reports, the number of stolen phones is so high that a separate sub heading for mobile thefts has been created. The latest report shows 37,878 mobiles were stolen in 2014 of which 43% were from Delhi followed up by Maharashtra(34.3%), Bengal(25.9%) and UP(35.7%). Only 9,055 or 23.9% of stolen phones were actually returned to their owners. The rest probably made it to the black market.We often do not understand what we jeopardize when we lose a phone or sell it. Many of us commit the buffoonery of selling the phone without wiping the data. Others who do, think they are completely out of danger. We fail to realize that the data can be recovered very easily by tools easily available online. This means compromising our privacy, security, personal details, social media details, photographs etc. which can easily be misused.People often complain about the Police not registering their FIR of their lost or stolen phones. In this regard the Centre has issued an advisory to all states for compulsory registration of FIR under Section 154 of CrPC. The National Telecom Policy of 2012 had provided for facilitating establishment of a National Mobile Property Registry for addressing security, theft and other issues. In this regard a registry of zonal integrated police network (ZIPNET)  is created which consists IMEI number of lost/stolen phones.A phone which was once stolen, then used to commit a crime may be available for sale today. Thus before buying a second hand phone we should always check the list of stolen/lost mobile phones on ZIPNET to ensure personal safety.  Buying or selling phones is not a hassle free task. Many have fallen prey to the complications attached. Act wisely and patiently before buying a used set or selling your old set.Shaikh, Zeeshan. “37,878 Mobiles Stolen in 2014, 43% of them from Delhi.” The Indian Express 13 August. 2015 : pg 8. Print."

    "headline": "These 5 bad digital habits you must avoid",
    "data": "Nobody can ignore the fact that our generation is blessed with several technical advancements. These advancements have both pros and cons of which the cons are on rapid rise. It can be easily observed that several people have bad digital habits. This includes not just students or adults but also professionals working in this sector.With the Internet of Things in the market, gadgets will soon outnumber people on Earth. As responsible netizens, we must get rid of these habits to make cyberspace a better place. I am sure that everyone will be able to relate to a few habits listed below. Note that these bad digital habits can easily be avoided.\nNo data backup\nNothing in cyberspace is bulletproof. Every device is vulnerable to attacks and intrusions. Your data can also be affected by hardware failures, power surges, malware or viruses and even ransomware. The best way to get rid of this habit is to start creating physical backups to a hard disk for all your documents. Using cloud storage to back up your data is also a good option.\nAddiction to Pornography\nRelationship problems, depression or secrecy are a few of the issues that this habit creates. Almost 3/4th of the young generation watch porn. The best way to close the curtains on this habit is to make use of internet filters.\nSocial Media Platforms\nA lot of people today are addicted to social media. Although social media platforms add value to our lives, they turn out to be a waste of time when used obsessively. One way to stop this bad digital habit is to download the “StayFocused” app from the Chrome store. It denies you access to websites which waste your time.\nObsession with Online Gaming\nWell, this bad habit doesn’t actually have a cure but it cannot be curtailed until and unless you don’t have self-control.\nBad E-mail Etiquettes\nEven if you are not an employee you can unknowingly offend someone by this digital habit. Bad e-mail etiquette includes ignoring e-mails, replying to e-mails at the wrong time, requesting read receipts and many more. Hence, always ensure that your e-mails look professional and perfect.Technology cannot be held liable for any bad digital habit. We are on the wrong side of it. So why not get rid of these 5 bad digital habits at least? "

    "data": "We are happy to share via this post what a few readers might know. On 28th July 2015, we received the award for the Cyber Blogger of the Year 2015 at the National Conference on Cyber Crime Control jointly organized by the Asian School of Cyber Laws, Home Department (Government of Maharashtra), Mumbai Police Cyber Crime Wing and IIT Bombay. Started in December 2014, we were just a blog. Today with other things that we are doing, we have become the portal that we dreamt to become. On behalf of the entire team of The Cyber Blog India, I would like to thank all our readers, WhatsApp subscribers, Social Media followers and people who have attended our workshops. The event was graced by the presence of the Home Minister of Maharashtra, Dr. Ranjit Patil and it is from him that we received the award. Rachiyta and I received this award on behalf of #TheCBI. The team of bloggers that received this award includes Rachiyta Jain, Arpan Sinha, Ravi Kant and me. Among other things that we are doing right now are a WhatsApp service helpline, Workshops and Surveys. In my experience of working for The Cyber Blog India, I have come to the conclusion that people start mass movements about court cases, food bans and weird challenges. What is needed today in India is a viral and widespread movement about cyber awareness. Speaking of Digital India and Literacy, we may be able to achieve it in the next couple of years but are we going to look at Awareness, Safe Usage and Cyber Security after that? Why can’t there be a hashtag about cyber awareness that trends and people just don’t talk about safer authentication and passwords but actually implement them? Is it not all in our hands?If you are reading this post, we implore you to share and spread the word of cyber awareness in whatever parts of your demographic you can. There is the online India that we see tweeting about #DigitalIndiaMission but there is a bigger chunk still offline that is highly impacted by it. People are using plastic money and falling victims to the most common frauds just for the lack of awareness. If you are aware and smart, there is definitely nothing better, but this knowledge will be of use only if it spreads. Governments, Organizations and individuals, everybody is looking at a crackproof system and it is a fact that nobody has that system yet. Do not say and preach, “Nobody can hack me”. Learn the ethics of Data Keeping and what needs to be online and what not even in the most hidden and private form. "

    "data": "Ever fancied owning a smartwatch? Or do you own one? Well, you might be stunned after knowing that these wearable devices pose a lot of security risks. Smart watches, smart bands, and even wireless panels can pose a threat to your online identity. Moreover, these are devices gaining remote access to the stuff in your smartphones or computers, referred to as IoT (Internet of Things) devices. However, according to HP, they don’t provide the same level of security.HP did an assessment of 10 different smartwatches and smart bands having different specifications, along with their respective mobile and computer applications. Subsequently, they found out that each one of them had some issues that could make it vulnerable. Every smartwatch collects personal data including name, date of birth, location etc, but none of them has an effective way to keep this information secure. 90% of the cases display that the information retrieved from a smartwatch is easy to intercept. Furthermore, more than 40% of these smartwatches have firmware that can easily leak away the information, the study suggested.Smartwatches and other wearables primarily pose the risk at two levels, which are as follows:Device level: Most of the smartwatches tested by HP had various insecurities related to the device’s firmware. None of the devices had a two-factor authentication, or the ability to lock the device after a number of failed attempts.Transit level: At the transport layer, while transmitting the data between the host device and the smartwatch, the assessed smartwatches lacked a strong cypher. In four out of ten cases, they could easily decipher the encryption of the transmitted data.“The combination of account enumeration, weak passwords, & lack of account lockout means 30 per cent of watches and their applications were vulnerable to account harvesting, allowing attackers to guess login credentials and gain access to user accounts,” Daniel Miessler, the lead researcher of this study said. He also suggested, “it will be a matter of creating policies for managing IoT and wearables within the enterprise, whether that’s creating isolated segments on the LAN, determining what types of devices and capabilities are allowed in sensitive corporate areas.”Image source: Phonearena"

    "headline": "Here’s how to have Safe Online Transactions",
    "data": "There is a huge number of vulnerabilities in the online space today. This post is specifically about vulnerabilities in online transactions. The frequency and number of online transactions have seen a steep increase. In India, the Jan Dhan Yojna (National Scheme for Financial Inclusion) has offered bank accounts and debit cards to everyone, even the digital illiterate. This has created a larger population which is majorly unaware and at risk of falling victim to crimes like phishing, vishing and E-Wallet hacking. Not much needs to be said about the sad part of the story which is that there is a lack of awareness even in the digital era that we are so proudly talking about.Who doesn’t like to use Paytm, Freecharge, Mobikwik and other such services to recharge? I’m talking regular transactions like once a week or so. Of course, I bet if you are reading this post you have used one of these wallets or at least some service to recharge your phone & DTH connection, book bus tickets, buy a mobile case on Flipkart, order a phone via Snapdeal or buy a Tshirt from some other store. If you have been using debit cards, it is a smart move right now to switch. And if you have used your debit card and saved your card details on an E-wallet account while checking out, What in the world were you thinking?As a responsible netizen, do away with using debit cards for online transactions for two reasons, one, they will cost you extra money once the monthly allowance of transactions is over. Two, they can be a security loophole you create yourself.Honestly speaking, we cannot say if even Internet Banking is too secure. There are all sorts of attacks there as well. There could be phishing attacks or even a non-trusted website that you enter your details on and as a result, you could expose your entire bank account.Whatever you do an online transaction for, create a virtual card. This virtual card is just like any other debit card and has been around for more than 3 years. It will have its own card details that a regular debit card does.The interesting part is that it expires as soon as the transaction is completed or if the card is cancelled or not used for 48 hours after creation*. For now, as confirmed State Bank of India, ICICI Bank, HDFC, Kotak and some other third-party service providers offer this service to create virtual cards (Visa Card right now*) for a minimum value of Rs. 500 and a maximum of Rs. 50,000.Suppose you have to buy merchandise worth Rs. 3250, your login to your Internet Banking service (Which you are of course sure that it is a safe webpage). For example www.onlinesbi.com), and create a virtual card with the amount of Rs. 3250. When you move to payment on the vendor’s website you purchase from, choose a debit card and enter the details as generated by your Internet Banking Service. The money is paid and neither your Internet Banking Account gets revealed through this process nor does your real debit card. Similar services are available from different banks and third parties with many customization options.\nDon’t worry the card in the screenshot won’t work anymore. 🙂* Specifically for State Bank of India Virtual Cards for this post"

The meeting was supposed to be a casual get-together with Rakshit Sir, but talks led us to discuss crucial issues and we said, “Why not a Q&A for our readers on the spot?”. Rakshit Sir, like the spontaneous man he is agreed to share his experience and insight about some general questions and problems faced by common people. Following is a transcript of the entire interview. We promise you will enjoy reading it as much as we enjoyed talking to him.The very first thing to keep in mind is that whatever is happening to you, don’t destroy the evidence i.e. messages, emails, photographs screenshots etc. We often get so scared that we delete all this data so that no one finds out. Immediately after this, if you have a cyber crime cell in your city report the crime. And if you don’t have a cyber crime cell report to any gazetted officer of SP rank and file a written complaint. The intensity of crime should not be a worry. Whether 1000 rupees are stolen or a lakh or an embarrassing/naked picture of yours has been put up on the Internet, you should always attempt to convert the complaint into an FIR with valid sections stated there.In cases where you are not the victim and you just know a crime is happening and you wish to report such crimes (eg. calls from a fake number, a fake website used to arm people), ICERT is the best body to do so. Its website has an option to report an incident, where you can send the report. As a responsible citizen, you must report any calls from any fake number to the service provider. If the crime is on a good social media platform such as YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and Twitter, they have a strong reporting feature. Moreover, they take serious actions strictly. You can report the person and block the person from your social media.In case of banking fraud, don’t just report to the bank, also tell the police and file an FIR.  A lot of banks say “We are investigating”. That is wrong. The bank is not a law enforcement agency. Until and unless you don’t file a police complaint there is no guarantee that your money will come back. So do both things together.This crime you are talking about is mostly related to women. I would really like to appreciate the efforts taken by UP Police which is called Women Power line 1090. They have 100% anonymity of the complainant and take action on valid grounds. I have also been working as a consultant and they have started taking complaints about WhatsApp, Facebook stalking, selfies and all such similar problems.  Police file an FIR against the boy and then nab him. This has happened and is happening also. But otherwise, I am sorry, after filing the FIR, even if the person is 18+ i.e. an adult, there is no issue for parents coming to know about it. However, the problem is police come to your home for investigation and everything. So you should have an address to give. If you are a child filing complaints, your parent or guardian must involve themselves. I remember a case where the girl said if her parents found out they would put an end to her schooling, so a very good teacher of hers supported her and came forth as a guardian to file the complaint. I think such kinds of problems require more sensitivity. And now, since its increase in number and volume, the Government will definitely give an eye to it and create a plan to maintain the anonymity of a young victim.  Another fear in a child’s mind is that the law isn’t so strong and the criminal will go to jail today come out tomorrow and be more revengeful because getting bail is very easy. Therefore a good justice/lawyer/advocate etc will be able to tell better how to face this problem.Google and Facebook announced that they will strictly remove revenge porn. Moreover, they created a special page for the same. If somebody’s revenge porn is coming in the search they can fill out the form and Google will pull it down immediately.  This is from the part of the Information Service Provider. The problem is it is very difficult to pull down what goes on millions of websites at once. Today a girl clicked her photo and sent it with consent to her bf. Tomorrow, we cannot tell which source leaked the photo.  Then it goes on hundreds of groups on WhatsApp, Facebook and YouTube.  It is not possible to track these thousand people and arrest them. On Facebook, yes you can track easily and arrest the person even liking or sharing.  The law relating to this should be very strict according to me because people are not afraid at all. Everyone shares their photo publicly anybody’s photo these days. Though we have 67B and POCSO, I am not sure if that is very effective.I never thought of the section as being misused and a source of big fear for so many. It would make people think before they would write anything. But naturally looking at past cases, they did misuse the section and I think removal was OK. But now, we require a substitute. There is no word like cyber defamation today. If somebody wishes to write wrong about anybody he will get a shield saying I have a freedom to speech. If somebody gives me a threatening call or email saying he will kill me, I cannot book him under 66A anymore which previously I could because of the word “criminal intimidation.” Today I will have to take the support of IPC but then I am showing electronic evidence without any support of the IT Act.  These are the kinds of problems that are there. Now they have removed it because of its misuse and inappropriate language. “Anything that causes annoyance,”  is obnoxious.   Amending it was a better option of course and if not create a new one again with proper terminology. Incorporate terms like cyberbullying and defamation. The government must fill that gap soon.Yes, that was one of my concerns too. People who are digitally illiterate have an account. My objection is whether there was KYC done. And where is the guarantee that these accounts are not for legal funding and illegal purposes?The user security is zero. How will a maid use plastic money when she doesn’t know how to use a cell phone? Even educated people don’t know how to use it safely, what can you expect from this poor lady? She will give her card to someone and ask them to take out cash for her. One of the banks took the initiative to formulate safety measures but that was only in English. I think it should come up in multiple languages. Even other banks should send messages in regional languages saying “no sharing of PINs”, nobody does verification on the phone, nobody blocks your card except us and we can only do that if it is from a legal authority etc. TVs, newspapers and the lot must popularize them on a large scale wherever possible.From a hacker’s perspective, every system is breachable. So your real protector can be the kind of data science that the breach has used. My idea of encryption is randomising data rather than storing it logically. That gives good security to the database.  Only relevant data is visible in such cases.Anything which goes online against the country amounts to cyber terrorism. For me, cyber terrorism is online drug-peddling, arms & human trafficking, online gambling and disrespect to Nationalism of course. It’s a broad spectrum.  The initial way to look at it is that we are a secular country and these terrorists use cyberspace to create unnecessary rumours, send instigating messages or recruit and brainwash young minds. Intelligence agencies must conduct social media monitoring. Recently, the police arrested a guy from Bangalore for using Twitter to support ISIS terrorism. The Government must take such matters seriously."

    "data": "A video has recently gone viral about Samsung’s “secret chip” that breaches your privacy. It allegedly is stuck on the battery and it accesses your private videos and pictures and dumps them on to Samsung Servers. Preachers of this weird wild theory have also brought some other vendors into the limelight by saying that these secret chips upload the data even without the user getting to know about it. If Non techies believe it, it is justified to an extent I guess but the irony is that even people majoring in Technology are sharing this video. The certification and standardization authorities are definitely sane enough to not let a vendor ship devices with a “chip” that breaches users’ privacy.Towards the end of the video, it is urged that people do the same pomp and show and spread the word. Also that they open their Samsung mobiles, tear down the battery and remove this “chip”.Img Source: iFixitIt is an NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna that is built into the battery to enable data transfer on a tap to turn on there NFC enabled devices. I’m not highlighting the details too much, if you like to read, search the Internet about NFC and know more. What I want to mention here is the fact that all the users who have been doing this exercise, please know that that you are actually tearing apart the NFC chip.\nWe request you to not share the video anywhere.

How about using a touch screen “touch” pattern (Mind you, no drawing of patterns) or a volume button combination pattern to unlock your applications?Yes, it is possible with the help of just another app. Oops AppLock is this security application that lets you lock applications on your phone and unlock them using a pattern which you press the volume buttons with. It is a free and a clever application on the Google Play Store. Why it is clever is because after installation if you try to find OopsLock on your phone, you will only have a hard time. It shows up in your appdrawer as well as in list of applications as K Note and interestingly when you open it, it just looks like a simple note taking app. Here you can set up a new password. By default you would need to press the volume up button 3 times, which will open the actual app. In some devices this support can even extend to a pattern you touch your screen with.You can manage what apps to lock or not here. Each app can be assigned a different lock.\nTo add to all this, you can even set a splash screen for any locked application i.e. the screen that users will be greeted with when they open that application. So, lets suppose you are using messenger, you can click a snapshot and put it as the splash screen. To somebody who doesn’t know it will look like a frozen phone while it’s your lock screen, waiting for you to enter the password.\nOfcourse it cannot be regarded as an amazingly secure solution but it is a step ahead of text based passwords and abstraction of the lock screen itself. If you are going to be using it for a long time, go gentle on the volume buttons!IMGSOURCE: http://www.androidauthority.com/oops-applock-review-567574/"

    "data": "Facebook announces that it has introduced a new feature which will let the users add OpenPGP encryption keys to their profile so that Facebook can encrypt the emails it sends to them. Facebook has taken various steps in the past to ensure security to a certain level, such as running connections over HTTPS and a Tor onion site, but this one will make sure that the notification emails sent to users by Facebook are properly encrypted.PGP (Pretty Good Privacy) is an encryption standardization. When a hacker tries to do crypt-analysis, he notices the pattern of the encrypted text. PGP compresses the data making it impossible to study the correct patterns. Compressing the data also reduces the size thus making it easier and faster to transport the data. A session key is generated after this based on your pattern of keyboard and mouse movements. It is a one-time key and unique to all. This session key is used to encrypt the compressed data. After this the session key that was used is encrypted using RSA algorithm. For this encryption the receiver’s public key is used. The encrypted data and key is then sent to the receiver. Click here for an info-graphic on PGP, and here to know how to set it up on your emails.To update a public key, click here:https://www.facebook.com/me/about?section=contact-infoIt will look like this: Enter the key in the space provided, and click on save changes.

    "headline": "Bodies Working for Cyber Security: The Cyber Appellate Tribunal",
    "data": "With cyber crime rate on the roll across India, several organisations; both Government and private are working to help combat it.  Along with the knowledge about these happenings it is quite necessary that one knows where to approach. The Department of Electronics and Information Technology (DeitY) recognizes a few such as Cyber Appellate Tribunal, National Informatics Centre and Indian Computer Emergency Response Team. In this post we are going to talk about the Cyber Appellate Tribunal.The Cyber Appellate TribunalEstablished according to provisions under Section 48(1) of the IT Act, Cyber Appellate Tribunal (further referred to as CAT) was first established in October 2006 in New Delhi.  Present under the guidance of Controller of Certifying Authorities (C.C.A) it is the only CAT in the country. Cyber Appellate Tribunal is vested with the same powers as with the civil court under the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 but at the same time guided by the principles of natural justice. The Cyber Appellate Tribunal has powers to regulate its own procedure including the place at which it has its sittings. Every proceeding before the Cyber Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the meaning of sections 193 (punishment for false evidence and when a trial/investigation/enquiry is considered a judicial proceeding) and 228(intentional insult or interruption to public servant sitting in judicial proceeding) of the Indian Penal Code and for the purposes of section 196 (using evidence known to be false) of the Indian Penal Code. The Cyber Appellate Tribunal shall be deemed to be a civil court for the purposes of section 195(prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence) and Chapter XXVI of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973.Any person not satisfied with the decision of adjudicating officer appointed under Sec.46 of the IT ACT, 2008 can  appeal before the Tribunal within 45 days of receiving a copy of the order given by Controller or the Adjudicating Officer. The Cyber Appellate Tribunal allows you to file a case online if you are a Legal Practitioner, petitioners-in-person or an authorised agent, the procedure for which can be read over here. Also, you can directly approach the tribunal in person.As described under Section 49 of IT Act 2008, the Chairperson of the Tribunal is to head it and other such members as appointed by Central Government by notification in the Official Gazette may help in the process. A review of Functioning of the Offices of the State Adjudicating Officers and Cyber Appellate Tribunal by Centre for Internet and Society shows[1],“A second branch of the Tribunal was to be set up in Bangalore, no efforts seem to have been made in this regard. Further, the position of the Chairperson of the Appellate Tribunal, has been left vacant since 2011, after the appointed Chairperson attained the age of superannuation and retired. Although judicial and technical members have been appointed at various points, the tribunal cannot hold hearings without a chairperson. A total of 17 judgements have been passed by the Cyber Appellate Tribunal prior to the retirement of the chairperson, while the backlog of cases is continuously growing. Despite a writ petition being filed before the Karnataka High Court and the secretary of the Department of IT coming on record to state that the Chairperson would be appointed within 6 months (of September 2013), no action seems to have been taken in this regard, and the lacunae in the judicial mechanism under the IT Act continues.”Being a major dispute resolution body of cyber crime related issues, a serious effort by the Government should be made to bring the Tribunal back to track. Also more Tribunals should be established across country to keep the system active because we need to make the people of nation believe, that future of India is cyber secure and justice is not  distant dream."

    "data": "Have you ever come across such a thing before?!You must be wondering how will this thing decide whether you’re a robot or not? You just have to click, and a bot can easily click, right? Well, here’s the answer.CAPTCHAs have long relied on the inability of bots to solve distorted text. However, according to Google, the current level of Artificial Intelligence can easily solve primitive CAPTCHA. Therefore, they’ve given an even better and improved option, the reCAPTCHA.As the name suggests, reCAPTCHA takes into account the entire engagement of CAPTCHA of a user to determine whether the user is actually a human or not. Thus this is a more effective tool against robots.Google, also claims that reCAPTCHA offers more than just spam protection. “Every time our CAPTCHAs are solved, that human effort helps digitize text, annotate images, and build machine-learning datasets. This in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.”  The reCAPTCHA is easy for people and tough for bots.  It has many advantages.Advanced Security: Since reCAPTCHA uses your previous records of how you’ve solved CAPTCHAs, and then verifies you as a human, thus security has reached the next level. According to Google, “reCAPTCHA is for security. Armed with state-of-the-art technology, it always stays at the forefront of spam and abuse fighting trends. reCAPTCHA is on guard for you, so you can rest easy.”Ease of Use: Users just have to click a button to prove that they’re not robots, thus it is very easy to use. According to Google, “Purposefully designed. And actively aware. reCAPTCHA knows when to be easy on people and hard on bots. Our easy CAPTCHAs are a breeze for legitimate users.”Creation of Value: Not only does it use your previous records, but also applies the human bandwidth to benefit people everywhere, according to Google. According to them, “Millions of CAPTCHAs are solved by people every day. reCAPTCHA makes positive use of this human effort by channelling the time spent solving CAPTCHAs into digitizing text, annotating images, and building machine-learning datasets. This in turn helps preserve books, improve maps, and solve hard AI problems.”   "

And if you haven’t, it is a great trick to identify the horrid applications that slow down your computer’s performance. Try killing the process that is eating up a lot of memory, and it will help ease a lot of burden off the machine.If you dig deeper, it is the RAM that the app is killing. To elaborate, people have started calling Chrome, the RAM killer; which is true. If you open 30-40 tabs in Chrome like I do most of the time or even a good 15-20 your computer is going to slow down and it is evident in the processes when you open your task manager.I tried that too, yes! I switched over to Firefox and Opera and even tried Safari but with the kind of habit that I have, there is no use for at least 20 tabs at once. Then I came across this chrome extension called The Great Suspender which is very easy to use and solves the purpose.You just need to download and install this extension from the above link in Chrome. Once installed, you can manually suspend a tab. You can also go to the settings and set the time limit and preferences for the suspension of the tabs. Now suspending tabs lets them be there but kind of makes them sleep right like they were. Once you switch to that tab again, it will wake up just where it slept. While this is still a burden on your Internet connection, it eases the load on the RAM. There is also a whitelist of applications which the extension will not suspend. There are simple hotkeys also which you can remap according to your wishes. For example, you can map a simple hotkey such as  Ctrl+Shift+S to manually suspend a tab.  \n \n"

Law Commission of India took a leap into cyberspace by announcing its presence on the most popular social networking websites under the following names:Facebook: Law Commission of IndiaTwitter: lawcomindiaYouTube: Law Commission of IndiaNot only this, the Law Commission of India has a logo specially designed for this purpose.The Commission in its report said,“A good percentage of the urban Indian population is active on one or other social media website. The Law Commission of India would also like to be part of this growing trend In order to make its presence more prevalent.”The report clearly depicts the Commission’s intention to make its existence felt at a wider scale and get a first-hand opinion of the public on its policies.In my opinion, I believe the population prefers to be more socially active than mentally active. Being a critique of anything and everything on a social platform is the new “cool.”   When a stupefied comment pops over their screen, such people work their asses off to understand it.  When it’s beyond the capacity of their so-called brains, they try to save their  “oh so precious social image” by ramparting other like-minded people who are unaware of their own online actions. This depicts how the mentally lethargic world works today.\nAs long as we can keep such nonsensical revolutions and opinions at bay, people who think they can change the world sitting behind their PC screens will bring a more positive change. It just depends on how active the Commission stays. After all, the zeal with which the Indian Government works never persists till the end in the long run.  Time will be a better judge of that. For now, we can just hope the good work continues.Read the report :   "

    "headline": "Legal Implications of Fake Profiles and How to spot one",
    "data": "A—”Hey, how many friends have you got on Facebook?”B—”Ummm… 2000, maybe?”A—”Fakes in there?”B—”What? I don’t know, who cares?”“So what?”These Facebook accounts may be human or bots, popularly known as social bots that keep creating fake accounts and many researchers are on the hunt to track them down. Consequently, they spread spam and viruses or dupe users to steal their data or very recently, to lure people into some modelling sham and then ultimately to get them trafficked or robbed. Moreover, you never know if you are vulnerable. Therefore, the best deal is to stay away from these profiles and don’t ever create one yourself.We’ll deal with two things here: 1) Legal Implications of Creating a fake profile in India; and 2) How to spot a fake profile.Firstly, your best shot is to run a Google search for the image. Using this simple reverse engineering technique, you can bust a fake profile. However, if that does not work,  your subsequent other means are to be investigative and stalk the wall, photos, friends and behaviour on the ID. If you notice a fake ID, be sure to report it.Just Identity Theft:\nIf you ever face a situation where your identity has been stolen (could be your photograph used on a social media network and by your name), you can always remember that Section 66C of the IT Act is the saviour. Furthermore, if the authority you reach out to does not know this, your knowledge of your legal rights can help you. This section attracts 3 years of imprisonment. Section 66C gives you the protection from forging “electronic signature, password or any other unique identification feature”.Includes Cheating:\nIn this case, you can use Section 468 of the IPC and Section 66D of the IT Act. The punishment under Section 468 can be up to 7 years. Now consider the scenario that you are the CEO of XYZ company and someone creates a profile in your name and offers a job for some consideration to anyone. If you find this out you must go to the Police to file an FIR under these two sections. Because cheating has a very wide scope, the punishment for cheating in such a case is 7 years. Hence, you can use this to your advantage.“Whoever commits forgery, intending that the [document or electronic record forged] shall be used for the purpose of cheating…”—Section 2(1)(t) of the IT Act defines electronic records as “data, record or data generated, image or sound”. Hence, this includes voice biometrics or stuff like that apart from just images.Subsequently, to invoke defamation, note that:The IT Act doesn’t correlate identity theft and defamation. They are mentioned independently;You can use sections 66E, 67, and 67A of the IT Act for obscene content. Additionally, if you claim defamation under these provisions, the punishment can be as high as 5-7  years. Section 66A as you know is also dead.Sections 499 and 500 of the IPC clearly talk about defamation and the punishment is 2 years. Furthermore, you can invoke section 464 of the IPC to raise the punishment bar to 3 years if the perpetrator committed forgery.To read this article in Hindi, click here. | इस आर्टिकल को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। "

    "headline": "Are Security Questions Secure Enough To Protect Your Account?",
    "data": "Well, the answer according to Google Security blogger Elie Bursztein, is a straight “No.” Security questions, according to the blog, are either easy to remember or secure, but rarely both. More than 75% of people prefer the former making them vulnerable to hackers. Popular websites, like Yahoo, Hotmail, and even Facebook rely on security questions to retrieve lost passwords. Sometimes these questions are used as an additional layer of security against suspicious login attempts, but the effectiveness of these questions is seldom questioned.Yahoo-Canada’s account retrieval through security questionQuestions, like “What is your favourite food?” are very easy to guess. In fact, “favourite food” is the most common question set by a user, apart from how easy it is to guess. According to Google Security Blog, 19.7% of answers were “Pizza.” According to them, 37% of people intentionally provide false answers that are still easy to guess. This is because the people who try to crack down on these questions think in the way the users must have.Though difficult questions are safer, they are very difficult to remember. An average internet user answers 2 security questions a year, so if you’ve set a difficult question, you’ll certainly forget it in 6 long months. In fact, the blog also presented statistical data supporting this argument, according to which 40% of American citizens forgot what their security questions were, let alone the answers.Thankfully, there are some solutions to it.The most secure of all is the 2-factor authentication. After you’ve answered your security question and set a new password, you have to log in again. And when you do it, it is where the 2-factor authentication comes into play. After clicking the “login” button, your device asks for a PIN, which automatically changes after every fixed interval. Hence, even if someone cracked your security question, they can’t log in unless without the pin.Another option, according to what the blog said, is for the site owners. They must have some OTP sent over in the form of SMSs or e-mails along with the questions.A bit less safe option is having multiple security questions. Having two questions instead of one greatly reduces the risk. If two easy questions have a guessing probability in ten attempts of 25% each, then the possibility of guessing them together reduces to a whopping 2%.Beutler_Google_passwords"

    "data": "\nMalware is a silent killer. Most of us see them as something harmless. Moreover, the majority of the time we don’t even realise that it affects our system. This is so because its effects seem similar to that of a hardware malfunction.Malware as the name suggests stands for “MALicious softWARE.” It is specially designed to reside silently on your system, gain access to it and steal sensitive data.A virus is a subset of malware. Malware along with viruses encompasses spyware, worms, adware, trojans etc. Ransomware is one of the latest forms of malware that restricts you from accessing your system till you pay the fees.Unlike viruses, your antivirus software cannot detect all malware. It remains camouflaged in a very basic form right before your eyes. Here are just a few examples that may suggest that your PC has been compromised[1]:You may receive the error “Internet Explorer could not display the page” when attempting to access certain websites.Your web browser (e.g., Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox, Google Chrome) freezes, hangs or is unresponsive.Your web browser’s default homepage is changed (eg. automatically directed to delta search, wise search etc.).Blocked access to security-related websites.You get redirected to web pages other than the one you intended to go to.You receive numerous web browser popup messages.Strange or unexpected toolbars appear at the top of your web browser.Your computer runs slower than usual.Your computer freezes, hangs or is unresponsive.There are new icons on your desktop that you do not recognise.Your computer restarts by itself (but not a restart caused by Windows Updates).You see unusual error messages (e.g., messages saying there are missing or corrupt file folders).You are unable to access the Control Panel, Task Manager, Registry Editor or Command Prompt.Prevention is better than cure. Ensure the following to keep malware at bay:Keep your anti-virus up to date and scan the system occasionally.Keep your System updated. Have the “automatic update” feature turned on.Do not click on ads or unnecessary links while surfing the web.Do not open emails which do not seem to be from a genuine source.Use personal firewalls. Most of the Windows systems have built-in firewalls turned on by default.Despite the precautions, if you are still a victim of a malware attack do not take it lightly. There are free tools such as Malwarebytes anti-malware, RKILL, HitmanPro, AdwCleaner etc. which can help clean your system. For Windows users, Microsoft offers its own service which does a free security scan for you. You can also download the Microsoft Malicious Software Removal Tool which does the job of wiping away certain specific malware.  Click here to read this post about Malware removal on Windows.[1] http://malwaretips.com/blogs/malware-removal-guide-for-windows/"

    "headline": "Using Virtual Machines? Beware of VENOM",
    "data": "VENOM is a security vulnerability in floppy drive codes in various virtual computer platforms. It is a backronym for Virtualized Environment Neglected Operations Manipulation, which basically means that in a virtual machine, there are some neglected operations, i.e. the virtual floppy drive codes, which have been manipulated and hence are causing the guest platform to literally break out and affect the host machine.A Virtual Machine (VM) is the guest that runs upon the physical host computer. The guest has no clue about the host and/or other guest machines. It considers itself an all-inclusive computer, but actually, it only has a virtual presence. A VM can run many different operating systems and applications, separated by a virtual layer called “hypervisor”. Hence, this doesn’t affect the real physical computer’s operating system or the applications. Virtualization techniques are generally implemented for sharing servers, running softwares that don’t run on a host, investigating programs that are suspicious, etc.The VENOM vulnerability allows the attacker to step out of the bounds of a VM guest, and potentially obtain access to the host, where it can easily execute any code and could give access to a local network and adjacent guest systems.According to CrowdStrike, the people who discovered this vulnerability, “Abuse of this vulnerability can open access to Intellectual Property (IP), in addition to sensitive and personally identifiable information (PII), potentially impacting thousands of organisations and millions of end users that rely on affected VMs for the allocation of shared computing resources, as well as connectivity, storage, security, and privacy.”This means even if you’re not using a VM, the VENOM vulnerability can affect you. This will happen even if you’re using software which runs a VM to allocate servers, or save data. You must be wondering what to do now? Well, there’s nothing we can do now, except for taking precautions. Follow these steps to avoid the risk to some extent:Regularly update your Virtual Machine software, especially if it’s based on QEMU (Quick Emulator). VirtualBox, Xen and KVM are some examples of QEMU-based Virtual Machines. Various patches are available which guarantee a certain level of security. Install them.Ask your cloud service providers to regularly patch up their softwares.Keep looking for updates on the VENOM vulnerability.And keep using Virtual Machines if you’re using them now. They’re too useful to abandon.image source: http://venom.crowdstrike.com/"

    "data": "The manual lock is no good in today’s world. Due to the presence of a locksmith everywhere, the task of getting a duplicate key is child’s play. In times like these, all of us have shown a high level of faith in the fancy number locks. It’s not like we believe in what fancy locks have got to offer. However, they are probably 5% better and much more sophisticated than the traditional ones.I can’t say about sophistication but security is something we all need to rethink about. The Combo Breaker is a motorized, battery-powered, 3D-printed, Arduino-based device that can crack any Master combination locks in less than 30 seconds. You can easily break a lock in less than 8 tries. It is a simple device that anyone can build. Combo Breaker uses a simple program. This program exploits the manufacturing flaw of the combination disks present in the lock that has a different sort of resistance to certain numbers. What it does is not very different from a brute force attack used to crack passwords on a system.

    "data": "Have you ever wondered if your text messages might be at risk? Text messages use server-based peer-to-peer messaging techniques, which means that the server’s database stores all your text messages, which can compromise your data and identity. Moreover, along with your identity, your messages too are at risk.According to BitTorrent, their new advent, Bleep will rule out the chances of such threats. It uses server-less communication. Your phone stores your texts in an image form, and not on any cloud or server. According to Farid Fadaie from BitTorrent, “Since our open alpha release last September, a lot has happened in the private messaging space. Services have come and gone, some have been breached and patched, and in many cases, users have been left feeling violated, or at the very least, changed what they say or do online. There have been various costs involved, which we have to cut down. We’ve decided that one of those costs should not be your identity.” After downloading the Bleep app, you must enter a nickname to verify your email address. The verification part is optional but it will help you locate your friends. You can also invite people with the help of a special key they provide. The messaging has two modes, which you can easily switch while in a conversation. One is normal messaging; and the other is the whisper mode, where you can send pictures which will be visible only for 25 seconds, just like Snapchat. The app also lets you call like every other app. However, despite the fact that there is no end-to-end encryption, it is still safe. Bleep also has a desktop version. Hence, you can access your messages on your Windows PC or a Mac laptop. This is how the application’s interface on an Android phone looks like:image source: Google Play Storeimage source: Google Play Storeimage source: Google Play Store "

Earlier you had to enter your username and password together on the same page. The new login change now separates these two events. After entering your password a second page opens as Google claims. Read more about Google’s announcement here.Now what it has caused is a lot of annoyance to people using different password managers. Users of LastPass have commented on the forum about how much they are disliking the new update and its lack of support for auto-fill. LastPass is however working to fix it soon. Other users are willing to give up  Google’s services for the time it’s now wasting.\nAccording to Google, the change in the system is for “preparation for future authentication solutions” and a better experience for university students and corporate users who sign in with a different identity provider than Google. Now if there is going to be any high-end security implementation in the sign-in process, I’m not sure, but Google is definitely making a lot of customers angry.For the time being, if you do not like the new login screen, you can log in via accounts.google.com or accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin and it still show you the old screen, Type in gmail.com and it will take you to the new login. Multiple login pages exist as of now maybe due the lack of support. Opera still shows the old login page on gmail.com. What Google is up to is fairly unclear. But from the responses that people are giving, nobody literally seems to be happy or at ease about it.\nAnd if you are the one who is always logged in with your email ID, please change the habit.\n"

This software waits for a change in your USB port, and as soon as it is made, it automatically shuts down. So now don’t worry about forgetting your logged-on-computer in a public place, if you have this software enabled. USBKill might not appeal to you now, but it is no doubt a boon for those who have to keep their work private and wish to secure their data. Don’t compare it with the “USB Killer” that explodes the computer when it is plugged into the device. Though its developer, Hephaestos (@h3phaestos) made this for criminals who want to keep their data secure from the law, it can be very helpful for us too. Using this software, you can even prevent backdoor viruses or any malware through USB. According to the developer, large corporate levels can also protect their servers from any threat through USB. Don’t forget to use disk encryption along with this, to keep your data even more secure. You can even set up a BIOS password, and a syskey password as well. How? Click here to know.The following are its features according to the developer:It’s compatible with Mac OS X, Windows 8, and Linux.It is customizable, i.e. it executes a list of defined operations before the shutdown.Low memory consumption.You can whitelist a USB, which means you can have some USB ports on which this won’t work, and can keep only a few ports for USBKill.On shutdown, you can even melt the program.It isn’t dependent on any software or language except for Python 2/3.You can view its details, and maybe download it later here. The software is currently under development, so you cannot download it just yet."

    "headline": "Historic piracy injunction for Piku: Don’t try to download the movie",
    "data": "Did you know that piracy is a serious crime? The Delhi High Court granted restraining orders against websites and cable operators from streaming, broadcasting or publishing online the film “Piku” without permission. Justice Indermeet Kaur of the Delhi High Court passed this interim order on the movie producers’ plea. This was done as a proactive step to prevent “irreparable damage that might occur to them”. The Court issued notices to ISPs, cable operators, websites etc. In addition, it has ordered ISPs to block access to certain websites that were mentioned along with the plea and any that would be communicated in the future.I am sure most of you are looking for a good “720p” or “1080p” print of Piku on one of your torrent search engines. It is a practice a lot of people partake in. Needless to mention, piracy is a crime. And the irony is that almost all (even illegally, mostly theatre print) “downloaded movies” show this kind of commercial. But people are reckless in ascertaining their point of view.“So what?”, “Tujhe kya”, “Mera Internet hai”, “Tell me if you want it?”, “Hume kon pakdega?”, “Sab Karte hain”. India has surfaced as one of the biggest hubs of piracy, be it the 50 rupee Movie combo DVD at Palika or some torrent website. If you think it is not possible to find you, please give up the notion. In 2012, the Kerala police tracked down more than 1,000 people in an anti-piracy drive for pirating a Malayalam movie. For the typical mockery, “Eh why doesn’t the Government do anything?”, significant changes have been made in the law (Copyright Act 2012) to combat piracy.The only reason that India has not been able to successfully ban these services is because their servers rest outside India. Moreover, we don’t have any law to extend our jurisdiction to that extent. As an end user, if you download a pirated version of things, you can face prison for up to 2 years. In the US, such a felony can extend up to 5 years of jail time. The UK, however, mandates the offenders to buy the product that they illegally downloaded.Whether or not the IT Act has an implication here, I would love to have opinions from the readers also. In my opinion, the IT Act has no clear definition of Cinematographic Content Copyright infringement. To add to your knowledge such copyrights have a lifetime of sixty years.No, Not at all. Torrenting encourages peer-to-peer file sharing (Computer to Computer and not server to computer). Even websites like Wikipedia encourage heavy file sharing via torrent so as to lower server loads. If you download open-source software via torrent or share something you aren’t legally bound to, it is perfectly fine. However, the contrary can fall under infringement and effects and be criminal as well as civil. So the best deal is to purchase DVDs and CDs or online if it be. After reading this, you might not stop practising piracy and being a party to it, but remember someone is resolving."

    "data": "Passwords are a very important aspect of the lives of almost everyone, be it a management personnel or a class-10 girl. Though there are various alternatives like retina scan or voice recognition, nothing is more simple and inexpensive than a string of characters.A strong password, as Microsoft defines it, has the following features:It must be more than eight characters long.It mustn’t contain your username, name, or any other personal information that’s known to many.It shouldn’t contain a complete word.It should be way different from your earlier passwords.It should contain at least one character from each of these groups: uppercase letters (A, B, C…), lowercase letters (a,b,c…), numerical characters (1,2,3…), and symbols (!,@,#,$,%…).Even after following the above guidelines, people fail to create a strong password. So here’s a simple trick for creating a strong and easy-to-remember password:Choose a string of letters, such as your place of birth, or your car’s make. Now convert this into numbers corresponding to their alphabetical ranks. For example: “Delhi” would be “4-5-12-8-9”Now choose a combination of numbers you remember, like your phone number, or your PIN code. Convert this into alphabets, again according to the ranks. For example: “22119876” would be “bbaaihgf.”Now place these two strings together in any combination you like. For example, one possible combination is “bba45aih128gf9.” Also add some symbols, like a “)” before the second “b,” and convert some lowercase alphabets into uppercase, like convert “a,” “h,” and “g” into their upper cases, and your new password, “b)bA45AiH128Gf9,” which, according to “How Secure Is My Password?” form, will require 157 billion years to crack. This form is sponsored by RoboForm and is very widely used across the world.There can be numerous ways to keep a strong password, which can easily be remembered and very hard to crack. After you’ve created a strong password, check the strength here. You can also use this tool to check the strength of your password.Just keeping a strong password isn’t enough. In fact, it is the first step towards being safe. A password, no matter how carefully designed, can be useless if shared. And keeping your password to yourself isn’t such an easy task. Here are a few steps that you can follow to reduce the risk of sharing it with anyone:Don’t tell your password to anyone, not even your best friend. Don’t share it through any medium, as it may be compromised.Disable auto-fills as it gives anyone using your PC access to your private stuff, and may even know your password. Never save your passwords on your computers or on your smartphones.Clear the cache every time you use a public computer. It is advisable to change your password as soon as you log into your PC, as public computers are the favourite place for the snoops to hang out. They might be using keystroke-loggers to get hold of your passwords.Never keep a hard version of your password. A hard copy is the most insecure form of saving your password. Instead use a password manager, like RoboForm, LastPass, or BlackBerry Password Keeper (for BlackBerry OS).Keep changing your password after regular intervals because even if someone has gained access to your \npassword, by chance, even then you can remain safe by changing it.Use 2-factor Authentication on all your accounts. In this way, even if someone steals your password, people won’t be able to log in unless they have the OTP generated by the authenticator.

    "data": "Image Source: http://www.christianholz.net/2015-chi15-presentation/Bodyprint-presentation.003.jpg\nPasswords are dying! Companies and individuals are now looking for alternatives. Security is one of the biggest concerns of modern-day Digital India and the world. While the Apple TouchID came about in the midst of such concerns, it needed certain special hardware support. How about something that utilizes what is available in your smartphone and still gives you high-end biometric support? What if it uses your smartphone’s touch screen?Touchscreens were not used for biometrics because the capacitive ones are very low resolution. Hence, capturing the fine whirls of a fingerprint was very tough. Nonetheless, larger prints from the body can be easily taken and this was what required more experimentation.This is what Bodyprint is, an authentication system created by Yahoo Labs that turns a smartphone’s capacitive touchscreen into a biometric scanner. But because the scanning device is much larger than a fingerprint scanner, the system allows smartphone owners to unlock their handsets using body parts other than their fingerprint such as their ear when answering a call. By taking and analysing images of touch patterns on the screen using two-dimensional location mapping, a method by which mobile devices track and process gestures, fingerprints are obtained.“While the input resolution of a touchscreen is about 6 DPI, the surface area is larger, allowing the touch sensor to scan users’ body parts, such as ears, fingers, fists, and palms by pressing them against the display,” the Yahoo Labs team wrote on the project’s web page.The project claims to have a 99.8% precision. This project is so unique and is not just for high-end Android and iOS devices. Even entry-level smartphones can also use this security feature as an app! However, there is still a lot of ambiguity about its launch. Hopefully, this will be in the form of an app that will be compatible with all touchscreen phones.This authentication also applies to the other factors mentioned below, not just the ear. If it comes into the market, it could be one of the breakthroughs in the dimension of authentication accessible to today’s entry-level smartphone users. "

Advertisements, as a result of ad-injectors, are inserted almost everywhere on a webpage, making it challenging to browse through without clicking on them.Google claims to have received more than a whopping 100,000 complaints about such advertisements on their Chrome browser since the beginning of 2015 and has started to work ever since. These injectors are the ones WE actually install on OUR computers but are practically impossible to detect. While downloading your favorite movie, you might have downloaded a .exe file that you didn’t notice; or you must’ve clicked on some deceptive advertisement through which you got it. In fact, there are millions of ways through which you can get ad-injector software on your PC. Google has updated Chrome various times, but there still are some software that find their way through.So, be extra cautious while you download files on your PC, and never run a program file from an untrusted source or a file you don’t even know exists on your hard drive. Though, manually it’s a bit difficult, be vigilant about it. And with that install a popular plug-in, called Ad-block.Open “chrome://extensions/” on your Chrome browser. Then click on “Get More Extensions” on the bottom left of the page.Doing the above step will open the Chrome Store. Search for “AdBlock.”You’ll have a few results like these: Install any of the top 3 plug-ins, approved by Google. We’d recommend the BetaFish Adblocker, as we’ve been using it. This will block all the ads on the page, and if you want to pause it, click on the icon on the right of the address bar, which looks like the one below, and click on “Pause AdBlock.” This will temporarily disable it.So even if you’ve been a victim of Ad-injectors, this will help you avoid it to some extent. If this doesn’t work, disable all other extensions and enable AdBlock again."

In another post, I will tell you how to set up a PGP. It is also called hybrid cryptography as it uses hashing, data compression, symmetric key and public key cryptography.Developed in 1991 by Phil Zimmerman, PGP is used for encrypting and decrypting texts, emails, directories, files and whole disk partitions. It is implemented in the authentication of digital signatures too.A common question that pops into every human mind is what makes PGP better than others? When a hacker tries to do cryptanalysis[1], he deduces the pattern of the encrypted text. PGP compresses the data making it impossible to study the correct patterns. Compressing the data also reduces the size thus making it easier and faster to transport the data. A session key is generated after this based on your pattern of keyboard and mouse movements. It is a one-time-key and unique to all. This session key encrypts the compressed data. After this, the session key gets encrypted through the RSA algorithm. For this encryption, the receiver’s public key is used. The encrypted data and key are then sent to the receiver. This is the encryption process.The decryption is an exactly similar process following a reverse approach. The receiver receives this and uses its private key to decrypt the session key. This session key is then used to decrypt the encrypted ciphertext. The convenience of public key encryption along with the speed of conventional key encryption makes PGP stand out without compromising on security.PGP was not Open Source due to the presence of a patent. Zimmerman convinced IETFT[2], which soon set an OpenPGP standard and opened an OpenPGP Work Group. Today, several developers and companies developing their unique PGP based on this standard, which is proving beneficial for society.[1] trying to study the encrypted data[2]Internet Engineering Task Force"

(Folder mein Folder, New Folder, Hidden Folder Executables and whatnot!)Data Loss: There is nothing as important and expensive as  Data in the world today. Physical Access: Hackers can copy/manipulate files easily by just having physical access to your USB port.Theoretically, as soon as your pen drive is detected by the Operating System, it looks for the autorun file and executes code in it, if the code is malicious there are subsequent repercussions. Hence, what you have to do here is disable public access to the root directory of your pen drive and create a folder where the write operations can happen. Generally, if the root access is not given, you save yourself from a lot of infections.1. Go to Device Manager and locate your pen drive under disks.2. Right-click and go to properties, find the policies tab and select Better Performance.3. Once done, format your drive to the NTFS file system over FAT or FAT32(If you are primarily going to use this drive on Windows)4. Subsequently, create a new folder and name it anything you like,5. Open Command prompt (go to run and type cmd) 6. Type takeown /f G:\\ /r /d y  (Assuming your drive is G, change for whatever your drive is)7. Open the properties of your drive, and navigate to the security tab. Add permissions for “Everyone” to only Read and List Folder contents. 8. Now explore your drive and do the same with the folder you created in step 4. Consequently, you can add permissions to give full control.9. Anyone can write in the folder but not the root.

In case you have any problem setting this up, leave a comment below or find us on any of our social handles.I’m very sure almost all of you have faced this kind of problem at some point in time. New Folder viruses, folders within folders and so much more. Essentially, it happens by exploiting the autorun file that runs on its own once your USB drive is inserted. Thus, in order to protect your PC, you need to stop this autorun activity from automatically happening.In the Run dialog, type regedit to launch the Registry Editor.Depending on whether you want to disable AutoRun for all users or just for the current one, navigate to either of these registry keys (the first one is for all users):HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\Policies\\Explorer\\HKEY_CURRENT_USER\\Software\\Microsoft\\Windows\\CurrentVersion\\policies\\Explorer\\Within this subkey, locate the setting labelled “NoDriveTypeAutoRun”.

The e-mails too had several glitches like this and the personal stuff of the employees.To save them from further embarrassment, the co-CEO, Michael Lynton said:The cyber-attack on Sony Pictures was a malicious criminal act, and we strongly condemn the indexing of stolen employee and other private and privileged information on WikiLeaks. The attackers used the dissemination of stolen information to try to harm SPE and its employees, and now WikiLeaks regrettably is assisting them in that effort.

It offers a 4GB storage capacity to store user details through a dedicated browser interface. A strong master password forms the first factor of authentication, an OTP forms the second factor and to confirm a payment process the key needs to be physically tapped thus completing the third factor.Qkey will help prevent online fraud and increase security greatly. 3 wrong password entries would render the key unusable. Each Qkey is unique to a user. A general question that arises in every human mind is what if one forgets his password. In such a case, uQontrol will have to reset the Qkey. This is a pretty long process because of the need to authenticate every caller making such a claim.Besides online security, the Qkey enhances one’s online shopping experience by feeding details like credit card information, preferred websites and shipping information beforehand. This saves a lot of time. Moreover, the Qkey also connects to mobile using built-in NFC[1].  Currently, it works on Windows interface both on mobile and laptops. Nonetheless, uQontrol has promised to soon make it compatible with MAC, Android and iOS.The Qkey is only available in US markets.

The sense of the word is directly related to the term “morality” as Ethics is the study of morality.It is not a very old term. But until the 1960s, there was nothing known as “computer ethics”. Walter Maner in the mid-’70s introduced the term ‘computer ethics’ which means “ethical problems aggravated, transformed or created by computer technology”. Wiener and Moor have also discussed this in their book—“Computer Ethics identifies and analyses the impacts of Information Technology upon human values like Health, Wealth, opportunity, Freedom, democracy, knowledge, Privacy, security, Self-fulfilment, and so on…“. Since the 1990s, its importance has increased. In simple words, Computer ethics is a set of moral principles that govern the usage of Computers.As we all know, the Computer is an effective technology. It can raise ethical issues like Personal Intrusion, Deception, Breach of Privacy, Cyber-bullying, Cyber-stalking, Defamation, Evasion Technology or social responsibility and Intellectual Property Rights i.e. copyrighted electronic content. Moreover, in a Computer or Internet (Cyberspace) domain of Information Security, understanding and maintaining ethics is very important at this stage. A typical problem related to ethics arises mainly because of the absence of policies or rules about how computer technology should be used. It is thus, high time that there is some strict legislation regarding the same in the country.Acceptance- We should accept that the Internet is a primary component of our society only and not something apart from it.We should understand the sensitivity of Information before writing it on the Internet as there are no national or cultural barriers.As we do not provide our personal information to any stranger, any personal information related to others should not be uploaded on a public network because it might be misused.Avoid the use of rude or bad language while using e-mail, chatting, blogging, and social networking. Respect the person on the other side.No copyrighted material should be copied, downloaded or shared with others.Following are the 10 commandments as created by The Computer Ethics Institute which is a non-profit working in this area:Thou shall not use a computer to harm other people;Thou shall not interfere with other people’s computer work;Thou shall not snoop around in other people’s computer files;Thou shall not use a computer to steal;Thou shall not use a computer to bear false witness;Thou shall not copy or use proprietary software for which you have not paid;Thou shall not use other people’s computer resources without authorisation or proper compensation;Thou shall not appropriate other people’s intellectual output;Thou shall think about the social consequences of the program you are writing or the system you are designing;Thou shall always use a computer in ways that ensure consideration and respect for your fellow humans.Computers and the Internet both are time-efficient tools for everyone. It can enlarge the possibilities for your curriculum growth. There is a lot of information on the Internet that can help you in learning. Therefore, explore that Information instead of exploiting others.To read this article in Hindi, click here. | इस लेख को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। "

    "data": "You are in a mall shopping and have to login to your mobile banking portal for some reason. You go to a corner, face a wall and type your password. Wonderful! Nobody can see what you type and you are not worried at all.Think again now. No, I am not talking about shoulder surfing here, come on! Hackers can now mathematically generate your entered password by interpreting a video of you tapping on your smartphone even if the display is not visible. This has been demonstrated through an experiment at Syracuse University.\nThe mechanics behind this interpretation is to use “Spatio-temporal dynamics” to measure the distance from the fingers to the phone’s screen to guess the password typed on the phone. One of the co-authors of a paper about this technology, Vir Phoha says that it is like lip-reading. All you need to have and know is a clear video of the user typing and a known geometry and model of the phone.Insofar, there have been no incidents of hackers stealing passwords using this method. However, the risk is not very far away. With the burgeoning use of mobile banking technology due to its increased accessibility, the vulnerability increases multifold. Developers of this technology have stated that it is very simple to implement for anybody who knows computer programming. Furthermore, if used in the right direction, National Security and Law enforcement agencies could keep track of records of any criminal.The Syracuse experiments involved 50 volunteers typing PINs into HTC One smartphones, in a variety of different settings and postures. For each volunteer, researchers shot four different videos. The researchers made the recordings using two off-the-shelf devices: a Google Nexus 5 smartphone camera and a Sony camcorder. All the videos were shot from the side or back of the phone, from 12 to 15 feet away. None of the videos captured the phone screen or explicitly showed what users were typing.Software filled in the gaps, however, with a combination of image analysis and motion tracking algorithms being remarkably effective at “guessing” the PINs users typed in. On the first guess, the software determined the correct password between 40% and 62% of the time, depending on the quality of the video and the zoom ratio. The highest-quality video produced an 82% accuracy rate after 5 guesses and 94% accuracy after 10 guesses. Using more than one video for each phone raises the odds of success even further.\nOriginally hereAll this happens in the West, with new technologies and smarter internet users. However, in India, we still have the problem of people being very careless about passwords in spite of complaining that the internet world is very unsafe. Just a couple of months ago, I witnessed an IT professional openly reveal his ATM pin to a Pizza Hut attendant while swiping his card for payment. While it may be important to implement high-end technologies to stay safe, without basic internet ethics and safe-usage awareness, there is no software that can protect you."

    "headline": "BYOD: Bring Your Own Device",
    "data": "Have you been using your personal computer to send work related e-mails? Or your personal mobile for making calls to your bosses? Yes? Well, then you’ve already been practicing BYOD. For who got a “No,” this post is really for you!Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) isn’t a really new trend, but it’s becoming more and more popular nowadays. Taking your own device everywhere you go will not only make your work easier as you’re completely familiar with the device but also keep you secure. Here’s why you should carry forward this practice:Sensitive Information: Working on public devices might make your sensitive information like your passwords vulnerable, so it’s better to work on your personal devices. Your personal devices are always with you so no one can log into them and steal such information. More Efficient Output: Through a survey it has been found that people who work on their PCs tend to have more efficient and greater productivity. Adjusting to the interface of the work devices can be quite difficult for some, while working on personal devices which you’ve been using since long ago can be much easier. Mobility: This policy encourages employees to use more mobile devices like smartphones or tablets, hence promoting mobility. It is a nice step and must be encouraged as people can work from wherever they feel pleasant, and this could in turn increase productivity. Significant Cost Cutting:  Practicing BYOD may greatly cut down the expenses of the companies. This was the main reason why different companies all across the globe have started implementing this policy. Though there are some cons to it, BYOD is a more secure option. Though it’s still a debatable issue, more and more companies have started to adopt it. "

The vulnerability allows one to steal usernames and passwords of millions of Windows user.The attack can be done by fooling a user to click a particular link which authenticates with a malicious server giving away the encrypted username and password. This way several details can be collected and later implemented using a brute force attack. However, this is even possible without a link by using man-in-the-middle attack by a background Windows program.Experts around the world have claimed to not have a full-fledged solution to the problem yet.

    "data": "Facebook is the most widely used social networking platform, and hence the most vulnerable one. Most of the identity thefts around the web happens through Facebook, thus you mustn’t hold your guard down for any reason. Here are a few steps that you should follow to avoid such a risk:Security Settings: The default security settings aren’t enough for you to remain safe, so browse through all the settings and turn to “only friends” or “only me” wherever possible. Just go ahead and minimize the people who can view your personal stuff on Facebook. The power rests in your hands! Turn On Login Notifications: Go to settings -> Security -> Login Notifications and check mark the email, and/or text message radio buttons, so that whenever someone else logs into your account you’d get alerted, and you can even end such suspicious activity with a single click if you’ve enabled notifications Don’t Befriend Strangers: Do you keep on accepting all friend requests? Well, then you’re more vulnerable to identity thefts, as some of your friends might be bots that can access all your personal information. What now? If you’ve done so then go through your friends and unfriend all strangers. Do Not Geo-Tag: If you’ve enabled location services then disable it now, as it adds to your digital footprint. This is what you must avoid. If you reveal your location every time you post something, you are adding one more weapon for those looking to hunt you down. So avoid Geo-tagging. Reveal the Least You Can: Limiting your personal revelations can limit the extent of your vulnerability. Don’t reveal things like your birthday, or that you’ve married, as it can be a boon for those looking to gain access to your identity. If you’re having second thoughts about posting something, do not post it. Identity Theft Protection Tools: There are some tools that can help prevent identity theft risks to some extent. There are some truly reliable solutions on the market for you to have your pick from, such as Identity Guard and LifeLock. Use 2-factor Authentication: Two factor authentication tools like Google Authenticator generates a pin each time you log in for you to be extra secure. Even if someone, by chance gets to know your password they won’t be able to log into your account unless they have this pin which changes after a fixed interval. So now that you know how easily you can prevent an identity theft from the most vulnerable source, go ahead and implement these tips and be a step closer to becoming a fully secure netizen.To read this article in Hindi, click here. |  इस लेख को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें।"

    "data": "A question many seek answer to, those who are starting out routinely ask about how to start a career in Cyber Forensics. And as per Rob Lee, these individuals vary from completely inexperienced to those with 15 years experience in the Computer Science of Information Security vertical. Here are some questions and the more important answers:For the basic reason of dynamics, once your DNA is in you, nobody can change it. Nobody can play with molecular level of science at least changes don’t occur for a couple of decades or more. Cyber Forensics, it changes. It changes month by month to say at the least. Just a simple windows update can change your system significantly. The forensics artifacts  change like this and as a responsible and smart Cyber Forensics Expert, you must be aware and ready for any new thing that might come your way. You might become an expert today and if you don’t keep up you might not be one tomorrow.In words of Rob Lee again, “The first is a passion for computer forensics and incident response and the second one is a very large capacity to learn”. As an individual in my opinion you must never be satisfied in the real sense. You must always be open to learning new stuff and moving forward. Formal education is must and compulsory, however, in the Cyber Forensics world there is more unknown than is known.The first thing keeping the Indian scenario in mind is to become an expert at the Microsoft Windows OS family. They are the most popular, extremely complex and challenging to analyse despite the ease of use for the user. More than 90% of systems that forensics specialists investigate are Windows based and everyone in this field has to know the ABC of Windows. There is definitely going to be the software you use but just in case it doesn’t work you should know the workaround and the hard wired way to finding evidence. Once you have mastered Windows and file systems of Linux too, you should go deeper into choosing the specialty area. For example you could choose wearable technology which is going to be the new thing in the next decade.\nThe knowledge of law:\nFor digital evidence in India to be admissible in the court of law, there are a few prerequisites. Read here.This debate has been lived for many years in the west. In India, however it has not started yet. Nonetheless, we have compiled a list of few things you can try.

    "headline": "Tips To Make Your Online Transactions More Secure",
    "data": "We find threats everywhere on the internet, but the most daunting ones include insecurities to your online transactions. Many criminals in the cyber world are looking to get access to your credit card details, or your net banking passwords. There are a plenty of things about which you ought to be vigilant to avoid such a mishap. Here are some things you must open an eye for. Secure Lock in Address Bar: A padlock in your address bar shows that the site is encrypted, and hence, less vulnerable to attacks. So whenever you see such a lock, rest assured that you’re at a safe place. But this indication isn’t the only thing you should look for. There are many more. HTTPS Status: Though with the advent of HTTP2, HTTPS has become outdated, but there still are plenty of sites which rely on HTTPS status. The “s” in https stands for secure, so whenever you visit a payment portal, spend an extra second and look for https in the address bar. Never pay through an HTTP portal.   Beware of Back and Refresh Buttons: Pressing refresh, or back can cause double charging for a single purchase. Sometimes when the purchase isn’t complete and you press back to cancel one, you might get charged even if the purchase isn’t done. Though there are some sites that warn you not to press back button, there are plenty which don’t. So even if it’s taking some time, DO NOT press back or refresh buttons. Delete Cookies Later: Without cookies you can’t complete a transaction, but when you’re done especially on a public network, delete the cookies. In this way, you will get the chance to buy online without being deprived of online safety. Use Virtual Keyboard: While entering your card details or your net banking details, always use the virtual keyboard. Most of the websites provide these keyboards alongside the text box. Always enter such sensitive information using on-screen keyboard as there is always a risk of interception by some spyware. These softwares record the keys pressed on the keyboard, and hence can unveil your password or your card’s CVV.To read this article in Hindi, click here. | इस आर्टिकल को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। "

    "data": "How hackable are you? Well the question is when will you be hacked, not if. What breach awaits you at the middle of the night, you never know. From your end however it is important you use the everyday new features like two factor authentication and more. Many web based email systems provide you with lots of cloud storage sometimes even more than 20GB and for free.\nSo, you never delete messages and never bother. Many people don’t use two step verification on their email accounts and all they’ve got to loose then is a password and data worth what the hacker can make with it.So what can someone do with access to your email account?420, as they say in India because of the Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code. By reading your email only someone can learn a lot about you. Things like which bank have you recently got an account with, what networks do you predominantly use etc. The worst thing still to happen with you is identity theft and loosing personal and socially engineered data.Most recently there have been a series of events in India where exporters have been looted (The exporters scam). In these type of events the hacker only needs to use the victim’s account once in order to set up a filter and a forwarder, the rest he can manage with fake emailer services. And there have been lakhs of money laundered like this with no trace of the criminals.In another case, a lady was tricked into transferring money into an account in some other country on the context of an email conversation from a trusted close friend via their email. She opted all mechanisms of checks and validations but couldn’t prove to herself that it was not her friendSBI, ICICI, Axis or whatever bank you may be a customer of, they often send you emails about a lot of stuff. Often email ids can help gain access to your bank accounts and the rest is understood regardless of explanation.\n5. Sell your usernames and passwords:\nWell, if you have a very good username, its worth a buck on the black market of Internet (The Deep Web). Not just good, even if its just a username password it costs something and it is reasonable enough For instance Apple iTunes username passwords cost around Rs. 500 in a general situation.Use two factor authenticationUse passwords that don’t mean anythingKeep different passwords for all your accountsGive false answers to security questions so that nobody can make senseWherever you have to use your email id to log in to a website, create a separate email id for only these purposes.To read this article in Hindi, click here. | इस आर्टिकल को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। "

    "data": "Hearing and reading a lot about Section 66A of the IT Act ? If you’re from a legal background I am sure you would have understood, but if not you must be rolling your eyes at the screen. Don’t worry, I Section 66A of the IT Act, only a living memory now am here to tell a little autobiography so that all of you can understand.\nI died a sudden death on 24th March 2015. My life was a short one, but I made a difference in the little while I lived. My journey began with the 2008 amendment of the IT Act. The President approved of my arrival and i finally came into being from February 5, 2009.I gave tremors to anybody having free thoughts about writing ill, grossly offensive stuff, false information to cause hurt or injury and electronic mail just to cause annoyance, or inconvenience via means of computer device or any other communication device. I was your gateway to jail for a term of three years and an additional fine if the court deemed fit. Yes, that was my power.My parents were a bunch of lazy lads believing in the concept of copy pasting legislation from around the world. Not enough thinking was put into my making hence I was born under-developed. It was a little difficult to distinguish between my nose and lips. That fine line of clarity didn’t exist and that was the reason why my downfall began. I was too helpful so people camouflaged behind my skin and put me to bad use. A few arrests happened under my name. Finally November 2012, a PIL was filed by Shreya Singhal claiming that I was unconstitutional and impinge upon the freedom of speech and expression guaranteed under Article 19(1)(a) of the Indian Constitution. This was in regard to arrest of two girls for posting status and commenting over death of a political leader. Supreme Court then gave an order relating to the above PIL stating that I was not to be misused and no one can be arrested without approval of the Deputy Commissioner or Inspector General.Two legislative moves were suggested during 2013 to introduce my better half which was to give my life a better picture. A Private Member Bill was introduced in Lok Sabha for the same but since IPC contained my sister and brother concerns the Bill was withdrawn. Next was a proposal to introduce 4 changes of which the major was making me a part of Fundamental Right of the Constitution. Rest were all patches and fixes to give my underdeveloped body a better look and comprised of defining me better, reducing my power to punish and so on. Sadly, this too could never turn a reality. I missed on another chance. My future didn’t seem very bright. On March 20th 2015 a little chap, Vicky Khan was arrested for sharing a critical post about senior minister Azam Khan of Samajwadi Party.Well that was the last thing that could happen because 4 days later on 24th March 2015 I was sentenced to death by the Supreme Court. In its 123 page verdict Supreme Court declared me violative of Article 19(1)(a). The Supreme Court throughout thought highly about the citizen who criticized me claims that it was all important for a democratic nation. The view of general people is held above the law makers. Throughout, the Judgement is only revolving around how vague and broad I am and how I fail to impose a reasonable restriction on 19(1)(a). The court pointed out that a penal law would be void on the grounds of vagueness if it failed to define the criminal offence with sufficient definiteness. Court also said, “Ordinary people should be able to understand what conduct is prohibited and what is permitted. Also, those who administer the law must know what offence has been committed so that arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement of the law does not take place”. I believe in the fact that one comes has to leave one day. I don’t regret my short life but not bringing up any other sister concern like me is not a good idea. I was a little under developed, thanks to the principal of legislation making still being followed in India. I was put to wrong use by some but I was the one who held back millions when they seemed to gather a little courage to say or to do beyond what is right. All that was needed was a change or a rebirth. Such act of eradicating is in no case justified. You people busy celebrating the new independence just bestowed upon you, little do you realise that you’ve entered into open battle grounds. Not long before a cyberwar would be witnessed and none would be shielded by my armour, the armour of 66A."

    "data": "There might be a very few Android or iOS users who haven’t ever used Instagram. It has over half a billion active users across the globe. Unfortunately, 80% of the users take the security issues related to social networking sites very casually. So here’s why you should be concerned about such risks:Avoid Getting Personal Information Stolen: Your personal information on Instagram is very vulnerable to getting stolen if it isn’t hidden, which is why you must shield your account.Avoid Phishing Attacks: Scammers can get your unguarded Instagram account very easily, and then use this information for later targeted phishing attacks.Avoid Pictures from Getting Stolen: There are various third party apps that lets someone download the pictures from your account, and use it for various purposes. If your account isn’t set to private, your pictures are more vulnerable to get stolen.Now that you know why should you have a secure Instagram account, you must be wondering how would you do it, right? So, here are some simple tips:Ensure that your primary account is secure: The easiest way for a hacker to hack into someone’s account is through their primary email account, because almost everything is linked up with this account. So make sure you keep the password strong, and use 2-factor authenticator to be extra safe.Avoid third party apps: The third party apps that want access to your Instagram can get your personal information, thus avoid them.Keep personal information private: The personal information on your instagram is visible to everyone, by default. Keep it private so that only people following you can see them. And give the follow grant to only those who know you.Don’t reveal your location: You can smartly stay out of troubles by turning off the location feature. Also don’t upload pictures that reveal your location. You can also turn on “manually approve photo tagging” to stay out of trouble.The web is a potentially dangerous place, and hence you should walk every step very prudently. Avoid careless mistakes, and be safe!  "

    "headline": "Net neutrality in India and What is it?",
    "data": "Net neutrality has been one of the biggest questions in the recent times as far as the United States is considered. If you are updated, US got its net neutrality rules approved by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) which is something like TRAI is in India. How it was dealt with in the US was very effecient where public discussion played a vital role. More importantly the public was aware and had opinions about net neutrality and there were even protests along with silent voicing of opinion.\nNonetheless, It is now our turn, Indians. Not just to let it happen but to voice our concerns and opinions and make an active contribution.A taxi driver is a taxi driver for you, you tell him the location you want to be dropped off to. He doesn’t say no if you ask him to take you back home or leave you at a shopping mall. The cost is per kilometre and he should treat it like that.\nThe same is net neutrality. Whoever be your ISP, Airtel, Vodafone, BSNL or any of your local ISPs, they should treat all of your Internet traffic as packets of data. And that’s all, all packets, the same way.\nIn theory this is also called open internet. According to FCC,\n“An Open Internet means consumers can go where they want, when they want. This principle is often referred to as Net Neutrality. It means innovators can develop products and services without asking for permission. It means consumers will demand more and better broadband as they enjoy new lawful Internet services, applications and content, and broadband providers cannot block, throttle, or create special “fast lanes” for that content. The FCC’s Open Internet rules protect and maintain open, uninhibited access to legal online content without broadband Internet access providers being allowed to block, impair, or establish fast/slow lanes to lawful content.”India doesn’t have any legislation for the way ISPs need to be treated. We have TRAI and doing the job as yet. Earlier last year there was the whole fuss about Airtel charging extra for VoIP traffic which was quashed very bad and established a precedent, but it is not enough.\nAs far as net neutrality goes, TRAI has issued a consultation paper on regulatory framework for Over-the-top services (OTT) like Viber, WhatsApp, Snapchat, Hike etc. TRAI has done this to ask for peoples’ feedback. It is focused on OTTS and their licensing and touches net neutrality in a few other questions.\nWhy you should do something about this is fairly simpler.How would you want your ISP to charge to chat on WhatsApp more than it would on Hike?How would you like if one online store runs at an amazing speed and the other’s website doesn’t even open?It all happens at the ISP levels and stuff like this is happening. I am sure nobody wants these scary things to happen.When Section 66A could be done away with, why not net neutrality for open internet and free speech?Following is the list of the 20 questions, just in case you need a quick read.Is it too early to establish a regulatory framework for OTT services, since internet penetration is still evolving, access speeds are generally low and there is limited coverage of high-speed broadband in the country? Or, should some beginning be made now with a regulatory framework that could be adapted to changes in the future?Should the OTT players offering communication services (voice, messaging and video call services) through applications (resident either in the country or outside) be brought under the licensing regime?Is the growth of OTT impacting the traditional revenue stream of telecom service providers (TSPs)? If so, is the increase in data revenues of the TSPs sufficient to compensate for this impact?Should the OTT players pay for use of the TSPs network over and above data charges paid by consumers? If yes, what pricing options can be adopted? Could such options include prices based on bandwidth consumption? Can prices be used as a means product/service differentiation?Do you agree that imbalances exist in the regulatory environment in the operation of OTT players? If so, what should be the framework to address these issues? How can the prevailing laws and regulations be applied to OTT players (who operate in the virtual world) and compliance enforced? What could be the impact on the economy?How should the security concerns be addressed with regard to OTT players providing communication services? What security conditions such as maintaining data records, logs etc. need to be mandated for such OTT players? And, how can compliance with these conditions be ensured if the applications of such OTT players reside outside the country?How should the OTT players offering app services ensure security, safety and privacy of the consumer? How should they ensure protection of consumer interest?In what manner can the proposals for a regulatory framework for OTTs in India draw from those of European Telecommunications Network Operators (ETNO)? What practices should be proscribed by regulatory fiat?What are your views on net-neutrality in the Indian context?What forms of discrimination or traffic management practices are reasonable and consistent with a pragmatic approach? What should or can be permitted?Should the TSPs be mandated to publish various traffic management techniques used for different OTT applications? Is this a sufficient condition to ensure transparency and a fair regulatory regime?How should a conducive and balanced environment be created such that TSPs are able to invest in network infrastructure and Content and Application Providers (CAPs) are able to innovate and grow? Who should bear the network upgradation costs?Should TSPs be allowed to implement non-price based discrimination of services? If so, under what circumstances are such practices acceptable? What restrictions, if any, need to be placed so that such measures are not abused? What measures should be adopted to ensure transparency to consumers?Is there a justification for allowing differential pricing for data access and OTT communication services? If so, what changes need to be brought about in the present tariff and regulatory framework for telecommunication services in the country?Should OTT communication service players be treated as Bulk User of Telecom Services (BuTS)? How should the framework be structured to prevent any discrimination and protect stakeholder interest?What framework should be adopted to encourage India-specific OTT apps?If the OTT communication service players are to be licensed, should they be categorised as Application Service Providers (ASP) or Communications Service Providers (CSP)? If so, what should be the framework?Is there a need to regulate subscription charges for OTT communication services?What steps should be taken by the Government for regulation of non-communication OTT players?Are there any other issues that have a bearing on the subject discussed?"

It won’t have a micro or mini version – the port in your PC and that in your smartphones will be the same, so don’t worry about reversing the connector cable if you initially get it wrong.And most importantly, people have always complained that they’ve to flip over a flash drive thrice until it fits, this time it’ll work either way up. Unlike these versions:The USB Type C can deliver a whopping 100 Watts of power at 20 Volts supply voltage, thus it can not only charge your smartphones at lightning fast speed, but can also charge your laptop and wireless monitors. This will make the bulky AC adapters obsolete someday, and you don’t have to carry different cables for different purposes. The all-in-one Type C cable will do everything.This is how a Type C port looks like, against Type B 3.1 port and the power port. In the coming years, you’d have only the former one.The new USB connector is compatible with a speed of up to 10 GBps, which means you can theoretically copy a 1080p Bluray movie in less than a second. The shape of the new connector is less likely to change in near future as it has been designed in a way that it can be scaled against future researches in speed.  Go buy the new MacBook, and you can see one yourself. The Type C is already starting to appear in the new MacBook, and Google has also announced that the new Chromebook will have 2 such ports.Those worried about adapting to it shouldn’t be. There are a lot of USB adapters that have the primitive USB on one end and the Type C on the other for connecting all your old wired gadgets."

    "data": "\n We all have an account on Yahoo, no matter functional or not! While everybody seemed to be making a leap in the security sector, Yahoo was sitting with hands folded, but not anymore. Yahoo has finally taken a step to improvise security features.Gone are the days of security question. Now we are expected to remember the most complicated passwords, and not for one account but so many of them. Fed up of remembering passwords? Yes, well who isn’t? Yahoo has a solution for you. No more of thinking a shitty password and remembering it which we all know will still get hacked somehow.Yahoo is introducing on-demand passwords, which are a waste when once used for login. These passwords are specific to your Yahoo account and come on your phone. However there is one little glitch that arises.  If you lose your phone, the person in possession has your email in their hands.\nFor some sets, the SMS notification of your on demand password will show up on your locked screen, so even if they don’t have your mobile passcode and do have your email id your account gets compromised. A better alternative is two step authentication process where a main password is followed by an on-demand password. Focusing on this aspect can be taken as a positive come back from Yahoo cause this is an area even the most technically deft are vulnerable to. This is just the first step. Yahoo is also working on building an end to end email encryption plug in which encrypts the content of the mail leaving the time stamp and subject unencrypted. This is expected before the end of 2015."

    "headline": "Pornography and the Indian Law",
    "data": "In today’s IT era where every hand has the reach to Internet with just a single click, we all are very much vulnerable to Pornography. Porn today is more freely and widely available on Internet than ever before. Younger generation is therefore able to access it very easily and quickly than ever. This leads to the mentality of unemotional sex. And all this is because we have grown up in a culture where parents feel embarrassed, they are not comfortable to have a healthy conversation about sex with their children. Well then it’s time to open up and come out of our comfort zone to talk about the most hush-hush topic i.e. “Pornography”.The word pornȇ stands for prostitute, and graphein stands for documentary. Pornography literally means “Documenting a Prostitute” or “Depictions of acts of Prostitutes”. Pornography in the eyes of law is not necessarily obscene. Today, the largest industry of Internet is Adult Entertainment. There are millions of individually owned pornographic websites. Research shows that 50% of the web-sites containing potentially illegal contents relating to child abuse were ‘Pay-Per-View’. This indicates that abusive images of children over Internet have been highly commercialized.They find sexual excitement and release enjoyable and that’s what they get from porn.They try to stay unreal and find their release in reel life.It caters to the fetishes that people have and gives them an endless selection to choose from.To reduce the level of stress and uncertainty of their personal life.Conflict between the sexual moods among couples leads to watching porn.To learn about sex.Because it is easily available and others are watching.Addiction: Pornography provides a powerful sexual stimulant or aphrodisiac effect, followed by sexual release, most often through masturbation. It is addictive because it creates dependency on porn.Escalation: Over time addicts require more explicit and deviant material to meet their sexual “needs.”Paralyzing Effect: Sometimes referred as desensitization. What was first perceived as gross, shocking and disturbing, in time becomes common and acceptable.Aggression: Porn leads to acting out sexually. There is an increasing tendency to act out behaviours viewed in pornography. People turn into imitators of what they see. No emotions are involved in the act which lead to aggression.Coming to the legality of Pornography, our law doesn’t prohibit us from watching pornography privately i.e., consumption of pornography is no offence. All that the law forbids is its publication, transmission, distribution or production. Let’s have a look at the law of the country related to PornographySection 67 of Information Technology Act 2000 \n\nPunishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic form\nImprisonment for three years\nFine of five lakh rupees\nFor subsequent conviction imprisonment for five years and also with ten lakh rupees fine.\n\nPunishment for publishing or transmitting obscene material in electronic formImprisonment for three yearsFine of five lakh rupeesFor subsequent conviction imprisonment for five years and also with ten lakh rupees fine.Section 293 of Indian Penal Code 1860\n\nSale, etc., of obscene objects to young person\nImprisonment for three years\nFine of two thousand rupees\nFor subsequent conviction imprisonment for seven years and also with five thousand\n\nSale, etc., of obscene objects to young personImprisonment for three yearsFine of two thousand rupeesFor subsequent conviction imprisonment for seven years and also with five thousand1. http://www.cyberlawsindia.net/index1.htmlTo read this article in Hindi, click here. | इस लेख को हिंदी में में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें"

    "headline": "HTTP/2: How is it different from previous versions?",
    "data": "HTTP/2 is the second version of Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), which is being developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force. After HTTP1.1, released in 1999, this would be the first new version. Now you must be wondering: Why should I use it? How would it be better than the version I’ve been using? Why do I even care?Well, ignorance is a bliss but knowing things that may protect you from being vulnerable to something is even more blissful. How is it better than previous versions? Here’s the answer to it:Latency reduction  According to httpbis, the sub-organization of IETF respinsible for R&D of http/2, the introduction of header field compression and multiple concurrent messages on the same connection has greatly reduced perception of latency. In other words, the time lag between stimulation and response has greatly reduced and now your websites will load faster.Less prone to errors  This version of http is more efficient to parse as it is binary. http/1.x was completely a textual protocol so it requires four different ways to parse a message, which is more prone to errors. on the other hand, binary protocol has only one code path. Thus, it is less annoying for web-developers.Server Push This feature is also known as “cache push”. As the name suggests, it allows the server to push cache into a client’s computer. This allows the resources to load faster. The idea here is that if a client asks for a resource X, the server may know that he’ll require a resource Y, so it will “push” it without asking and will be stored in cache until the client actually asks for it.Reset In previous versions, if you had to stop a HTTP message of certain content-length, you just couldn’t unless you disconnect the TCP connection. In HTTP/2 on the other hand, you would much rather just stop the message and start a new one using reset stream frame (RST_STREAM) which will thus prevent the bandwidth from being wasted without having to tear down the connection.\n"

    "headline": "YouTube For Kids !!",
    "data": "Finally all parents can take a sigh of relief. You tube has introduced its child friendly app in last week of February 2015. The app has a simplified design with an option of kid safe content parental control and more. Unlike previously predicted that this app will only be there for android it is available for both android and ios devices.An exact number is not given but it is said that there are thousands of channels from well known entertainment brands on YouTube kids. The content available on the app goes through a two step refinement which is as follows:Step1: Algorithmically filtered for child friendliness.Step2: Manually sampled for quality control by a dedicated team.This process of checking to ensure only what is best for kids go up the app accounts for the difference in timing in when the content comes up on the web and when on the app. The apps interface is improved by making it simple and adding some colours. The buttons are designed especially for small thumbs and chubby fingers of kids. The main screen can be surfed by simple swipe so that even little kids can master the app quickly. The videos suggested below are also properly filtered so that kids are not lead to watching stuff not meant for them.Special parental controls have been included to add on to the security of kids. Parents can completely remove the search option for kids leaving them to only watch preselected videos by parents. If that wasn’t enough, there is more. YouTube has also introduced a timer option for parents to limit their kids’ session after which the app automatically closes. Another striking feature is where parents can turn off the background music so that kids can continue to watch a video without the background music which we all agree at times is a major reason for headache.There are still areas where the app suffers a setback. There is no option to optimize content according to age of children.    The app cannot be customised. Also the parent lock is not very secure. It asks parents to enter numbers spelled out as words. So an elder kid can easily open it and change parental controls. However, this is just the first step. We hope the app will improvise with time. For now kids can learn the smarter and safer way with this app. Thanks to YouTube !!!"

    "data": "Well, It is possible. Most recently through a Facebook post by  Paavo Siljamäki, director at the record label Anjunabeats, a new kind of spur was created in the Cyber Security domain and among the internet privacy supporters. Who doesn’t like privacy on these social networks? After all from relationships to life threats, it is all happening here. Anyhow what  Paavo Siljamäki had to say is here. // <![CDATA[\n(function(d, s, id) {  var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0];  if (d.getElementById(id)) return;  js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id;  js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_GB/all.js#xfbml=1\";  fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, 'script', 'facebook-jssdk'));\n// ]]&gt; In a gist, he was at the Facebook offices and an engineer asked if he could “look” at his profile, to which he assented and the engineer accessed his profile without any password. How this could have happened, seems to be like an answer at the very basic level of the Facebook framework. In a report here, a reply from Facebook was published when asked about this:We have rigorous administrative, physical, and technical controls in place to restrict employee access to user data. Our controls have been evaluated by independent third parties and confirmed multiple times by the Irish Data Protection Commissioner’s Office as part of their audit of our practices.Access is tiered and limited by job function, and designated employees may only access the amount of information that’s necessary to carry out their job responsibilities, such as responding to bug reports or account support inquiries. Two separate systems are in place to detect suspicious patterns of behavior, and these systems produce reports once per week which are reviewed by two independent security teams.We have a zero tolerance approach to abuse, and improper behavior results in termination.In a gist again, Facebook has a customer service tool that can grant access to a user’s account. According to Facebook, it is heavily controlled and monitored and without the user’s assent, an employee “will not” open their profile.If as a Facebook employee, you fall under this ambit of use, you are given access to this tool and are given a strict warning when you are hired. As per the zero tolerance policy anybody who abuses this tool will be fired by Facebook.You never know what’s breached when. There is a secure and traditional approach to everything. As a teenager or a young person, the biggest problem in India is “online relationships” having an overall social as well as psychological impact on individuals. If you are among the many who use WhatsApp to say I love you, Facebook to show off your new girlfriend, Snapchat to send the after gym pictures or a new dress selfie, we urge you to stop taking everything digital. Embrace the digital shift but act smart in the Cyber Space."

    "headline": "WiFi Security – Part II",
    "data": " After the first post, I hope you all are clear about the type of encryption you use. Here are some other very important tips to ensure your wifi security.Adopt atleast a WPA-2 encryption:When you set your wireless network chose atleast WPA-2 encryption. Reasons for the same have been explained in the previous post(Wifi Security – Part I). Don’t turn on WPS:WPS (Wifi Protected Setup) is not always consistent. It works with the help of a nine digit PIN which Is pretty vulnerable and when guessed once cannot protect you. Nothing can stop the hacker from accessing the shared data that resides on your wireless network. Never keep default passwords:Many a time’s routers come with a default password set which is generally “admin” or even a blank space. This password comes written on a document and is the simplest thing to guess. Make sure the first thing you do after setting up your router is change these passwords. Having a secure Password is an art in itself today. Still have the password your service guy set for you? Change that too immediately. Remove or replace SSID name:SSID is nothing but the name of your wireless network configured with the router. Routers come with pre created SSIDs too. Change both password and names for these SSIDs. Also never keep a general name for your SSID. It might interest a third person looking forward to a network used often for doing man in the middle attack. Man in the middle attack is an attack where a third person secretively accesses the data being transmitted between two people. Unique SSID names and password makes it difficult to hack into a network. You can even hide the name of your network. You can manually enter your network name along with the password when you wish to connect. A third person in this case will not even know your network exists while it does. This is called cloaking. However this is not a very good idea because if a hacker wants he can sniff your network and force your computer to shout out your SSID anywhere you are and then get your credentials and impersonate. Enable MAC Address filtering:MAC address is a unique code of your system. You can enable MAC Address filtering after which it will only connect to systems whose MAC is known to it. However the hacker may clone your MAC address and enter into your network. Turn off remote login:This is similar to having a default password but this time it’s a username. The username by default is set “admin”. It is like giving your credentials to the hacker decorated in a silver plate. Once the name is known, guessing a password is very simple. Thus make sure it is disabled. Say NO to wireless administrating:Always turn off wireless administration feature. You will just need a LAN to connect while the hacker would be kept at bay.                  "

    "data": "Cyber space is full of people trying to breach into some system, or to yank your personal stuff. As malware has come up a long way, so have these people who create them. So who are these bad guys? Why do they do so? Well, the answer to ‘why’ would attract a huge political and maybe, religious debate. But who are they?Here are the seven most common kinds of cyber criminals in increasing order of threats. Recognize any?1) Script kiddies: These are people who want to be hackers or think they are, but lack the technical skills required. They might hack a website that has very low security, or script a ‘virus’ that would eject your CD-drive every time you open it. They aren’t much of a threat, but still stay away from them.2) Scammers: Ever checked your spam-box? It might be full of their works. From discount on Louis Vuitton shoes to claiming you can find a girl 8 kilometers away from your house, all these are what scammers do. They too aren’t much of a threat, but stay away from their emails.3) Hackers: They usually work anonymously and create tools for hacking into computer systems. They often, but not always, hack computers without any criminal intent and are sometimes even hired by companies wanting to test their security. Hackers are a real threat, unless they work for you.4) Phishers: They want your personal information and, most likely, your identity by directing you to deceiving websites. Sometimes, they work with scammers to send emails. They pose a great threat as their target area is very wide. Since they commit identity thefts, they don’t care whether it’s of a teenager from Mexico, or a 60-year-old Russian.5) Political/religious/commercial groups: These people tend to not be interested in financial gain. They develop malwares for political ends, like Stuxnet worm reportedly created by a foreign government, which attacked Iran’s Atomic Program of its Nuclear Facilities. They are a great threat, but have limited target zone.6) Insiders: They reside within an organization, and are considered as the highest risk because they remain anonymous and they cause a lot of damage to the company’s privileged information. Though, their area of operation is limited to an organization, they are responsible for maximum damage to the organization.After they’ve done their work, we find something like this:7) Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) Agents: They are a highly organized group that conduct targeted attacks. They are generally appointed by some high state-funded authorities. They have very deep technical skills, and can access vast resources from computers. Here’s something more about them: To know how to stay away from these bad guys, stay tuned! And do check out some ways to avoid them if you’re using smartphones. You can also avoid threat to your personal stuff to some extent using 2-way authenticator. "

    "headline": "Wifi Security – Part I",
    "data": "WIFI SECURITY- Part IWifi security is one of the major concerns for one and all today. Before we proceed to learn how to secure our wifi connection it is important to understand the basics of wifi for as long as you don’t know what you’re dealing with you cannot secure it.\nThere are various types of Wifi. They basically differ in the type of data encryption protocol. The level of encryption decides the security of the network. The first data encryption protocol used for Wi-Fi was WEP(Wired Equivalent Protocol). WEP was very insecure and was replaced by WPA(Wi fi Protected Access) in 1999. However, till date we find several routers include WEP which is very risky. So if you are one of them, please change and opt for one of the protocols in WPA family.\nAlong with WPA came TKIP(Temporal Key Integrity Protocol). TKIP was similar to WEP and though once in good books of people, it is no longer considered secure. In 2004 WPA-2 was launched which made use of AES(Advanced encryption Standard). AES when compared to TKIP is far more secure. Believed to be uncrackable by even the most skilled hacker, it is even used by US government. However brute-force attacks are its major weakness.\nWPA-2 comes in two different modes: WPA2-PSK and WPA2-ENT. The term PSK stands for “pre-shared key” and is an encryption passphrase. It is authenticated by a 256bit key and is good for home and very small office networks. The encryption passphrase as set by you must be entered each time you connect. ENT stands for “Enterprise”, used for Enterprise network and is the best choice for business network. Unlike PSk where passphrase is stored locally, the passphrase is not stored locally in ENT and a new encryption key is created every time the user logs in with their unique passwords. ENT is easier to manage since it allows centralised control over users’ access to the wireless network.\nEnt requires RADIUS(Remote Authentication Dial in User Service) while PSK requires no such thing and is thus easier to setup. However there are ways to make use of the benefits of WPA2-ENT without getting into the complications of getting RADIUS. What you choose to use depends on your needs.\nIf you are still blinking your eyes at the screen, here is a simple explanation of the various options you have:On most routers we’ve seen, the options are generally WEP, WPA (TKIP), and WPA2 (AES) — with perhaps a WPA (TKIP) + WPA2 (AES) compatibility mode thrown in for good measure. If you do have an odd sort of router that offers WPA2 in either TKIP or AES flavours, choose AES. Almost all your devices will certainly work with it, and it’s faster and more secure. It’s an easy choice, as long as you can remember AES is the good one."

    "headline": "What is the cloud really?",
    "data": "India alone to create 2 Million jobs in the domain of cloud computing by this year.The ‘cloud’ is the trendy tech term many people use but not many can clearly define it. Here’s our take.\nThe Cloud as it might also seem to you is not a physical thing. It is simply a network as you may have seen at your offices or your college, the only difference being that this network is of servers and not nodes and each server has some unique function. Some are used to run applications, some store data and some deliver services. For example, over a year ago, services like Adobe moved to the cloud to introduce a new ‘Adobe Creative Cloud’. It is reducing the risk of piracy and software forgery. Now there is going to be one server that hosts the application for the users who want to use it and another server that is responsible for storing individual data.You take a picture, it stays on your memory card, We believe you. You are not using the cloud. The moment you upload it to Facebook, Instagram or any such service, you are uploading it to the cloud. You write an email and send it or you receive it, it is all happening over the cloud. So you might be using the cloud for years now.\nThe major benefit of the cloud as we have observed is primarily financial. Companies and projects don’t want to get their own equipment, set up a server room and maintain it(Plus there is a lot of overhead). They instead just get a fancy cloud service for cheap prices. The cloud is important otherwise also. People in the past used to run applications and softwares by first downloading them, then installing and running them physically on individual machines or a server in their building that they could not trust. Cloud computing allows people to access the same applications but through the internet.\nFor those who think the cloud is a new buzz, It is maybe technology-wise. But technically it somewhat used to happen earlier too, but now it happens via the internet meaning the levels of connectivity exponentially increase.\nSo why use it?\nThe cloud is easy, convenient and reliable (at least up to an extent). Saving a file to the cloud at least ensures that you will be able to access it via any computer that has an internet connection. That’s how there are now bye-bye to CD-ROMs and Flash drives.\nNow the real story. How secure is it?\nThe pinpoints of security for the cloud are limited.Passwords can be hacked. Well, that does not mean that they are not safe, they are vulnerable to a lot of dictionary attacks. Now what dictionary attacks is simple. It is cross-referencing your password hash to a set of probabilities from a password dictionary. Now hackers use dictionaries that can be 15-20 GB of plain text. So the first trick is to never use a password that is common and that is breakable. Don’t ever reuse passwords.Data going through a network is purely innocent packets. They say they encrypt it, but then there are always those backdoors. The trick here is to ensure an HTTPS channel on the webpage you are entering your passwords. Make sure your network is not being sniffed. The best, use a VPN.It is not very likely that someone will come personally for you as a machine. Humans are more likely to attack you virtually with these mechanisms. The best way to stay safe is to act smart in cyberspace with who you connect and how you behave.Government agencies with a warrant can anytime ask for data on your cloud and can get stuff from the service provider like your activity logs.Check whether the cloud server has appropriate security standards. You can find out about their technology and firewalls on their website. Keep a tab of the data you will be storing. Check if your data is encrypted while it stays on the server.\nMost importantly, understand the data sharing mechanisms and how user privileges are distributed. Check for guest accounts.

    "headline": "Adobe Flash Player: Is The New Patch Really Safe?",
    "data": "Adobe Flash player used for playing media on many websites has left open various security holes for the hackers to exploit in the span of mere 2 weeks. Though it has released three emergency fixes, there has been enough exploitation of this security bug. The version 16.0.0.305 is the newest update released this month for Windows and Mac platforms to fix the version 16.0.0.296. To check what version you’re using click here, and if that’s not the latest one, immediately update it.Well, there’s an even better way to avoid this problem until Adobe comes up with a better and more secure version of Flash Player and that is to disable it on your web browsers, but there are some website developers who still use flash to run their media. So, if you want to still use Flash, but minimize how frequently it is used, you can set your browser in such a way that Flash content will play only when you want it. And when you’ll do this, there will be a prompt every time Flash is needed: “Click to run Adobe Flash Player.” This is much safer than always allowing Flash to play.Here’s how to block Adobe Flash Player on your browser:Internet Explorer : Open “tools” menu, and click on “safety”. Then click on “ActiveX Filtering” to enable it. Since ActiveX Filtering is enabled, Flash will be blocked on sites you open as it is implemented on ActiveX Control.Google Chrome : Go to “Settings” and click on “Show Advanced Settings.” Click the button for “Content settings…” Scroll down to the “plug-ins” section, and enable “click to play” by clicking on the radio button right next to it.Mozilla Firefox : Type “about:config” in the address bar. The browser will warn you about voiding the warranty, ignore it and a window will open with a search bar at the top. Search for “plugins.click_to_play” and then double click on it, so that the “value” column changes to “true”  "

    "headline": "5 Ways to Stay Away from Malwares on Smartphones",
    "data": "A malware is some software specially designed to harm your computer or smartphone, or to get your personal information for various anti-social purposes (let’s say spying on you). It may be a virus, a spyware, worm, or a Trojan, but their sole purpose is to harm you. Nowadays, since smartphones are more in use, these malwares are aimed mostly at them. So here are some precautions that you can adopt to stay away from them: While you download stuff (songs, pictures etc.) into your mobile, be sure that you don’t download anything but what you want to download. Sometimes, rather most of the times, a file that you want to download is accompanied with a malicious software, that drains out your personal information out of your phones and can be used for anything, and the worst part is that you’d never know. One such unwanted application is Mobogenie that automatically gets downloaded onto Android phones and can cause serious troubles. Don’t believe messages on your browsers that say anything about your phone slowing down or those that offer you “hot pics”.\nWell, it must be very annoying to type your password again and again onto your device, but this is the key area where most of the spywares attack. They phish out the cache from browsers and hence, can gain access to your private accounts. So the only foolproof method to avoid this is to not save these passwords. Oh, and while you’re at it, turn on the 2-step verification to be extra safe. Click here to know more about two-step verification.You might have come across emails claiming that you’ve won a billion dollars in some lottery you never signed up for, or something like this:Never click on these links, unless you’ve subscribed or signed up for them as they may contain software that can get installed on your smartphones without your consent.This point is exclusive for Android devices.When you root your smartphone, you allow the apps to gain ‘root access,’ and once a malware gets this access, it has the rights to do almost anything on your device, without your knowledge. That doesn’t mean you shouldn’t root your phones. Just be careful while you grant Superuser privileges, and don’t grant these permissions to non-trusted software downloaded from non-trusted sources. Though we recommend not to download such softwares, but even if you do, don’t grant them Superuser permissions.Though these apps aren’t enough for keeping the malwares away, they do help to some extent. There are a plenty of such applications out there, most of them free. The best rated ones include Lookout, AVG, or Avast. Mostly, they check installed apps, and watch out for malicious codes.Ways to keep #Malwares away from your #Smartphone: https://t.co/r2Vx8NpSRg#cybersafety #virus #trojan #cyberspace #mobile #theCBI— The Cyber Blog India (@incyberblog) February 25, 2016You can read more on this from our friends at Cyber Cops here: 5 Ways to Protect your Mobile Device from Viruses and Malwares 2020"

    "headline": "VoIP in India-What’s it like?",
    "data": "VoIP in IndiaVoice over IP is not a new concept to the regular internet user. It is the routing of voice conversation over the internet rather than the PSTN (Public switched telephone network). You talk over viber, skype or facebook messenger for that fact, it is VoIP. Talking about its advantages, it includes saving a lot of money, single channel transmission of files, images, video etc. and reduction in setup and maintenance costs.\nAgain with greater ease here comes a great deal of security concerns. The main reason for security concerns apart from the users’ awareness is the protocol implementation by service providers(all of them use different protocols). Technically speaking it has two types of protocols: Signalling and Media. But they are not what we are going to cover here.\nSecurity Concerns for India are very high. The involvement of VoIP in the Mumbai Terrorist Attacks is not a news that needs to be mentioned. The terrorists used encrypted VoIP calls to communicate about the attacks. This has established the need for interception of internet telephony. It is important for the judicial bodies in India that the major companies that provide these services fall under the ambit of Indian law so that cases are easily closed. Then the most famous vishing calls, the telephone services with ‘hot babe’ messages in your inbox and fraud internet calls are the children of VoIP.\nVoIP has a very interesting timeline in the Indian Context. It saw notice way back in 1999 when this was termed as internet telephony and no need of it was sought. Hence it made no spot in the IT Act, 2000. Historically in 2008 the TRAI approved of VoIP in a report. However the government rejected the limitless access that the report advised for. In 2012 it made part of Unified License under the National Telecom Policy. Under clause 3.15 of the NTP 20123.15.To enable and enforce the VOIP facility to enhance consumer affordability.Indian companies have not yet made the big move towards VoIP services but companies like Relaince have plans it seems.\nAs of today, the legal limitations on VoIP calling are very strict. As per a story , In an RTI reply by the DoT, only certain types of internet telephony has been recognised:\na) PC to PC, within or outside India\nb) PC/a device / Adapter conforming to standard of any international agencies like-ITU or IETF etc in India to PSTN/PLMN abroad\nc) Any device/Adapter conforming to standards of International agencies like ITU, IETF etc connected to ISP node with static IP address to similar device/Adapter; within or outside India.\nAny other sort of VoIP communication is deemed to be illegal.\nIt has been established by the DoT that it would not be able to intercept VoIP communications or even block them in specific states owing to the government needed restrictions. India has a highly unregulated internet architeccture and is majorly decentralised. Security concerns are also there because now trial runs in the country have been started over skype and it a service hosted out of the country.\nIn an Economic Times report  in 2013 it was highlighted that the Home Ministry and the Intelligence Bureau of India sat in meeting and decided that VoIP Service providers would need to set up servers in India to make them subject to the Indian Laws. It also said that the ISP’s and telecommunication companies would need to segregate IP addresses on state-wide basis to allow lawful interception and blocking of certain services. The law again is not very bulletproof. There are only certain regulations about logging data. The authorities will have access to server logs for sure but will the problem be solved is a question.\nEarlier in 2014, there was a whole controversy about Vodafone’s mass tapping of phones. Tapping is still an easy activity because a hard tap will do the trick but since internet is widespread and no hard lines “technically can be identified”, tapping VoIP is difficult. We have already entered 2015 but there is no sign of an amendment to the IT Act or a policy on VoIP.\nAlso, net neutrality is a new concern that has most recently popped in India after the latest riff about Airtel charging extra for VoIP traffic. Anyhow that did not go very well and had to be scraped eventually.\n"

Use this rule to your advantage, parents. You can say no, and the website backs you up, as does COPPA, the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act, a federal law in the U.S.. (13 is the required age to have a Facebook and Twitter account, too.)No one monitors the content on Ask.fm. The website states, “The ask.fm service allows for anonymous content which ask.fm does not monitor. You agree to use the ask.fm service at your own risk and that ask.fm shall have no liability to you for content that you may find objectionable, obscene or in poor taste.”The website “is increasingly being used as a means to communicate abusive, bullying and sexualised content,” according to Webwise. It is “associated with some of the worst forms of cyberbullying” and has been linked to numerous suicides around the world, according to the Daily Mail.One user can block another user and must give a reason. Blocking someone, however, does not mean that they go away. A blocked person can still access the profile to view all other interactions. The site can be used anonymously, so users often have no way of knowing who is bullying or harassing them on the site. Users cannot increase privacy settings, as they can with the adjustable settings on Facebook and Twitter.fm is integrated with Facebook and Twitter – all these accounts can easily connect and what is posted on Ask.fm is easily shared and can appear on those other sites with next to no effort.Schools in Britain have advised students and parents to not usefm. Following the suicide of a 14 year-old girl in Britain who had been bullied on Ask.fm, British Prime Minister David Cameron said, “There’s something all of us can do as parents and as users of the internet and that is not to use some of these vile sites. Boycott them, don’t go there, don’t join them – we need to do that as well. I’m very keen we look at all the action we can take to try and stop future tragedies like this.”After Cameron called for changes at Ask.fm, the company issued a rather shocking statement. Founder Mark Terebin said, ‘We only have this situation in Ireland and the UK most of all. It seems that children are more cruel in these countries.’ One teenager over the summer received messages like “drink bleach”, “go get cancer” and “go die,” and those are quite similar to those seen in the United States.fm is based in Riga, Latvia, which is why U.S. and British authorities often have a long wait to gather data from the site. A user can disable his/her account, even if the password is forgotten. Kids have been known to tell parents that it is not possible. This is not true.  WhatsApp is developed by California-based WhatsApp Inc.WhatsApp is appearing to be contravening international privacy law by accessing the users’ whole phone book. When smartphone owners install WhatsApp in their cellphones, the app immediately scans the contact book for numbers and to match WhatsApp accounts attached to those numbers. If any matches are found then those numbers are added into the WhatsApp profile. The users have no control over this process, so WhatsApp actually records both users’ and non-users’ number, and fails to delete the numbers of the non-users of WhatsApp which harms the privacy (except iPhone 5 because iOS 6 version of WhatsApp has the option to manually add contacts from the contact list). And that was found to be the contravening issue according to the International Privacy Law.In WhatApp’s privacy policy, they mentioned that they are going to access the contact list and scan and store the numbers. Below is a short section from WhatsApp’s privacy policy: You hereby give your express consent to WhatsApp to access your contact list and/or address book for mobile phone numbers in order to provide and use the Service. We do not collect names, addresses or e-mail addresses, just mobile phone numbers. When smartphone owners install WhatsApp in their cellphones, the app immediately scans the contact book for numbers and to match WhatsApp accounts attached to those numbers. If any matches are found then those numbers are added into the WhatsApp profile.In recent times a loophole was found in whatsapp security system that hackers can obtain users’ private chats with the aid of other Android applications.Snapchat is unique in that it claims the images exist only 10 seconds or less before “disappearing.” The fact that the images supposedly don’t live forever is what has propelled Snapchat to popularity, with 30 million messages a day.On May 8, 2014, Snapchat agreed to settle charges by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) that it misled consumers, that messages do not disappear, that the company revealed users’ locations and that it collected more personal data that it indicated. The DaiLy Beast reports, “A digital forensics company discovered that the app actually saves the images to a hidden folder on the phone called RECEIVED_IMAGES_SNAPS. A file extension called ‘.NOMEDIA’ keeps the images from being viewed, but the Decipher Forensics team has found a way to take the files off the phone and change the extension, making them viewable again.”Decipher is currently charging $300 to $500 to extract the photos. The Daily Beast found that to be comforting, but I can see a collection being taken up in the junior high lunch room that reaches that figure pretty quickly if there’s something students really want to see. Your Photos May Be For Sale (Instagram, Twitpic)You May Not Be Able To Delete Your Account Ever.

    "headline": "WhatsApp Web – Really going to help?",
    "data": "\nFor all those people who have asked for so long about how to actually use WhatsApp on a laptop, here it is WhatsApp answering.Earlier there were those workarounds using android simulators to get WhatsApp on a desktop or a laptop but now we have an easy and unified way to live the experience. Talking about India alone, WhatsApp claimed in 2013 that it has the biggest market here comprising 1/10th of the total users. It has to be so ofcourse, afterall we have are 2nd on the charts of the number of internet users. What is interesting is that mobile internet is very cheap in India yet the penetration rate is not as much as it is in the United States due to a number of issues like good coverage and connectivity.You have the option to be signed out automatically and get notifications which is fancy and cool.Though with WhatsApp’s big move, the ones that have a limited mobile connectivity or a working connection on their smartphone are still going to be hooked up to the desktop or laptop. It is very much certain that those who are using WhatsApp are going to be more stuck up with it but Is it going to get more users? It might, but speaking in the Indian Context, there are areas where mobile connectivity is still poor and only leased line Internet works fine, so there is no luck there.Also, can we drive away from the privacy policy and the threat that lives everyday with this service also? First of all the issue is of age in India. WhatsApp is not really concerned legally if you are a user from outside the US. Neither does WhatsApp allow you to use its services if you are under the age of 16 nor does the Indian law (which superceeds all authority), under the age of 18.\nThe WhatsApp Site and Service are hosted in the United States and are intended for and directed to users in the United States. If you are a user accessing the WhatsApp Site and Service from the European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the WhatsApp Site and Service, which are governed by California law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you expressly consent to that transfer and consent to be governed by California law for these purposes.\nYou are throwing away your data, not to mention private messages and conversations, images, videos etc. over to the servers based out of India. Once this data is gone, no Indian Law has jurisdiction, no subpoenas, no warrants, nothing works. If by chance you fall a victim of any type of crime via whatsapp there is a very faint chance of any relief. Now there is a lot of controversy about how WhatsApp handles your data. But it’s always better to play safe. Now that Facebook has taken over WhatsApp for almost a year, this kind of a breakthrough was expected. Also, an audio calling feature is much anticipated in the coming time.\nFor your safety, it is important that you don’t share information that is private over WhatsApp or any chat client for that fact.\nWell we are going to take a bit here to explain how WhatsApp is set up on a browser. iOS users can’t really catch up yet. It is available for all other platforms thoughDo share what you feel about this interesting development."

    "headline": "Keylogger : A potential threat camouflaged behind innocence !!",
    "data": "Ever thought what it would be like if someone gets details of every tap you make on the keyboard? You will be exposed way beyond your comfort level. All your data, be it private or public, will be in the hands of someone you do not fancy. Yes, that’s the power of a keylogger and the level to which they have advanced, definitely pose a serious threat. The newer keyloggers can extract so much information that it is not even funny. Some of them can even tap your camera and microphone for “TOTAL MONITORING DOMINATION”,For those of who do not know, keylogger is software or a device that monitors and creates a log of every keystroke thus compromising with your information security. Some keyloggers even take screen shots from time to time keeping a track of your activity. These images and data are then sent to the person who is registered to get the details. Like any other software or device it’s a good tool put to bad use. Originally, key logger was designed to keep a track of employees at work, keep a track of your personal system to prevent any misuse etc. The enormous potential of the Internet has therefore led to an increase in keylogging attempts. The easy availability of key loggers in market made them a weapon of crime and the fact that even script-kiddies can make one is just an add on factor.Key loggers have root kit functionality which helps them hide in the system in the form of full-fledged Trojan programs. A fundamental concept behind keyloggers and similar malware is their pattern of attack. Most malware infections follow a fairly standard attack pattern that involves the sequential order of development, distribution and infection, and execution stages. The initial phase is vital to the process as any malware that is not yet implemented cannot be used by an attacker. What is unique about the development stage is that it places emphasis on how the latter stages will be accomplished. Distribution and execution can both be implemented as a component of the malware and therefore are a contribution factor in its design and development.Study by Provos et al.[i] shows that there are four distinct approaches to malware placement on the Internet for distribution:1) Advertisements. These provide a common hosting place for malware. As advertisements often tend to be redirections chained together, it is possible for thirdparties to inject the location of malicious content into one of the nodes in the chain.2) Third-party widgets. As with advertisements, widgets are fundamentally embedded links, often to an external Javascript function or similar entities, that can be redirected to dangerous locations.3) User contributed content. Here a typical web user physically uploads content to a public location. If the web master does an inadequate job of checking content legality and validity via appropriate sanitization techniques, malicious content placement may occur.4) Web server security mechanisms. These mechanisms also play an important role as they can impede malware placement on web sites by controlling server content such as HTML, Javascript, PHP (or other scripting languages and applications), and database contents. Therefore, an attacker who gains control of these security mechanisms has the ability to completely control the content on the web server and use it to her advantage.Studies show, that key logger has pushed back phishing to take the first spot in methods used by cyber criminals. History has witnessed a number of dangerous keylogger attacks. On January 24, 2004 the notorious Mydoom worm caused a major epidemic. MyDoom broke the record previously set by Sobig, provoking the largest epidemic in Internet history to date. The worm used social engineering methods and organized a DoS attack on www.sco.com; the site was either unreachable or unstable for several months as a consequence. The worm left a Trojan on infected computers which was subsequently used to infect the victim machines with new modifications of the worm. The fact that MyDoom had a keylogging function to harvest credit card numbers was not widely publicized in the media.One of the most publicized keylogging incidents recently was the theft of over $1million from client accounts at the major Scandinavian bank Nordea. In August 2006 Nordea clients started to receive emails, allegedly from the bank, suggesting that they install an antispam product, which was supposedly attached to the message. When a user opened the file and downloaded it to his/ her computer, the machine would be infected with a well known Trojan called Haxdoor. This would be activated when the victim registered at Nordea’s online service, and the Trojan would display an error notification with a request to re-enter the registration information. The keylogger incorporated in the Trojan would record data entered by the bank’s clients, and later send this data to the cyber criminals’ server. This was how cyber criminals were able to access client accounts, and transfer money from them. According to Haxdoor’s author, the Trojan has also been used in attacks against Australian banks and many others.[ii]News dated 13th January 2015 featuring keysweeper, a 10$ USB device with built in wireless keylogger, on zdnet.com would have definitely sent shivers through ones spine.“On the outside it looks like a regular wall wart, but on the inside is an Arduino microcontroller that allows the KeySweeper to connect to nearby wireless keyboards and passively sniff, decrypt and log all of the keystrokes. These keystrokes are then transmitted over the Internet using an optional GSM module, or stored on flash memory inside the device. Unplugging KeySweeper doesn’t make you any safer either because it also features an internal battery.This device is possible because of the painfully weak security employed by wireless keyboards. Defending against it is a challenge in itself for security researchers.”[iii]Security is a concern for everybody. The anti-virus softwares now available in the market can easily detect the presence of a key logger on your system. The static nature of keyloggers makes it easy for antimalware softwares to detect them. There are a number of simple you can observe if you have suspects that your system has a keylogger.Anti-virus:The antivirus softwares available today can easily detect a keylogger if any on your system.Task List:Check you task list (CTRL + ALT + DEL) to see what all programs are running and check for any suspicious program.Hard disk:Check your hard disk for most recent files stored. Look at contents of any files that update often as they might be logs.Msgconfig:Type “msconfig”in your run box to access the list and check what all programs are loaded at computer start-up.OTP:Make use of one time passwords as they change for online transaction wherever possible.Virtual keyboard:Virtual keyboards are beneficial and safe when the keylogger is not programed to click screen shots.Also make sure you never use a system at cyber café or someone else’s system in general for making transactions or accessing private emails etc. because the system might have a keylogger and you would be giving away your data. When keylogger detection and prevention techniques are inadequate in terms of capability or performance, user applications can simply avoid keyboard input by using alternatives for user input. A simple alternative is the use of automatic form fillers for web browsers; not needing to type in sensitive information each time a specific web page is visited reduces the leaking of private data. Another alternative is to use a different input mechanism; for example, audio input and appropriate speech recognition software could effectively foil a running keylogger.We can thus say, the power of keylogger should not be under estimated. It is working as a silent killer just camouflaged below a skin of simplicity and innocence. [i] N. Provos, D. McNamee, P. Mavrommatis, K. Wang, and N.

    "data": "Gone are the days when internet privacy was surfing the internet with your doors locked and no one watching you. The internet is becoming more open by the day. This has enabled hackers, ISP’s, services like google and Facebook to monitor all your activities from clicks to search queries. VPN is not the ultimate solution but It is no longer that VPN’s are meant for businesses and large organisations only. Anyone can use a VPN today and there are free and paid tools available.VPN stands for virtual private network and connects two computers basically over the internet through a secure channel even though connected via insecure and public networks. It works on the client server architecture, where we are the VPN clients and we connect to what is a VPN server and by encryption and secure tunneling, no one can see what information is being exchanged. The information we are talking about is your web traffic, websites you request for, passwords, people you talk to online, usernames and even the IP addresses.\nGenerally in an Internet Model, you interact with a web server directly through the ISP and the IP address on the network that your ISP has allotted to you. This IP address can be easily traced back to you. What VPN does is that it acts as a middleman between the internet and you. So all the traffic first goes to your VPN Server and the VPN server requests for the website and automatically the IP address that reaches the internet as the computer requesting is of VPN server and not yours.\nHow are you going to feel if there were guys from Facebook, Google, Twitter and all these popular services along with a bunch of guys from the websites you visit, shoulder surfing standing at your back and seeing what all are you clicking and searching for. Creepy? Welcome to reality. Yes this is the reality and you are facing it now. Some server right now is logging all you are doing, even if in the incognito or the private browsing mode.Whatever work you are doing today, you are vulnerable to being hacked . You still need to be secure and protected from the illicit activities of the hackers or simple logging by websites and web servers. There are so many basic vulnerabilities that you can protect yourself from just by using a VPN.\nHere’s a list of why you should be using a VPN:You are concerned about your online privacy, what information goes online to websites and to your ISP.You are concerned about your online security and want that your usernames don’t get stolen or preyed at.You don’t want to give away your location with your IP addresses to protect your identityYou don’t want search engines to record all your searches and your sessions.You use WiFi hotspots, public WiFi at hotels and your hostels etc.You want to access services that are only accessible in the US, UK or some other countries.(Netflix, BBC etc.)To read this article in Hindi, click here. | इस लेख को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें।Why do you need a VPN You can read more on this from our friends at Cyber Cops here: Best VPNs in India in 2020"

    "data": "As promised in a previous post, this post is all about “the right to be forgotten.” The question which first pops up our head is when and where did this first originate?We all wish to be remembered for our work and noble deeds. In our own ways we try to achieve something in our life for which we are commemorated even after our life. It is just this feeling of narcissism that brings such wild thoughts. Now suppose you do something bad and are penalised for it. After rectifying your wrong doing you have the right to be forgiven and have your mistakes forgotten. How would you like somebody to again and again bring up the same thing? How would you feel if no one gives you another opportunity just because of a single mistake? Would you like to be remembered the same way now? Definitely not!So is the case of Mario Costeja González, a Spanish man who requested the removal of a link to a digitized 1998 article in La Vanguardia newspaper about an auction for his foreclosed home, for a debt that he had subsequently paid. In 2009, i.e. eleven years later, González did not like the fact that even then when you searched for his name on Google, what you saw on the top of the result was this small financial lapse from the late 90’s. Didn’t he have the right to have this information forgotten? González thought he did and so asked La Vanguardia to take this information down. His request however was turned down. He then filed a complaint with Spanish Data Protection Agency asking both La Vangaurdia and Google to remove the story from their paper and search engines respectively. The agency director rejected the request to the newspaper but upheld the one to Google telling them to remove the links so that access to that data is not possible. After this, the Highest Court in European Union supported the Agency director’s demand saying that Google was responsible for processing of personal data and that people had a “Right to be forgotten.”Here is a brighter picture and the story of how it was welcomed in Europe giving individuals space to maintain privacy and have search engines forget them when they feel it violates it. The situation isn’t always so easy to interpret. Often this is used to remove the stories that might affect other people while it violates one’s privacy. Does this mean one’s privacy can be given an upper hand over public’s right to know the information? How do we judge what is necessary or not. Such questions still surround Google as the judgement or the law say nothing about it and it is open to interpretation till date.The Right to be forgotten is still a legal predicament in India. The ruling is not binding on India and applies only to European countries. None of the Indian Legislation such as IT Act 2000(amended in 2008) or the IT Rules 2011 has provisions for right to be forgotten or the right to privacy.“In India we do not have a concept of the Right to be Forgotten. It’s a very Western concept,” said Pavan Duggal, a.  Still, intermediaries like search engines and Internet services providers, under the country’s IT Act and IT Rules,  have the obligation to exercise due diligence if an aggrieved party sends them a written notice, he said. According to Sunil Abraham, executive director of the Centre for Internet and Society, an Internet rights lobby group, “right to be forgotten” cases should pass the “public interest” test. “Privacy protection should not have a chilling effect on transparency. The question is: Does the content (which a user wants to be removed) serve a public interest that outweighs the harm that it is doing to the individual concerned? If no public interest is being served, there is no point in knowing what the content is all about. The complication with the EU ruling is that it wants intermediaries and over-the-top providers to play the role of judges,” said Abraham.[i]All we can say for now is Right to be Forgotten is still a distant dream for India. Before that happens we have various other milestones to cover. Amendments in the IT Act and introduction of new legislation related to issues like privacy, netiquettes etc. are the need of the hour. The Indian cyber picture needs a serious look into because it is not stepping but practically galloping into it. [i] : http://www.livemint.com/Industry/5jmbcpuHqO7UwX3IBsiGCM/Right-to-be-forgotten-poses-a-legal-dilemma-in-India.html?utm_source=copy"

    "headline": "Six Tips for Windows Security",
    "data": "Turn on family safety, turn on the firewall, turn on automatic updates, use a genuine copy of windows and software and use strong passwords (Oh my! like they are so safe).\nYou might just look around on the web for some windows security tips and measures and find all these things written. It is important to have good firewalls and antiviruses on your system. Not that we defy any of the suggestions but they are pretty much understood. And a lot of people following these even get hacked or are vulnerable. So what is the real deal?\nFirst of all it is important to save yourself some offline attacks. The very basic level of hacks that can compromise your systems are the ones that be locally done. When we talk about more common, elite and disturbing attacks, they happen online.\nLet’s pick this up from the scratch. Your friend gets access to your laptop, you have your passwords stored on there and he gets an easy log in. He might just play a prank on you. Now, replace this friend with someone looking to do some mischief, a criminal maybe. It is scary, believe us.To aware those who don’t know, breaking through a normal windows password however complex takes under 8 minutes.(And we are not discussing the how to here). But it is dangerous. Your system is practically zero percent secure if you just have that one password on your laptop and you have some data to protect.Hold and press the Windows Button and R to go the run dialog box. Type in ‘syskey’. Go through the simple procedure and set up the syskey password. This is the password that is asked for, before the welcome screen of the windows. So, here it is. We have a new sweet layer. Safe enough? No.\nBreaking through the syskey for someone who is just a script kiddy is maybe little bit of a task but for someone who knows the job and We are not talking one in a million here, an odd one in a hundred let’s say, its a piece of cake. The SAM file in your System32 directory holds the syskey password that can be broken with just a little more effort and some good tools. So what now? Don’t worry. We have the solution.Depending on the make of your laptop, go to your boot menu and look for the security tab to add a bios password. This is the last layer of security that you can add. And we suggest you do it. Because without this master password, your bootloader won’t open and if the bootloader won’t open means your Windows won’t open. The only way to crack a BIOS password is to reset the jumper on the CMOS battery. Well, if somebody gets to that then what can we say.Someone gets access to one of your accounts on the system and just quietly sits there. You operate as usual and don’t even know that you have been compromised. He can actually set up a remote connection to your machine while sitting anywhere actually.\nTo do this go to Computer>Right Click to Properties. Locate Remote Settings on the left pane and untick the allow remote connections tab.The basic applications like Microsoft Office enable you to add a password to your documents. You must follow this technique in order to protect sensitive information and data. There are some high end folder lockers as well you can try to stack in more data than just documents for security.For those who haven’t heard BitLocker is an integrated tools with the Windows Suite which encrypts your hard drive partition with a password and you can select your custom settings with operating it. This helps store your sensitive information in the encrypted format. Speaking of personal experience here, I was saved from a serious Extortion with the help of this tool once. The intruder just got to my un-encrypted drive which only had the useless stuff. You must get into this healthy habit.Don’t store password, log in credentials, bank account details etc. on a sticky note near your desk or on a text file on your desktop or drive. That is a very stupid thing to do given the situation of cyber crime these days.Apart from all these, escalate the UAC slider. Just go to start and search for UAC and on the settings pane it should show up. This is important to better authenticate applications and services demanding access. Pay heed to this setting."

    "headline": "Google Privacy Policy – Nuance between Good and Bad",
    "data": "In our everyday life it bemuses us if someone knows our name while we don’t know a thing about them.  Ever wondered how it would be like if someone just knocked up at your door one day and goes on telling your name, address (obviously that’s where he is standing), work place, birthdate, your interests, music you listen too, videos you watched, sites you surfed, total number of your emails, last when you logged in, the no. of tabs open that time, your hobbies, your relatives and similar actions of their. No less than your bio data indeed. Strange, isn’t it? Well Google does all that to you. While you search on Google, it searches and maintains data about you, provided you are logged in. It claims to do so in order to be able to serve you better. Google put forward a transparency tool called “Dashboard” in 2009. This gives you the entire data google has about you in a single window. In January 2012, google condensed down the various privacy policies it had for its various products (about 60) into a single privacy policy pretty much covering it all. This indirectly helped google get more access to your data. This was done for googles commercial benefit.Sachin Pilot, Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology issued a statement explaining India’s current laws on privacy and the government’s stand on the issue. The important part:Rectification of conflict between Google, an US Company and European Directive on Data Protection is not within the purview of Government of India.The new Google Privacy Policy provides information to the end users as to how their personal information is collected, for which it is collected, processed and secure. The end users, however, need to fully understand the privacy policy of Google, the consequences of sharing their personal information and their privacy rights before they start using online services. As explained in the statement, the 2011 amendment of the IT Act of 2000 directs companies to protect private information and clearly disclose their policies on how the information will be used. Google has done this and as such the government does not need to intervene. Google’s use and/or abuse of user information for targeting ads and knowing their users’ behaviour is not new, the government has better things to do than go after Google when nothing can be done. [i]Google used this data to manage its Ad Sense better for which companies would willingly pay a huge amount of money. One can easily check the ad settings of their profile by logging in. Ad Settings shows your gender, age, interests which are used by companies for their profit.In 2014, Verge studied the accuracy of Google profile and the results were way more than expected. Google could predict accurately to an extent of 50%. The “Ok Google” feature helps Google to maintain your voice patterns. Google uses gps activators to study your daily activities and keeps a track of your home, work place, kilometres you travelled in a day, your fitness level, your gym place based on the time you spend at these places. The Google Chrome helps it maintain the entire web browser history which gives it a better insight about who you are. Integration of Google in smart phones makes it all the more easier and accurate.It is rightly said, what goes in the virtual world stays there. There is no way you can stop Google from tracking you around. While all this data is used by Google to serve people better and to improve their experience, this can often be creating problems for them. This led to Europe compelling Google to introduce the “Right to be forgotten,” about which we will discuss in detail in a blog soon coming up. It was noticed that people had more problem with Google keeping their data than any other person in real world.There are definitely those ways of barring the use of google and its applications but then the question arises, at this height of an IT renaissance is it possible?original here: [i]"

    "headline": "Cyber Security Threats in 2015 – The Indian Story",
    "data": "There is a lot of buzz about what is going to happen in the year 2015 in the cyberspace. As far as technology goes, we are definitely hitting the cloud big time, newer credit card technologies, better encryption, new backends and more secure systems. And when we talk about crime there’s a lot more in numbers for India, The Indian picture of cyber crime has seen only ups in the past decade and extreme rises in the past couple of years. An Assocham-Mahindra SSG study has predicated recently that cyber crime in India will hit the 3 lakh figure with more than a 107% increase rate as of now.\nThe E-Governance system in India is growing, more online shopping portals for anything to anything are opening. We are digitizing ourselves very fast but are we ready for what is to come. Not just for 2015 but for years down the line too. A major report marking the new year gave a few head notes about what is expected in the cyber security domain in 2015. Here is our version of it.As a nation we have started the make in India campaign. It is time we start a set up(Servers) in India campaign too. Any leading servers that Indians access are based out of Europe or USA and NSA has its strict monitoring policies and India has no privacy law. The real fight about this is actually going on far west, in India what we expect is an ever higher crime rate with the non sophisticated crimes also.Extortion scams are expected to be on the rise. Who hasn’t heard yet must check out the Sony extortion case. This extortion was about a promise to shelve The Interview( a movie released online). At rather smaller scales and what requires minimum skills it is based on ransom-wares. Now ransom-wares haven’t reached India yet and if there is some time, it is now that ransom-wares hit India with spam SMS’s easier and services like mobile money coming into the scene.Data theft and the corporate issues have been around for quite a while in India. Data is the most priced possession of any company or government. And this loss is expected at bigger stakes. The Sony hack also posed this scenario as a matter that companies and organisations in India also need to look into. Then there are those malware that are capable to wipe off hard disks at once, a good backup scheme is a must for organisations right now.They contribute greatly to the overall cost of the cyber crime that the nation has to pay. And the situation is not going to improve. Off the line a little bit, but I have still seen people use Maestro cards that need only card number and one password to make huge transactions. The world has reached quantum encryption and RSA enabled devices. We still face phishing crimes, vishing is the new in. Frauds are on the rise every day.\nIndia has also reached RSA enabled devices but the technology reach to the grassroots is the grey area. If only the population of  India that preaches cyber security uses the safe technologies, its a loss that we are all facing each year. The hard reality is that the villages and small towns are still in the backlog. It is important to move the whole nation together in this technological shift.Human trafficking via the web has picked up pace lately, bullying and defamation is still happening and are expected to keep happening. The spam check on these networks is minimal and so, spamming is also going to be on the rise.Its the year of the world cup of Cricket! There is definitely going to be the gambling online and the saddening part is that so much of it goes undetected. To add to the situation, there is no law about it.The stuxnet attack is one of the most famous attacks under this head note. Stuxnet was used to sabotage Iran’s Uranium enrichment program. Similar attacks can be expected but as far as we perceive it is going to be mostly aimed at government and the corporate world. Security of the nation is much more at risk the physical way.Though the potential is massive yet the security threats are also prominent. There will be more educated burglaries, privacy violations and medical issues. Wearable tech gives out a lot of information about someone’s location , their activities and lifestyles. The data loss of these technologies will be very costly to the individuals. Such a good feeling at the end of it. It is expected that this year will mark the introduction of a new or an amended IT Law in India that encapsulates things like online gambling, extortion, spamming and cyber bullying etc. All these types of crime need recognition so that they can be dealt with in a better wayCyber Security Threats 2015 India"

    "headline": "Minimum Age to Use Social Networks in India",
    "data": "Minimum Age to Use Social Networks in IndiaIntroductionWe strive to be more united and connected virtually to the people in our lives. Social media websites are one of the ‘coolest’ places for kids and means of socializing for their busy parents. But where are we actually taking this virtual life of ours? Are Indian children headed in the right direction? What about their safety? Are they surfing the way they should? Primitive social networking would be Orkut and Facebook and those browsers based scenarios. Now, the world prefers Whatsapp, Instagram, Tiktok, and Snapchat and what not and so is the new India. Social networking has encouraged new ways to communicate and share information.Relationships going online reduce the capacity of the children to understand the pros and cons of the real world. Individualism by the social networking is creating a new style of life, a style where individuals come first. Individualism restrains the habit of understanding and accepting the relationship. With the increase in the uncensored use of social networking, kids are vulnerable to online fraud and aggressive marketing techniques. So there must be an age, like for marrying is, like for being a laborer, the age that is right?Minimun Age to use #SocialMedia networks in #India: https://t.co/gqmbwLZ8bE#DigitalIndia #cyberspace #theCBI— The Cyber Blog India (@incyberblog) February 11, 2016What age is right for a child to expose himself to so much of the web? For other nations, it is an easy policy of 13 years or so. In India, we have different situations.The legal framework of India does not allow anyone under the age of 18 years to join any social network, and for some reasons, it is a matter of great pride for kids to join these networks creating profiles with fake ages. You can look around and find many such examples where a 14-year old kid is already 25-year old on Facebook.In India however, why the age as suggested by Facebook is also not applicable is a rather strange issue. The number of definitions to who a child is are varied, IPC says something, Child Marriage and Restraint Act says something and so on. But going by the pure nature of this existence as legal, we have to look into the Indian Contract Act, 1872 and the Indian Majority Act,1875 which clearly specify the age bar of 18 years. So does that mean, all the I agree and Yes please buttons that we have clicked our childhood mean nothing?From the legal front here, this is a very clumsy issue. No cases have surfaced that talk about this issue so the stand of Indian Legal System is a little shaky on this one. This is a question out in the open and a matter of concern which many people in India, many visionaries have taken up for discussion.Case in pointThe Delhi High Court in 2013 asked the Union government to explain how it was allowing children below 18 years to open accounts in social networking sites such as Facebook and Google.A Division Bench of Justices B.D. Ahmed and Vibhu Bakhru asked the Centre to respond within 10 days when counsel for the former BJP leader, K.N. Govindacharya, the petitioner in the matter, accused the two sites of not verifying the details of its subscribers. It posted the matter for further hearing.The Bench also impleaded Facebook Inc. and Google Inc. as parties to the petition and issued notices to them. Their Indian subsidiaries had responded to the petition.Earlier, lawyer Virag Gupta, arguing for the petitioner, said the agreements entered into by minors here with the sites were against the Indian Majority Act, the Indian Contract Act and the Information Technology Act. In June 2012, Facebook, in a statement filed before the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said that more than eight crores of its registered users had given false identities. Cyber law experts say that there may be merit in the petition, as misrepresentation can invite penal action. “Creating a false electronic record is an offence under the Information Technology Act and the Indian Penal Code. Under Section 465, the offence would attract punishment up to two years’ imprisonment and if the account so opened is used for the purpose of cheating, it would be punishable with a maximum of seven years’ imprisonment”.Children “openly lying about their age to create accounts on these websites” were likely to face potential legal exposure” and even parents “who knowingly misrepresent information about their children while opening accounts in their names,” could be prosecuted under the IPC and the IT Act. “Ignorance of law is no excuse”.(The case update is given below.)It is inevitable to not make note of the infamous European Council agreement that happened a couple of years ago. At London, including Facebook, Google, Yahoo and Microsoft, a total of 17 web firms signed up for the first European agreement to help protect children from harm when using social networking sites. The first Social Networking task force was set up to fight the significant threats they observed in Europe and came out with this agreement. The social networks agreed they would provide an easy-to-use and accessible ‘report abuse’ button. They would ensure that the entire online profiles and contact lists of website users registered as under 18’s are set to ‘private’ by default and prevent underage users from using their services and many other such clauses.Suggestive ConsiderationsIf Europe can take such innovative measures in their system, when they do not even have as many users as India does, can’t the Indian legislation begin with strengthening itself to support kids in a legal framework on these social platforms? Here are a few considerations while dealing with this issue:Lay down a provision for the usage of social media by kids above 13 years of age.Problem is, kids lie to their parents or hide about stuff because they feel their parents will bar them from using social networks or shut off their internet.Explore possible ways to build a bridge between parents and children.Indian Government should get into agreements with social networks for reformsA panic button, under 18 users be non-searchable and content limitation should be put in place.Show applicability of the law to children also so that they can fear an action they do.Update on April 30, 2020 (Raj Pagariya):All the hearings of W.P.(C) 3672/2012 from June 2012 to April 2016 have been checked. The hon’ble court has only discussed permitting children with 13 years of age in its order dated 23.08.2013.And insofar as this order is concerned, the court only recognised that there is no dispute as to children less than 13 years of age are not permitted to create accounts on social media platforms. It seems that the court did not entertain the petitioner’s contention that minors signing up for social media platforms is a violation of the Indian Contract Act, 1872, and other such laws.Moreover, it appears that the issue was whether the intermediaries are compliant with the 2011 guidelines or not. Also, this discussion will be considered as obiter dicta, i.e., it does not carry any weight for enforcement. To read this article in Hindi, click here. | इस लेख को हिंदी में पढ़ने के लिए यहाँ क्लिक करें। Minimum age to use Social networks\n"

    "headline": "Network Sniffing and Security Measures",
    "data": "Sniffing is a common word in everyday parlance. However, does it have any alternative usage in the realm of Cybersecurity? How about using Network Sniffing as a cybersecurity jargon? Currently, most of the people that are already a part of the field are aware about the concept of Sniffing. However, for an average Internet user, it may be a foreign term. However, let us attempt to understand what it really is, right from scratch.It is the most commonly used trick, you can say or science or a mechanism(whatever suits you) used by prying hackers. It involves the following: Capturing Identifying Decoding Inspecting InterpretingNow, for those who don’t know, packets are the lifeline of internet communication. They are the messengers that carry information. Like in old days if somebody could catch a pigeon that carried a note, they would get to read it. It is like that pigeon. But network sniffing is not catching the pigeon, it is just being able to read what it is carrying.Anyway coming back, the purpose of this network sniffing can be anything from spying to serious attack planning, hacking credit card details or trying to understand the behavior of the target. Most widely it is used to acquire authentication credentials. To understand what the packet contains in depth, we should know what is the OSI Model. It is a standard followed by the TCP/IP protocol abiding by which packets are generated at one end and received and decoded at the other. They are the rules of communication and essentially are divided into layers.#Network #Sniffing and #Security Measures: https://t.co/ThRXBnGNhf#infosec #cyberspace #wifi #theCBI— The Cyber Blog India (@incyberblog) February 16, 2016OSI Model Network Sniffing VulnerabilityThat is why they say, if you are connected, You are vulnerable.Even if your packets are well encrypted, anyone on the network sitting silently can map out your entire topography and carry out another attack like the more sophisticated Man in the middle.\nNetwork Sniffing can either be done internally when someone is sitting on your network or on your firewall that sends packets outside or even wireless by catching packets that your transmitters send in the air. Network sniffing is a constructive activity at times also, when it is used to analyse and troubleshoot networks but most significantly it is used by hackers.\nA packet is like a free bird meant to reach somewhere but it does not mean that it cannot be stored or made a copy of. A sniffer software contains its own network driver and buffer memory in order to capture a large chunk of packets. More elite sniffers are capable of analyzing the packets and converting them into more statistical data.So how to protect yourself Talking about protection,First thing is to possibly turn your adapter to disable the promiscuous mode(if your adapter allows, else change it) But there is no certainty of this application.Use SSH instead of telnet to remote log in.Always have more complex and long passwords to your routers.Make sure that your router is not set to broadcast your SSID. This will stop sniffers like Net Stumbler.Use Mac filtering. Most of the latest routers support this.Always try to login to https connections only.Try to use VPN services when using free public WiFi.The safer but not so convenient way is to use switched networks. Switched networks are designed to deliver packets directly to the node and are not visible to other nodes decreasing the chances of sniffing it on the way. Also it is easy for administrators to detect sniffers on switched networks. There are some anti sniffing tools available on the internet like XArp, Arpwatch, Wireshark etc. but then they are all limited to a level.\nNetwork Sniffing Protection GuideNetwork Sniffing Protection Guide"

    "headline": "Digital Evidence Law India and all about Anvar v Basheer case",
    "data": " The law dealing with digital evidence varies from country to country. In India, the legislation that merged cyberspace technology and the law was the IT Act, of 2000 (amend. 2008). Yet the legislation holds a very minimal mention of digital evidence or even the type of cyber crimes that we see today. Indian law incorporated digital evidence into the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.Section 3 defines ‘all documents including electronic records produced for the inspection of the court’, as ‘documentary evidence’. Further, any other statement-related evidence is ‘oral evidence’. This section is relevant for digital evidence.So what exactly is an ‘electronic record’?For this, let us look at Section 2(t) of the IT Act, 2000. It means ‘data, record or data generated, image or sound stored, received or sent in an electronic film or computer generated micro fiche.’It is very easy to understand the meaning of data, record, image, sound and so on within the definition. A microfiche is a photographic film containing microimages.Therefore, digital evidence can include anything from word documents to transaction logs, FTP logs of a server, GPS System tracks, computer memory, browser history and sorts of windows artefacts. (See here)But, to recognize these records, we need to take a peek at Section 4 of the Act.  It states that:If any law requires information to be in written, typewritten or printed form, it can be :rendered and made available in an electric form, or;is accessible for subsequent reference. Now, to further look into whether such evidence is admissible in Court, we must get back to the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.Section 17 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 defines admission of evidence. In addition, Section 22-A provides for when any oral admission as to the content of the electronic record is relevant to the Court. Remember that until your evidence is admissible, none of the corroborations that you provide about its genuineness will be valid. After the test of admissibility, the biggest players in this scene are Sections 65-A and 65-B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While Section 65-A talks about how electronic records may be proved, It is to be read in accordance with the conditions under Section 65-B. Section 65-B (1) states that any information—from the computer or device in question— whether printed on paper or stored, recorded or copied in optical or magnetic media shall be called a ‘document’. This is admissible in any proceeding when it serves as proof of the original information or even if it is direct evidence. But, such a document can act as a piece of admissible evidence only when it satisfies all the requisites under Section 65-B. That is why for investigators, evidence retention and preservation are important.Section 65-B (2) lays down four prerequisites for the admissibility of a piece of digital evidence:Firstly, the computer output containing the information should have been produced by the computer. This act must have been done only during the period of using the computer to store or process information. Such regular use was only to any activities routinely carried out during the period. In addition, the person using the computer must have lawful control over the use of the computer.Secondly, it must be shown that during the said period, the information contained derived was ‘regularly fed into the computer in the ordinary course of the said activity’. Such information must be of the kind contained in the electronic record or the electronic record must be of the kind from which the information contained is derived.Thirdly, during the material part of the said period, the computer should have been operating properly. If it was not operating properly for some time, that break in time should not affect either the record or the accuracy of its contents.Lastly, the information contained in the record should be a reproduction of or derived from the information fed into the computer. And this must be in the ordinary course of the said activity. (Originally here)Section 65-B (4) issues a certificate to identify the electronic record. This certificate describes the manner of producing the information contained. It gives the particulars of the device involved in the production of that record and deals with the conditions mentioned in Section 65-B (2). Finally, a person occupying a responsible official position (in relation to the operation of the relevant device) signs the certificate. This deems the electronic record to be evidence of the matter.#DigitalEvidence Law in #India: https://t.co/UiSrF3RsKM#cyberlaw #cyberspace #evidence #hashing #theCBI #LEAs— The Cyber Blog India (@incyberblog) February 20, 2016Before 2000, Electronically stored information was considered documentary evidence. This evidence was secondary in nature. These electronic ‘documents’ were cited as ‘printed reproductions’ or ‘transcripts’. Consequently, a competent signatory certified the authenticity of the documents. The signatory would then, identify her signature in court and be open to cross-examination. This simple procedure met the conditions of both Sections 63 and 65 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.The introduction of the Information Technology Act, 2000, amended section 59 of the Evidence Act. It excluded electronic records from the probative force of oral evidence, in the same manner as it excluded documents. Making an electronic record of oral evidence would amount to documentary hearsay evidence. Hence, this simply reapplied the documentary hearsay rule to electronic records.In addition, the IT Act inserted two new evidentiary rules for electronic records in the Evidence Act: section 65-A and section 65-B. Therefore, electronic records were no longer secondary evidence under sections 63 and 65 of the act.However, for a long time, the special law and procedure created by sections 65-A and 65-B of the Evidence Act did not apply to electronic evidence. This was disappointing since the cause of this non-use did not involve the law at all. India’s lower judiciary (trial courts) is vastly inept and technologically unsound. With exceptions for a few, trial judges simply do not know the technology the IT Act comprehends. It was, therefore, easier to carry on treating electronically stored information as documentary evidence.This was the status quo that even the Supreme Court had upheld in the Parliament attacks case (State v Navjot Sandhu). It admitted the copies of call detail records without following procedures under Sections 65-A and 65-B.In the Anvar case, the Supreme Court relied on two maxims —generalia specialibus non derogant (“the general does not detract from the specific”) and lex specialis derogat legi generali (“special law repeals general law”).This meant that Sections 65-A and 65-B of the Evidence Act override the general law of documentary evidence. Therefore, for the Court to admit electronic evidence, the evidence had to satisfy all the requisites of section 65-B.The view of the apex court thus disqualified oral evidence to attest to secondary documentary evidence. Nonetheless, only later, did there exist one belief that supported the disqualification. It was the fact that oral evidence under Section 22-A spoke about the genuineness of the evidence, not of the content given by an expert witness (under Section 45-A of the Act).Now, the thumb rule to verifying evidence is by means of the specific laws of the Evidence Act.Digital Evidence Flowchart"

    "data": "Windows artifacts and forensicsArtifacts… what are they? Why are artifacts so important?* 91.8% of traffic comes from computers using Windows as their Operating System.\n* As an examiner or a practitioner,  you will most likely encounter a system that runs Windows.Artifacts, for an examiner, are the mines that can be minted for data. If you are familiar with something called the ‘windows registry’, you will know that this is the most invaluable source of forensic artifacts for all analysts. It keeps a track of all user activities and applications, which is all the information that an examiner needs to begin with. However, knowing binary logic is important because all windows registries are based on these binary values and their interpretation.Press the Windows button + R to go to the run dialogue box,Type regeditYou are now in the windows registry.While you could use the open-source tools that are in flying numbers, will they ever make you a real Forensics Examiner? Nonetheless, to get to the real way of doing things, it is important to learn the basics.First, we will go through one type of registry to understand the process. (OpenSavePidlMRU)Go to the Windows Registry.Navigate to HKEY_CURRENT_USER>Software>Microsoft>Windows>Explorer>ComDlg32>OpenSavePidlMRUClick on the type of file you want to check and here on the left you have the files you can open to check the open/save history.Therefore, using the same method, you can check other artifacts depending on your analytic skills. Windows Registry for OpenSaveNow that you know how to go through applications, you can also go through USB devices.Go to the Windows Registry.Navigate HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE>SYSTEM>ControlSet001>Enum>USBSTORHere, you can find a list of the devices ever connected.If you need you can use the popular USBDeview, which can give you a more arranged form of data.Further, once you learn about all the artifacts, you should then learn how to read these artifacts. The device IDs for USB mass storage devices in Usbstor.inf take the usual form for USB device IDs. This is composed by using the information in the USB device’s device descriptor:USB\\VID_v(4)&PID_d(4)&REV_r(4), where:v(4) is the 4-digit vendor code that the USB committee assigns to the vendor.d(4) is the 4-digit product code that the vendor assigns to the device.r(4) is the revision code.Furthermore, you can also go over to the SQLite files in the User>AppData Folders and browse those databases for more information.Hence, these are all the artifacts that you need to know to get ahead. "

    "headline": "The Cyber Forensics Guide",
    "data": " The Cyber Forensics GuideCyber Forensics, also known as Computer Forensics, is a subject which requires some explanation and introspection.  To explain, it involves bringing out data as proof for a crime (involving electronic devices) with set investigation procedure and presenting technical evidence in a court of law. It involves multiple techniques, including analysis and data recovery, to uncover material facts for evidence.However, understanding its technical and legal spectrum is tough to master.  To begin with, an interested reader must be ready to test their analytic bandwidth. In order to do so, one must master reading and understanding binary digits i.e. the bits, 0’s and 1’s  and Boolean Operators, Logic. Having discussed that, it is not a child’s play to carry on the process of forensics. To understand, one may correlate it with programming- there is a way to do something, without disclosing your code or using the standard formats. You will achieve the goal, but will your goal be acceptable? It is therefore safe to say that half knowledge or misinformation can damage the process of understanding and carrying out computer forensics.For aspiring professionals, the most important thing to enter the field of cyber forensics is comprehending the sciences of evidence retention and acquisition. In order to simplify, the timeline below gives a brief idea about how one should proceed. For understanding the legal perspective and law on digital evidence in India, see here. To learn about artifacts and how to extract data and analyse it, see here. This brief guide has been compiled in order to provide clarity regarding the intricacies, legal and technical positions regarding cyber forensics and digital evidence.The Cyber Forensics Process  "

    "headline": "Seven Must Have Internet Privacy and Online Security Tools- India",
    "data": "Seven Must-Have Internet Privacy and Online Security ToolsInformation Security and Internet Privacy have become two of the greatest concerns today in the digital era. Why? Mostly because (as far as India is concerned), the Information Technology Act, 2000 and Rules do not adequately govern Internet privacy. The GDPR’s ‘Right To Be Forgotten’ initiative is lauded globally, and even got recognition in India with the landmark judgement Justice K.S. Puttaswamy v. Union of India in 2017. However, apart from its implicit recognition in the ambit of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, the right is yet to be understood and exercised.Given the known facts that India is such a huge internet market, it is disappointing that the levels of information security awareness and Internet privacy among people is abysmal. The pending status of the Digital Personal Data Protection Bill, 2022, does not provide hope for the long discussions around data protection regulations.For these reasons, we have compiled a list of seven must-have internet privacy and online security tools that internet users may use for safety, data protection and personal safety.1. Tor Browser: (Download)Known as the onion router, it is one of the best undefeated internet browsers (Well, nothing is bulletproof really). What happens when you communicate over a network is that packets bearing anything you send are transmitted. This browser uses relays to hide your identity from packets as much as possible. This does not mean you can use this for committing a crime because the reach of law enforcement is beyond those preying on you and this bit of edge is always a necessity.Tor Browser            2. For Emails: (Download)Either you could use PGP/GPG Encrypted email service or you could just take care that your passwords are strong and you have all security settings for your email done proper.Encrypted Email Service             3. Last Pass:(Download)This little tool here can do a lot of help to all those who are concerned about security but cannot remember too many passwords. Anyway, passwords is a key area of both Internet privacy and your online security and one which everyone talks about but still people don’t do much about it. The application creates a vault for you(which is encrypted) and once you login to your vault, all the passwords become visible as plain text. As soon as you logout, everything self encrypts again.Last Pass                  4. Ad Block: (Download for chrome)While we guess most of you have it by now, you would have done it to avoid annoying ads and to bypass ones on YouTube. But more importantly this tool is important for you because you need to avoid the adware as well that are floating on the internet just as much and you can fall victim to them easily.Ad block for chrome            5. HTTPS Everywhere: (Download)This tool is important given the current scenario in India, phishing crimes are on the rise even today. This plugin is available for most of the browsers and what it does is fairly simple. It forces the browser to load the secure version of any webpage over the normal version. This helps ensure that passwords are sent over an encrypted medium.https:// everywhere              6. KeyScrambler: (Download)This is one of those tools that secures each keystroke that you make i.e. encrypts it. In the free version it is only available for web browsers but guess that is enough to begin with. Keyloggers today are becoming obsolete unless an elite hacker is targeting you, so protecting keystrokes on the system is not as important as it is to protect keystrokes online.KeyScrambler.    7. Eraser: (Download)Download this simple and straight utility to erase any file completely from your computer. It wdeletes a file and then rewrites the memory location with carefully selected patterns. As per its documentation available on the website:It Erases residue from deleted filesErases MFT and MFT-resident files (for NTFS volumes) and Directory Indices (for FAT)Powerful and flexible schedulerAll you need to do is right click on the file in place of delete use Eraser. If you are however a techie, you can always use command line utilities like sdelete. "

    "headline": "Bypassing biometrics using fingerprint – just a photo away",
    "data": "Bypassing Biometrics using FingerprintsAfter claiming to have broken the Apple touch ID back in 2013, Chaos Computer Club (CCC) has come back with yet another video upload on YouTube. The video simply talks about using pictures of fingerprints, to prove that one can reproduce the fingerprint to bypass biometrics. It is not fiction! One can simply use pictures to do this. Moreover, it is not like how in movies and TV shows a person records a fingerprint onto a tape-like material to crack through a biometric. This technique of fingerprint recreation is absolutely amazing!Bypass Fingerprint Biometrics The Cyber Threat Hacker     Could this be a paradise for hackers?Well, that is merely a question since biometrics is a norm in other parts of the world. But as far as India is concerned, the country has still not achieved the level of using biometrics for authentication. The rest of the world connects biometrics to bank accounts but India still uses no authentication Maestro cards. This is a sad state of affairs, indeed. Nonetheless, embedded below is a video of the CCC where they demonstrate how they were able to reconstruct a fingerprint.The Chaos Computer Club (CCC),  a European hacker association revealed their findings at a conference. The CCC is well-known for some of the scary stunts it has pulled and this time is no exception; they managed to reconstruct what they claim to be German Defence Minister Ursula von der Leyen’s fingerprint. Whatever they have managed to create, they claim, can fool standard biometric security software. All you need, the group said, is a standard camera and the VeriFinger fingerprint recognition software. Nonetheless, leaders in the future may have to keep in mind that gloves just may be an essential accessory, at least in the interest of national security. Perhaps in future, there may be a ban on news agencies from taking certain pictures where fingerprints can be clearly reproduced."

    "headline": "How Private is your information?",
    "data": "We might have often heard how unsafe it is to put your private information out in the public. In Social Media, we fill in forms and such things but we never listen, do we? The images below illustrate how and what private information is shared with the world because we are oblivious to those who have access to our information. A thief may know when you left home. An old girlfriend may know the places you travelled to, and even your boss may know whether you are sick and are actually staying home. A stalker who may be a stranger to you may know more about you via your Facebook profile. Or a loner who researches your interests on Twitter very closely can easily befriend you over similar likes and dislikes. How easily would you become a victim of fraud? More importantly, what is your checklist to protect your information from such people?When filling out any forms asking for private information, always check the authenticity of the website where you are providing your private and personal information. Ask yourself, Do you have to fill this?For social media websites (There’s going to be another section in detail about it), Pause for a moment and think before sharing or uploading a post. Ask yourself: 1) what is the scope of the post? 2) Who is receiving the update? 3) Should you limit the post’s visibility? or Should you remove the check-in? Should you limit your friend list and the visibility of your name on the network?   Picture Courtesy: http://www.whoishostingthis.com/blog/2014/11/12/public-private-data/"

    "headline": "Internet Statistics India, 2014: 100.82% Growth in Cyber Space",
    "data": "Internet Statistics India, 2014It so happens that this is the first post on The Cyber Blog India, so why not begin with something that is the driving force of this cyber space and the reason behind this start as well. It is not a hidden fact that the Indian digital market is not growing, it is like it took a head-start that is unending and growth is an understatement for this tremendous increase in Internet penetration. Let’s have a look at Internet Statistics of India.We saw all big giants enter into the telecommunications market, selling mobiles or internet services. Why?To mint money. This digital market has grown at a whooping rate of 100.82% in the last two years. Call this growth? The graphical representation that follows contains all the stuff you need to know, numbers, crimes and statistics.Facebook is adding a new user every one second. India has already exhausted its bandwidth for SIM connections. Standing at a 243 million strong internet users, India ranks second in the number of internet users in the world. Yay. We should be happy right?Sadly enough in a latest report by Akamai, the internet speeds in India are the slowest in Asia. Even then, the numbers are enchanting at the first look.At an average, an Indian spends about 5 hours per day online and 40% of that time on social media. 66 Million total users of these networks are also using these services via smartphones and tablets. So there is a fight among service providers to get the maximum numbers, among the smartphone companies to get the maximum users online. In all this hustle what is the relevance of any of this to a normal person who buys a device, then a connection and surfs happy. What has he to do with any of this.You may find tens of other posts highlighting the statistics but today, it is about digging deeper into why we need to understand this.\n1. The crime rate? Well, I’ll give you that. Let’s talk about it.\nThe crime rate if you see alone in the last one year i.e 2012-2013 as reported by NCRB has also increases by over 100%. One is prone to being a victim of cyber crimes(We’ll talk about that in a later post) like cyber stalking, identity theft, e-commerce crimes, frauds and such things a lot more when one is so active on the internet. Worse still, when one is on a mobile device the levels of security and standards understanding(That also in another post, in detail) is very low. So we are at threat.\n2. Keeping yourself safe\nAs the number of internet users also increase, we get more criminals online and more nationally and internationally acclaimed personalities, people we hate, people who loved us and then hate us, people looking for an oppurtunity to annoy us somehow and there are so many of them. All of them, a click away. When we write stuff on social media, when we access some webpage or do anything, we are sending packets of information from our device over a network which might or might not be safe. We might just get raided over the network only. Mostly, we wont be. But when we are through, we are vulnerable also. So just being aware of the law that might penalise one is not being aware, to use everything judiciously and the right way is also important. What to say and what not, how to behave, how to interact and so many other things, we must be aware about at all times.That is pretty much all for now. In further posts, I will take up some more issues and write about new developments as well.Internet Statistics in India 2014"
