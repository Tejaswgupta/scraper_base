Exemption of Living House: Section 60(1)(c) of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC) provides an exemption for the attachment of a living house or residential property from execution or attachment under a decree. However, this exemption applies to properties which are genuinely used as a residence and are not used for purposes of trade or business. The exemption is subject to certain conditions and may not be applicable in all cases.\n\n2. Revocation of Gift and Attachment: It is possible for a court to revoke a gift made before or during the pendency of a maintenance case if it is found to be made with the intent to deprive the other party of their legitimate share or to defeat the rights of a creditor. The court has the power to set aside such transactions and attach the property to satisfy the maintenance arrears. However, the court will consider the specific circumstances and evidence presented before making a decision.\n\nFor more Information you can contact me through Pathlegal by paying appropriate fees.\n\nPlease press LIKE button for appreciation.\n\nRegards,\nArunkumar Khedia\nAdvocate Bombay Highcourt.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFile a revision case in the High Court and seek a stay on the execution proceedings.\nM.

You cannot escape from paying maintenance, but you can try negotiating the amount subject to your income and circumstances. As the property is joint property, the court may ask or accept only your share in the property for attachment and derive maintenance. \n\nThank you, hope it helps. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

TANGEDCO has laid poles on my patta land without seeking NOC from me. As I have litigation with the same neighbor \"without frontage\", TANGEDCO knowing that I won't permit poles on my land, didn't bother to get NOC from me by simply laid the post without my knowledge.  I send a letter to them objecting this situation and got a reply that poles are going through not my land but through other adjacent person's land. \n\nThis is absurd, as the adjacent person has huge boundary wall and has no right to claim any land outside his 20ft tall compound / boundary wall. Adjacent person says that he has left 1.5ft or 2 ft of land outside his premises for white washing and maintenance of his 20ft height compound wall. TANGEDCO has used this as a loop hole and are now telling me that adjacent party provided NOC for laying poles. TANGEDCO has laid the poles within 1.5ft from the 20 ft compound wall.\n\n\n1. Is NOC from land owner required for laying EB poles ?   \n\n2. If NOC was not provided can EB still lay poles ?  \n\n3. In a likely situation that adjacent land owner providing a NOC, knowing that he has no right /claim to that land / extend, can TANGEDCO simply accept that and provide power supply ? Can I file RTI and ask for the NOC and supporting documents that was submitted, if any.\n\n\n4. Is there any tribunal with TANGEDCO to file a complaint and seek remedy ?\n\n5. Does TANGEDCO has any right to simply lay a pole on anyone agricultural land ? Do they have legal power to do so ?\n\n\nTANGEDCO - Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO).\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe TNEB line pole was on ur land correct ..! \n The nature of EB line was HET OR Normal line ..! \n This above said issues TANGEDO sent any representations towards officially ..! \n For ur objection towards the EB Line do u sent any representations to the TANGEDO..! \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t! yes .\n 2No .\n3 his NOC is invalid since he is not owner .\n 4 No but there are seniors .\n 5 NO\n File FIR for trespass\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear client \n\nYes, consent of owner is required for installation of electric poles. No, but it your case the Noc given by neighbor is sufficient as the 2 feet is owned by that person. You can file RTI and seek information. You can raise a complaint through their official website. TANGEDCO does not have any power to lay poles without any notice, they must provide prior notice to the landowners.  \n\nThank you, hope it helps. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn your case with TANGEDCO laying poles on your land, it's essential to know that an NOC from the landowner is usually required for such actions. If TANGEDCO proceeded without your NOC or based on a questionable NOC from an adjacent landowner, you have grounds to challenge it. File an RTI to access the NOC and related documents. You can lodge a complaint with TANGEDCO’s grievance redressal mechanism and, if needed, escalate to higher authorities or the electricity regulatory commission. TANGEDCO must respect property rights and follow legal procedures, so consider legal action with a property law expert to protect your rights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApproach the revenue department for fixation of Boundaries. Once the surveyor comes and demarcates your land, file a representation to the TANGEDCO to remove the poles. If not removed, you can approach the High Court with a writ petition.\nM. K.

He has no individual patta for his extend (i.e., no sub-division), but is on a joint patta.\n\nOccasionally, he says that he has left 1.5ft or 2 ft of land outside his premises for white washing and maintenance of his 20ft height compound wall. There is nothing in writing to support this claim. As he is a well-known person in the surrounding, Surveyor says that \"Yes, 1.5ft land is outside his compound wall\". There has no field measurements made so far and the well-known person will not apply for any land surveying. The compound wall is nearly 300 m long, which means the extend / area is significant, if this 1.5ft or 2 ft claim is to be accepted.\n\nHow can this be tackled ? How can anyone make a claim that he has 1.5 ft outside his boundary wall without any proper notification / agreement with the neighbor ? There is no boundary stone outside his compound wall.\n\nToday, he says 1.5ft and there is no guarantee that his next generations will stick to 1.5ft claim. They might come and say 2.0 or 2.5 ft ?\n\nIs there any previous argument / judgments that concludes that once boundary wall is laid, that shall be the boundary and any further extensions shall not be encouraged ?\n\nHow can I force this well-known person to apply for individual patta (meaning - asking him to sub-division his land). He has not done for nearly 30 years or so. I suspect that there is more land / extend inside his compound wall and he is not willing to make that public by requesting a sub-division. Can I apply for sub-division for him by paying 60Rs (on his behalf) by getting Certified Copy of document from Online ? Is this a violation ?\n\nThank You.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo u have separate patta copy or joint patta..?

Here are the answers to your questions:\n\n    Validity of Church-Issued Certificate:\n        The church-issued marriage certificate under the Indian Christian Marriage Act, 1872, is valid for legal purposes and is generally accepted as proof of marriage. However, for certain legal processes, including the visa application, authorities may require a marriage certificate issued by the government.\n\n    Government Issued Marriage Certificate:\n        In addition to the church-issued certificate, the couple may need to obtain a marriage certificate issued by the government. This is often available from the office of the Registrar of Marriages where the marriage was originally solemnized or registered.\n\n    Registrar's Office Location:\n\n        Since the marriage was solemnized in Delhi, the details of the marriage should be available at the Registrar of Marriages in Delhi. The couple can approach the Registrar's office in Delhi to obtain a government-issued marriage certificate.\n\n        However, if they have been residing in Noida, UP, they may also consider approaching the local Registrar of Marriages in Noida for information on the procedure to obtain a duplicate or certified copy of the marriage certificate. The local registrar may guide them on the process, and they may need to provide information such as the date of marriage and other relevant details.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear client, \n\nThe church issued marriage certificate is a valid document, but it is better to have a government marriage certificate as it sufficient for all purposes. You can get your government marriage certificate issued from the local registrar’s office. You can get the certificate in any place by providing your church marriage certificate. \n\nThank you, hope it helps. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAnswer to you all three questions is, a marriage certificate  issued by priest of Church is valid and legal document, can be used in all legal proceedings and visa purposes.

Where the appropriate Government does not make such a reference it shall record and communicate to the parties concerned its reasons therefor.\n\n(6) A report under this section shall be submitted within fourteen days of the commencement of the conciliation proceedings or within such shorter period as may be fixed by the appropriate Government: 3 Provided that, 4 subject to the approval of the conciliation officer,] the time for the submission of the report may be extended by such period as may be agreed upon in writing by all the parties to the dispute.]\n\n*****\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

Sending legal notice is usually less expensive and quick remedy with less time limit. Court procedures are lengthy , time consuming and expensive \n\nIf you have strong proofs/ evidences only then approach the court. Court provides justice based on evidences .

The burden of proof to prove the allegation is on the wife and court requires strong evidence such as eye witnesses, medical evidence, WhatsApp or email messages. If you were threatened that a case will be filed against you, that recordings or messages of threat can be used as evidence to convince the court to favor you. You can file defamation case on your wife when the court has convicted you for a falsely filed case on you and your family. If the court believes that it is a false allegation or does not convict you, court will impose penalty on your wife for misuse of law. You must prove beyond reasonable doubt that your wife is well educated and she is capable of earning or that previously she was earning but now has quit employment without a valid reason.  \n\nThank you, hope it helps. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

A lady in my work place repeatedly using the word sir everywhere in work place. This started when I said the same just once to someone. No correspondence of the same was provided to me as to why this was done. \n\nOther evidences too are there.\n\n\nAnd now they are trying to guess what I think too even though its impossible to prove. This is done by knowing everything about me and similar to techniques used by mentalists (magicians). They read body language almost instantaneously and will respond with due diligence. Schizophrenics too think the same(I have been called schizo by a doctor) but I have done some research and that's purely coincidence because sometimes my thoughts will too reflect in what I randomly hear in videos online but I have compared to what happened to me and that's not coincidence. It's impossible to prove to myself too, but given the evidences above, they must be doing it.\n\nNow these things about covertly reading minds can never be proven but surely they must be doing it because there are other clear evidences which I listed above.\n\nNow other people too think such thoughts including delusional thoughts about technology and stuff and I because of that, there is no way to compare these evidences with anything in Internet. Gangstalking etc. is never comparable. Any court cases(for gangstalking) etc. have always failed because either it was delusional or people have not bothered to take action and go to court. There is almost no similarity to these events except on rare postings online by someone. Random people behaving in persecutory way towards you for purpose of mental harassment or for making them look greater than you has never been challenged in courts because nobody may have any way forward to look up to.\n\nMoreover, there is no point thinking I am feeling harassed, because that is not the basis of why these actions I want to take. I take actions only on clear evidence.\n\nGiven the inputs that I have, please suggest what is the best way forward?

There's nothing wrong in updating the rent agreement as it will be beneficial for both, the landlord and you. When you don’t have a legal agreement with the landlord to stay in his property, he can throw you out. The contract/agreement between landlord and your father had ended with the death of your father, so your mother can give the necessary document and make a fresh rent agreement with landlord.  \n\nThank you, hope it helps. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It’s important to show her that you care about her feelings and that you want to work together to find a solution.\n2.\tCommunicate your own concerns: Let her know how you feel about the situation. Explain that your financial status is not strong enough to live separately and that you want to find a way to make the combined family work.\n3.\tSeek the help of a mediator: If you’re having trouble communicating with your wife, consider seeking the help of a mediator. A mediator can help you and your wife communicate more effectively and find a solution that works for both of you.\n4.\tConsider counseling: If the situation is particularly difficult, you may want to consider counseling. A counselor can help you and your wife work through your issues and find a way to move forward.\n5.\tJudicial separation: If all else fails, you may want to consider judicial separation. However, this should be a last resort, and you should try to work through your issues before taking this step.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you can convince her, that is the best choice.

As your financial status is not strong enough to live with her in other place, convincing and understanding would be a better option. Judicial separation may cause you to pay maintenance to your wife. If you feel it is impossible to convince your wife and also want to continue the marriage, you can go for judicial separation. \n\nThank you, hope it helps.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRespected \n\nSince it is family matter.

You have every right to live with your mohter and to look after her in her old ages and  in the same way you have every liberty to resist her demand of separate residence.  Since the legal issue as you stated in your problem itself is the mental circularity and for that you will get the relief and on the other hand looking agter aged parents is also an morel obligation with the family maintaining. \n\nBetter you seek for family settlement at first and if they failed, then proceed as according to your wish.  if ok you can contact us \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHi sir, either you go judicial separation or divorce ultimately you are entitled to give maintenance to her. further details you can contact me.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If the SHO has not registered the FIR then you can give your written complaint to the superintendent or higher authority. If the higher authority also fails to take action, you can file criminal complaint before the judicial magistrate or the metropolitan magistrate. Writ petition to high court or complaint to National Human Rights Commission or State Human Rights Commission are the other remedies available.  \n\nThank you, hope it helps.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This is a valid condition, as it does not violate any law or public policy, and it is possible to comply with.\nThe kind of document that you need to execute for this property transfer with condition is a gift deed.

You, your brother and mother being the parties to the agreement must agree to the condition and sign.

Due to too much politics from the top management, I put mail fot my resignation on November 2022. MD didn't accept my resignation and give me a new project, and I did that well, but at the same time they searched for a new person, and the MD's son's classmate was recriuted for my post in September 2023, and the management asked me to hand over all my new business, which I developed. I informed my MD that, as I expected the increment, you didn't put. Instead, I developed my skills in my own financial source (I did digital marketing) and developed a lot of new businesses. All the businesses that I have brought you have been transferred to others and developed them instead of mine.\n\nHe accepted my resignation as they got a new person and they gave me 60 days notice period November 7th. I handed over everything to took the new person who joined and properly handed over everything in month ended meeting on September 2023. They told me not to continue for October; they revised my notice period for 30 days and releived me earlier. \n\nThey hold my bonus and leave cash. They sent me my relieving order in WhatsApp, and they mentioned all the amounts were settled, but they didnt pay my leave cash and bonus.

Registration process is in stop condition, due to transition of the area from Gram Panchayat to Municipality is undergoing where the flat lies .  As the government process is taking time  and it has been more than an year for now after the token has been paid.  \n\nThe developer (JV  project land ower gets few flats in leu of his land) is ready to give possession after paying the full amount, and has agreed to execute a notarized document on Rs. 500 /- Stamp paper.\n\nSo my question \n\n1) Whether such  un-registered document is valied till the final sale deed gets registered ?\n2) Whether Rs. 500 /- Stamp paepr is sufficient to record the details.\n3) What should be the title of the document - whether Aggreeement to sale  or MOU or any thing else which you can suggest , which would have more legal weightage.\n4) In the above case how long the above aggreement to sale would be valid - I meant if the governemt would take another 2 yrs or so , will this document bind him to  execute the sale deed in favour of me or my legal heir or whoever I direct to register.\n5) Taking possession with full payment with documentation of the agreed on the stamp paper would be safe  or not .\n6)  What are the thing that would be extreme important to mention in the above executed document so that  finally it should be suitable to get it registered as sale deed for my title.\n7) Any advise or suggestion in this regard as It has been long waiting for 1yrs not getting the registration process started and have paid the token advance.\n8) Is un-registered agreement to sale is valid ?\n\nThanking you Sir / Madam.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlz contact in person, either through call or whatsapp or visit my office to discuss the entire issue in detail.\nThere are many legal implications in purchasing flats in Delhi region, since most of the areas are having recognised colonies.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPurchasing a flat in India typically involves a sequence of steps, including scrutinizing property documents, disbursing stamp duty and registration fees, executing a sale deed, and transferring the title. Presently, due to an administrative transition from Gram Panchayat to Municipality jurisdiction, the registration of new sale deeds has been suspended. In this context, you're considering purchasing a flat using an unregistered document executed on a Rs. 500/- stamp paper.\n\nRegarding the validity of such unregistered documents, they lack legal force in conveying property titles and cannot be the basis for ownership privileges, including tax benefits and home loan eligibility. They may merely indicate an understanding or receipt of payment without imposing legal obligations or conferring legal rights.\n\nAs for the adequacy of a Rs. 500/- stamp paper, it is unlikely to be sufficient for a property transaction considering the variance in stamp duty based on state regulations, property value, and other transaction specifics. Insufficient stamping can incur penalties or legal repercussions.\n\nIn terms of the document's nomenclature, an \"Agreement to Sell\" would possess more legal weight than a \"Memorandum of Understanding\" (MOU) due to its binding nature, which compels the completion of sale upon payment. Conversely, an MOU merely outlines the intent to negotiate in good faith without creating binding obligations.\n\nRegarding the Agreement to Sell's duration, its validity is usually defined within the agreement itself, which prescribes the transaction's completion timeframe. If unforeseen circumstances—like government delays—arise, parties are often bound to the agreement terms, provided extensions or renewals are stipulated within the agreement, ensuring that it doesn't lapse by default due to such delays.\n\nTaking full payment and possession under an unregistered document is risky, as it doesn't guarantee legal ownership or the benefits thereof. It opens up potential disputes or claims and disqualifies you from tax deductions, loans, or property insurance. Additionally, any complications or insolvency involving the seller could result in financial loss or property disputes.\n\nIn preparing for eventual registration, the unregistered agreement should explicitly include comprehensive details about the parties involved, property specifics, payment terms, possession details, title clarity, registration specifics, indemnities, and arbitration clauses, along with all pertinent annexes like tax receipts or no-objection certificates from authorities.\n\nWhile waiting for over a year for the registration process to begin, having paid a token advance, you are advised to seek expert legal advice, confirm the property and seller's credibility, document the sale terms carefully, pay due stamp duty and fees, and record all transactions and communications diligently. Once registration resumes, promptly finalize the sale deed to secure your ownership rights.\n\nLastly, it's crucial to note that while an unregistered Agreement to Sell documents the intent and payment, it lacks the enforcement power of a registered deed for actual property title transfer and the associated owner's benefits. Legal consultation is highly recommended to navigate these complexities and to safeguard your interests.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Such an order may have various legal consequences, such as affecting the person’s right to vote, contract, marry, inherit, etc.\nTo file an application for an unsound mind order, you need to follow the procedure prescribed by the law. According to Order XXXII of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), you need to sue by a next friend or guardian who has no interest adverse to yours and is a fit person to represent you. You also need to produce medical evidence and other documents to prove your condition. The court will then examine your case and pass an order accordingly.\nHowever, if you want to file an application personally for privacy reason, you may face some difficulties. First of all, you need to prove that you are capable of making your own decision and understanding the nature and consequences of your action. Secondly, you need to convince the court that your privacy interest outweighs the public interest and the interest of justice. Thirdly, you need to comply with the rules and formalities of filing an application in the court.\nTherefore, I suggest that you consult a lawyer who specializes in this field and get proper legal guidance. A lawyer can help you prepare your application, represent your case, and protect your rights and interests. \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear client,  \n\nUnder CPC order XXXII, Rules 1 to 14 apply to persons adjudged to be unsound mind while a suit is pending and applies to persons who are not adjudged so but are found to be incapable on court’s enquiry for any mental infirmity in protecting their interest when suing to being sued. A next friend must act on behalf of the unsound person, any person competent in law to make contract or a major and sound person can be a next friend. When a request is made to Magistrate & reasons exist to accept that the individual in the request is mentally unstable, unsound and not capable of proving his defense, magistrate will inquire into the facts of such person and unstable mind/unsoundness to decide.  \n\nThank you, hope it helps. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Does the grandson own the right to the property?\nAll property's owned by a Hindu person devolves onto his class one legal heir's. \n\nNow to the specific scenario's in ur example (for sake of convenience I'm presuming your grandfather has only one legal heir)\n\nSenario1: The property is self acquired by your Grandfather, in such case upon his demise intestate (without a will) the property would devolve upon ur Father and not you. In case your father passes away before your grandfather then in such case it would devolve upon you, your mother and ur siblings equally.\n\nScenario 2: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather father ( ur great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.\n\nScenario 3: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather grand father ( ur great great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.\n\nScenario 4: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfathers great grand father ( ur great great great grand farther) - then in such a case you would be entitled to the property by birth as it becomes ur ancestral property.\n\nTo give you more clarity on the concept of Ancestral Property's : any property which passes undivided down 4 generations of male lineage is called ancestral property. The right to such property acquires at birth unlike other laws of inheritance where right arises upon the death of the the owner.\n\nHope this brings some clarity to your question and your sense of entitlements.\nMeaning of ancestral property  in India-An ancestral property means a propertywhich is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father's fatheror father's fathers' father. ... That means when a coparcener acquires his share inancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it.\nMeaning of ancestral property in India-An ancestral property means a property which is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father’s father or father’s fathers’ father. It passes to the next three generations.\nMeaning of will-A will means a document in which a person specifies the method to be applied in management and distribution of properties after his death.\nThe basic principle involved is that the property should be four generations old. The right to use and acquire property is accrued by persons through birth itself. The division of property is per stripes i.e. that share of one generation is calculated first than the share of successive generations is subdivided according to share of their predecessor. These basic elements are for governing majorly the Hindus.\nIf A inherits property, whether movable or immovable, from his father or father’s father, or father’s father’sfather, it is ancestral property as regards his male issue. If A has no son, son’s son, or son’s son’s son in existence at the time when he inherits the property, he holds the property as absolute owner thereof, and he can deal with it as he pleases . A person inheriting property from his three immediate paternal ancestors holds it, and must hold it, in coparcenary with his sons, sons’ sons and sons’ sons’ sons but as regards other relations he holds it and is entitled to hold it, as his absolute property.”[1]\nNow answer to the question is that that will to ancestral property is not entirelyillegal. That means when a coparcener acquires his share in ancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it. However will shall be executed after the death of the testator and if the coparcener before acquiring a share makes a will than that will be illegal. Share in ancestral property will be inherited by coparceners. So he can make a will to his share in ancestral property.As whatever he acquires is his share now and he can dispose his assets according to his wishes.\nSurender Kumar vs Dhani Ram CS (OS) No.1737/2012 decided on 18th January, 2016 Hon’ble Mr. J. Valmiki Mehta of Delhi High Court ruled-\nIf a person dies after passing of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and there is no HUF existing at the time of the death of such a person, inheritance of an immovable property of such a person by his successors-in-interest is no doubt inheritance of an ‘ancestral’ property but the inheritance is as a self acquired property in the hands of the successor and not as an HUF property although the successor(s) indeed inherits ‘ancestral’ property i.e. a property belonging to his paternal ancestor.\n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me. I am at your service if you visit my office. \nPlease click on LIKE BUTTON.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear client, \n\nWhen grandfather dies without making a will, the property goes to the father and then to the grandchild from the father. A property is known as ancestral property when it has passed undivided for four generations. As the property here is grandfather’s property and not great grandfather’s property, it is not ancestral property and therefore son will not have any rights in that property against his father. If the father dies without making a will, all the legal hires will have equal rights in the property as per Indian succession act. \n\nThank you, hope it helps. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSince it’s considered as Ancestral property, son has the legal rights.

I'm an only child of my parents, who are deceased.\n\nI've been supporting myself through sex work. I've been doing so for the money - it's good and easy to earn. Sex work does not confine me to long working days, as a job does; plus, it earns me equally well, if not more, within a shorter timeframe. It affords me plenty of time for myself.\n\nMy relatives severed ties with me because of my profession. In fact, I have a \"cleric\" in my family, who has labeled me an \"apostate\" - both for my making a living through sex work and for my sleeping with men from \"other communities.\" Even though I've never renounced my faith and continue to practice it. This edict of his furthered the divide between me and my relatives.\n\nI recently received information that my relatives sold ancestral property that was in my paternal grandfather's name. My father's siblings took their share. However, my name as an heir of my father was intentionally left out. The property went for several crores of rupees.\n\nI contacted my relatives about this. However, they told me a \"prostitute\" has no right to property. They said I was an \"apostate,\" too, which further deprived me of any right I had to property.\n\nI feel cheated by my relatives. I want to know what the law says with regard to this and what I should do.\n\nRegards,\n\nHumaima\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNone can snatch away your legal right to inherit the ancestral property, being a legal heir, whatsoever may be your profession.

Under Section 12 of the Hindu Marriage Act, a spouse can seek annulment of marriage on certain grounds, including fraud or the concealment of facts. If a husband discovers that his wife hid information and there are grounds for annulment, he may choose to file a case under Section 12.\n\nHowever, it's essential to consult with a qualified legal professional to understand the specifics of your situation and the appropriate legal steps. The legal process for divorce or annulment can vary, and the time it takes to finalize a case depends on factors like court caseload and the complexity of the case.\n\nRegarding maintenance or alimony, Indian law considers various factors, including the financial needs of the dependent spouse, the standard of living, and the income of the paying spouse. The court aims to ensure fairness in its decisions.\n\nIt's important to note that the legal system strives to be impartial and fair, and judgments are made based on the presented evidence and legal principles. If you feel that the court has not considered relevant factors, it's crucial to discuss this with your legal representative.\n\nIt's also worth noting that societal attitudes and legal systems evolve over time, and efforts are made to address issues of fairness and justice in family law matters. If you have concerns about the legal system, you may want to engage in discussions with legal experts, policymakers, or advocacy groups working towards legal reforms.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nSec. 12 deals with impotency. While cheating is adultery.  In cases of adultery, you willl have to prove the adultery of the wife and then the court will decree divorce. It usually takes around 6 - 12months to decree divorce. \nWife who engages in adultery is not entitled to any maintenance or alimony. \nThank you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Yes, you can file execution petition even though appeal has been filed.\n2. Order 41 Rule 5 (1) CPC provides:\n\nRule 5. Stay by Appellate Court.— (1) An appeal shall not operate as a stay of proceedings under a decree or order appealed from except so far as the Appellate Court may order, nor shall execution of a decree be stayed by reason only of an appeal having been preferred from the decree; but the Appellate Court may for sufficient cause order stay of execution of such decree. So, the filing of appeal does not automatically operate as a stay of decree or order appealed from, unless Appellate court passes an order of stay.\n3. “Section 125(3) of the code would have to be held to be confined to the section which precedes it.” Section 128 of the Code provides for enforcement of the order of maintenance against the person against whom the order of maintenance has been made. The enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 can only be made upon the liability being satisfied by making actual payment of the amount of maintenance, which is due. The entitlement to claim enforcement of the order of maintenance under Section 128 by seeking discharge of the liability as per terms of the order of maintenance granted under Section 125, therefore cannot be held to be extinguished in terms of the one year limitation prescribed under the first proviso to Section 125(3).\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This means that the marriage of a girl below the age of 18 is considered to be child marriage and is prohibited by the law. There are certain contradictions to this rule in personal laws. However, it is important for you, as parents, to understand the importance of encouraging your daughters to continue their education and empowering them in other ways rather than marrying them off at a young age.\n•\tThe Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, 1971 lays down the law regarding abortion in India. Right now, it is not easy to get an abortion even in cases of rape as this Act sets a number of conditions. However, this Act is soon to be amended.\n•\tDomestic violence is prohibited by law and is considered to be a criminal offence according to S. 498-A of the Indian Penal Code. Certain provisions in the Indian Evidence Act and the Criminal Procedure Codealso deal with this issue. Finally, a legislation devoted to this issue was enacted in 2005 – The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act.\n•\tAnother common problem faced by married women is harassment from their in-laws for dowry. To battle this social evil, the Dowry Prohibition Act, 1961 was enacted, criminalising this practice. However, it still continues. It is important that parents do not give in to societal pressures and ensure that they do not provide dowry in any form.\n•\tWhile Indian law does not criminalise pre-marital sex as long as it is between consenting adults, there are no laws regulating live-in relationships. However, courts have developed laws on this subject through decisions in cases to such an extent that the law against domestic violence applies to couples who are in live-in relationships and children born out of such relationships are treated as legitimate in certain circumstances.\nSexual Abuse and Exploitation:\n•\tVarious forms of sexual harassment such as singing lewd songs, eve-teasing, making sexual advances in spite of refusal, watching, capturing or sharing images and other media of a woman engaging in a private act without prior consent have all been criminalised by the Indian Penal Code. There is an entire legislation dedicated to sexual harassment in the workplace – Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace Act, 2013.\n•\tAs parents, it is important that you are aware of your daughters’ activities on the Internet. Today, many crimes against women are committed by sexual predators through online portals. Online harassment of women is prohibited under S. 67 of the Information Technology Act.\n•\tAny indecent representation of women is banned by the Indecent Representation of Women (Prohibition) Act, 1986. This law, as it is considered to be too narrow for this day and age, has undergone certain changes and an Amendment Bill was drafted in 2012 which broadened its scope.\n•\tSs. 375 and 376(2) of The Indian Penal Code criminalise rape. These sections spell out 7 years’ and 10 years’ imprisonment, respectively, as the punishment for rape. The key feature of these sections is the requirement for consent by the woman in question for the act not to be considered as rape. Thus, as a parent it is important that you explain the concept of consent to your daughters at an early age. Intercourse with a woman of unsound mind or a girl below 16 years of age is considered to be rape irrespective of consent being given. Unfortunately, marital rape has not yet been criminalised.\nProperty Laws:\n•\tWhile traditionally, the rights of women with regard to succession and inheritance of property in India were next to non-existent, as of now, according to the amendments to the Hindu Succession Act in 2005, daughters have been given the same rights as sons with regard to inheritance and succession.\n•\tThe Indian Succession Act does not differentiate between the heirs of the deceased.\n•\tMuslim women enjoy rights of inheritance though limited to some extent by custom and practice.\nWomen in the Workplace:\n•\tWomen in India have the right to earn as much as men and gender discrimination is also prohibited at the time of recruitment. Ss. 4 and 5 of the Equal Remunerations Act, 1976 lay down the law regarding this.\n•\tThe Maternity Benefit (Amendment) Act, 2017 has brought about certain groundbreaking laws which concern working women including the increase of paid maternity leave from 12 weeks to 26 weeks (S.5(3)) and ‘work from home’ options for new mothers (S.5(5)).\nOrganisations that help:\nThere are a number of organisations that work for the upliftment and protection of women such as the National Commission for Women, One Stop Crisis Centres (or) Nirbhaya Centres, National Association of Rural Women India, etc. There are also a number of NGOs working for women’s rights. Please keep your daughter informed of these organisations so that she knows who to approach in case of a crisis.\nWhile keeping your daughter informed of her rights is a basic obligation of every parent, it is also important that you take a more active part in ensuring that your daughter has a better and happier future. By taking steps such as not providing dowry and by shifting the focus from marriage to education, you can do your part in breaking a cycle of abuse that has been going on for centuries. However, to ensure a complete change in society’s views on women, it is essential that you teach not only your daughters but also your sons to recognise the problems faced by women today and how to treat women with the respect that is their due.\n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

You will have to explain your situation that you cannot live in your relative's house, it is far from your workplace also. You can also mention that your relatives sometimes mistreat you for living there for free (Optional bt effective).\nThe conclusion is that say whatever you can to sound pitiful and prove domestic violence and ger separate residence orders.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Madam\nAs a married woman , you are eligible for your legal right of maintenance from your husband. He has no right to desert you without a reason and if he has done it, then you must file for RCR [restitution of conjugal rights ] Under Section 9 of the Hindu Marriage Act in which court will send him notice and call him to reunion with you and you can also file for maintenance under section 125 of The criminal Procedural Code and court will order your husband to pay for your maintenance and livelihood . \nYou could also send him a legal notice to inform him your intention of reunion and problem of burdening others if you are hesitant to file a court case directly. Since you want to save your marriage , sending a legal notice is a safer option wherein all your issues can be clearly put across and if he fails to adhere and comply, then you can take the steps of approaching Court. \nSince i have my specialization in family matters, i wish to inform you that law is extremely favorable for woman. So it is time you take some action to save your marriage than wasting time in delay. For any further assistances you may contact me via phone consultation or meeting . Delay of action is delay of justice. Beware and Goodluck !!!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI think your query has already been addressed earlier. You may still get in touch with me for a detailed discussion in your matter.\n\nRegards,\nBidhayak Acharyya\nAdvocate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

I advise that you appear in the court, to prevent any stay or revision orders from being passed in your absence.\n2.  Separate revision petition must be filed to increase the amount. Objection is only to stay order.\n3. This may be the case, it is very likely that he has done this.  Get arrears of maintenance and then file appeal against RCR. Also, make sure to show cause to the court that you want your maintenance overdues first and only then you will shift. Say that it is like a security, if i join RCR and then he leaves me again, I do not have the money to go through the proceedings again.\nThank you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Divorce proceedings to finalise will take around 1  year.\nMaintenance is there even for a cruel wife, law does not say that if the wife is cruel she is not entitled to maintenance. Arguing against maintenance to cruel wife has not been recognised yet, so you cannot ask against the maintenance. Maintenance order could be give in the middle of the proceedings (interim) or at the end of the proceedings.\nThe amount of maintenance depends on your income, standard of living, education of the wife etc.\nThank you\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It involves the court appointing a commissioner to investigate and report on the specific circumstances and living conditions of the parties involved in the RCR case.\n\nThe purpose of this investigation is to determine whether the party seeking restitution of conjugal rights (usually one of the spouses) is justified in seeking the court's intervention to restore conjugal rights, which generally means requesting that the other spouse returns to the matrimonial home and resumes cohabitation. The commissioner may visit the homes of the parties involved, interview them, and gather relevant information.\n\nThe commissioner's report can provide valuable insights to the court when deciding on the RCR case. If the commissioner's report suggests that the conditions are favorable for reconciliation and resumption of cohabitation, it may influence the court's decision in favor of the party seeking restitution of conjugal rights.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCourt appointments court commissioners among advocates to inquire abt certain and actual positions of any situation or status and produce the hus report befor the court on certain dates to decide or order based on actual status .. and for what actually this commissioner is appointed this can be seen coirt order shweta.. for this you can take help of any lawyers .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir/Madam \nYour question is very brief, as per my understanding there is only await mediation report which is usually followed in court practice .This happens when your case is refereed for mediation and once mediation period is completed , the judge needs the final mediation report if the mediation is passed with a final agreement or is it failed . \nUsually warrants are issued only when maintenance is not paid by husband to wife. \nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

YEs, you can file execution petition for the maintenance order (not for non-deposit of money in court). First, go the same court that gave order and apply for execution petition. Show that you have not received any money and that the husband has source of income to pay you. \n4. YEs, you must challenge this order for it is only a gimmick. You can present audio recordings as evidence in the Court through your lawyer.

There is no anticipatory bail for a proclaimed offender, so applying for it is a waste. \n2.  Better to apply to High Court. \n3. Once the  PO order has been squashed they cannot arrest you unless you have been declared guilty in the proceedings.

Women marriage with men in India for their property and bank balance for fulfill their own greed and benefits then exploit men and get huge amount from men as maintenance or alimony.Women blackmail men put false allegations on men and demand huge amount of money from men. it is a reality of today's society. Women centric laws in India , Indian law makers , Indian judicial system and law enforcement agencies all are responsible for it.Women centric laws completely ruined the lives of Indian men Due to this most of men commit suicide.Why Indian law makers , law enforcement agencies , Indian judicial system not stop it and encourage it by making another women centric laws in India.Why law enforcement agencies and Indian judiciary register false case and false FIR.From their experience Indian law enforcement agencies and Indian judiciary before registration of case and FIR it is false or real then why they register it reason is for making money.If it happens with them and in their families then they will reliaze how painful and embarrassing it is. Other countries treated their all citizens equally both in document and implementation in other countries national and state for men and women are available but in reverse in India only national and state commission for woman is available no national and state man commission is available.

These formalities include:\n\nConsent of Parties: The biological parents (if alive) or the legal guardians must willingly give the child in adoption, and the adopting parents must willingly accept the child for the adoption to be valid.\n\nTransfer of Rights: There should be a transfer of parental rights from the biological parents or guardians to the adoptive parents. This is generally expressed in a deed of adoption.\n\nRegistration: HAMA requires the adoption deed to be registered. The deed should also be signed by the parties involved and attested by at least two witnesses.\n\nNo Specific Ceremony: While there is no strict requirement for a specific \"giving and taking\" ceremony, some families may choose to have a formal or customary ceremony to mark the adoption.

While a kitchen knife is not a firearm, it can still be subject to scrutiny under the Act, particularly if it's being carried for self-defense.\n\nRules and Licenses: The Arms Rules, 1962, provide further details and regulations regarding the possession, acquisition, and carrying of arms. To carry a weapon legally in public places, you would typically need a valid license issued by the local licensing authority.\n\nIntent and Use: It's essential to understand that carrying a kitchen knife or any other object with the intent of using it as a weapon for self-defense might not be viewed favorably under the law. The law generally does not encourage individuals to take the law into their own hands.\n\nAlternatives: Instead of carrying potentially dangerous items for self-defense, you should consider non-lethal alternatives. Personal safety items like pepper spray, personal alarms, or self-defense courses are options that are typically less restricted by the law and can provide you with a degree of protection.\n\nLocal Regulations: Laws can vary by state and locality in India, so it's important to check with local law enforcement or legal authorities to understand specific regulations that may apply in your area.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nYou sound like you are planning something. \nYes, it is illegal in India, but you will not be punished unless someone accuses you of carrying a knife, or you are discovered with one during a formal or routine search by the police or by a private individual.  According to the Act, no one in India is permitted to carry a knife with a blade length of more than 9 inches and a width of more than 2 inches, and such a weapon must be fancy enough to be perceived as a threat by the general public.\nEven mere brandishing or discharge of firearms or blank-firing firearms in any public place or a firearm free zone is strictly prohibited. \nYou can only carry small stuff like that foldable blade, pepper spray, etc.\nThank you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinstead of kitchen knife carry,  pen knife much safer to keep and to use . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You will have to show proof that your earnings are not as much, she is earning enough, etc. \nThe Court normally transfers the case as per the choice of wife, for it is believed that the wife cannot it will be difficult for her etc. So, there is not much that you can do about it except like claiming Right to equality (wife be treated same as husband in transfer proceedings ) which is again upto the discretion of the court. \nAbout the issue of summons to the workplace, there is no provision to stop that. \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo need to seek amendment of complainant, you can simply declare that you are giving up claim to maintenance.

Ex parte decisions are given by the Court at its own discretion we cannot fix a time period, but it can take anywhere around 1 year.\n3. yes, you should wait for one year atleast so that the divorce becomes unchallenged. Otherwise you can be held for bigamy if your wife appeals the challenge.\n4. Yes, she can appeal. The normal questions would be questions of law like delay, fraud, misrepresentation to the court etc. \n5. That depends on your earnings, your standard of living, wife's standard of living before an dduring marriage, educational qualifications etc. \n7. It has been allowed to wife as a right to get the proceedings transferred to the place where she lives, in most of the cases, the courts accept the transfer. There is not much you can do except saying that this is the place where jurisdiction lies, i cannot travel to that place, i am disabled etc.\n8. Yes, the wife is still entitled to maintenance. The law does not think that women can be cruel and therefore, the burden of paying maintenance is only on the man. \n9. You can be jailed or your property may be used to pay such arrears, advised not to do this.\n10. It can take 6 months to 1 year.\n11. If the marriage is void, then there arises no question of paying maintenance. If a marriage is declared void, it is like the marriage never happened. You can say that you were never married ( legally, ethically you will still be married once)\n12. There is no sec 142 that relates to marriage. If you mean Article 142, it is discretionary jurisdiction of the Supreme court. It can take up your case or not.  It usually takes 3 to 6 months.\n13.

These plans should have accounted for access to all pre-existing land parcels, including yours. You need to approach the authorities explain your situation (by way of written representation), and request an official access route to your land. In some circumstances, they may have provisions for granting access to landlocked properties. If all these measures fail, you may need to take legal action to obtain the order for the creation of an easement to access your land.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

When, this charge is created she will either get maintenance from the house thrhough rent or she will have the capacity to sell the house and recover her arrears of maintenance. \nYour brother's share cannot to be touched by the court, only your share in the house will be considered.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou may opt for insolvency to defeat claim of wife on account of maintenance etc. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Their household activity starts around 6am and goes till 9am. During this time there is noise of chairs etc. dragging, putting of heavy object on the floor etc. These noises are not continuous but on intermittent interval gap of 20-25 mins. However they are loud enough to wake someone from sleep.\n      I tried talking to the tenant but he is arrogant. Even talking to the owner didn't help. I am not expecting any output from society association because as per them the silent hours is from 10pm to 6am. 'But does that mean disturbance can be done post 6am??'\n      My senior citizen father doesn't experience the sound much as he is in other room and also he wakes up early.

You have the option to call the police by just dialing the police number 100 and police will come to the place mentioned by you in the phone call. They will come to the spot and ask you the problem and then will take the action against them. And, when they will reach the spot you should be having sufficient proof to prove the harassment by neighbors.\nHarassment Through Nuisance\nYou may be living in an apartment or in a duplex, often it happens, when you hear loud music sound from the neighbor’s house, you try to ignore that sound for as long as possible but sometimes, such noise may make life difficult. This type of nuisance is defined in Section 268 of the Indian Penal Act.\nSection 268 of the Indian Penal Code defines nuisance when the person is guilty of a public nuisance when he does any act which causes injury, danger or annoyance to the public or the people in general who live or occupy the property in the neighborhood.\nA common nuisance is not excused on the ground that it causes some convenience or advantage.\nIf this type of harassment is faced by you from your neighbor then, you can file an application under Section 268 of IPC in the court of magistrate.\nPunishment of nuisance is defined in Section 290 of IPC, which is mere Rs. 200 but the court can do much more.\nAs a matter of fact, calling 100 is most effective as, after a visit or two from the police, such nuisance is likely to stop. In extreme cases, police may even confiscate the instruments that are used to cause nuisance like – loudspeakers or sound boxes, or drones, cameras or such other tools.\nSometimes, police does not intervene despite laws being there as they do not like extra work on their plate or because the other party is very influential. In such cases, you may need to take help of legal experts. We recommend you get in touch with ClikLawyer.com.\nHarassment Through Mischief\nWhen you live in a duplex, you are sharing a common wall. If your neighbor starts construction in that common wall you do not have the right to stop him from constructing because it is his legal right but if during the construction work your property gets damaged, you can ask him to compensate for the loss suffered by you but if your neighbor refuses to pay you the amount then you can file a case under –\nSection 425 of IPC which states that whoever with intent to cause, or knowing that he is likely to cause, wrongful loss or damage to the public or to any person, causes the destruction of any property, or any such change in any property or in the situation thereof as destroys or diminishes its value or utility, or affects it injuriously, commits mischief.\nYou can file suit for declaration and mandatory injunction in a civil court as well.\nYou can claim damages in the same suit.\nTHE KARNATAKA POLICE ACT, \n(similar State Police Act also existing in each State)\n92.

Plus, Gifts to blood relatives, as inheritance, as marriage gifts, or in contemplation of death, are generally not taxable. There are no tax benefits for a 'transfer' under Relinquishment Deed.\n Moreover, it is just as challengable as a release deed. So, it functions just like release deed.

The MCI can take disciplinary actions against doctors for professional misconduct.\n\n    Submit a Complaint to the State Medical Council:\n        Each state in India has its own Medical Council. You can file a complaint with the State Medical Council where the doctor is practicing. The State Medical Council has the authority to investigate and take appropriate action.\n\n    Approach the District Health Officer or Chief Medical Officer:\n        If the local Chief Medical Officer of Health (CMOH) has not taken action, you may consider approaching higher authorities in the health department, such as the District Health Officer or the Commissioner of Health.\n\n    Legal Action:\n        Consult with a lawyer to explore legal options. Depending on the circumstances, there may be provisions under the bond agreement or employment contract that can be enforced through legal means.\n\n    Whistleblower Protection:\n        If you fear retaliation for reporting the violation, be aware that there are whistleblower protection laws in place. The Protected Disclosures Act, 2014, provides protection to whistleblowers in the public interest.\n\n    Document the Violation:\n        Keep records of the violation, including any evidence such as photographs, witness statements, or other relevant documentation, which can be useful during an investigation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nYou can file a case against the, for corruption as engaging in private practice is an offense.

To address this situation and ensure compliance with the relevant regulations, you may consider the following steps:\n\nReview the Bond Agreement: The terms and conditions of the bond agreement signed by the doctor should be examined carefully. This will outline the specific obligations and restrictions placed on the doctor during the service period.\n\nContact the Medical Council: You can contact the State Medical Council or the Medical Council of India, or the respective regulatory body responsible for overseeing medical practitioners in your region. Provide them with the relevant information and documents regarding the doctor's private practice during the bond period.\n\nLodge a Formal Complaint: Prepare a formal written complaint detailing the doctor's actions, providing evidence, and sending it to the appropriate medical regulatory authority. They will investigate the matter and take appropriate action.\n\nContact Legal Authorities: If the regulatory authorities do not respond or take action, you may want to consult with a legal expert, such as a lawyer specializing in medical law. They can advise you on potential legal actions you can take against the doctor.\n\nWhistleblower Protection: Ensure that you and any other individuals involved in reporting the violation are protected under any applicable whistleblower protection laws. These laws exist to safeguard individuals who report misconduct.\n\nDocument Everything: Maintain a record of all relevant communications, evidence, and interactions related to the case. This documentation can be crucial if legal action is required.\n\nIt's essential to follow the proper legal procedures and regulations to address this issue effectively. Violating the terms of a bond agreement and practicing medicine without authorization can have serious consequences for the doctor in question, but it's crucial to go through the appropriate channels to address the matter. Consulting with legal experts and the relevant regulatory bodies will help you take the right steps to resolve the issue.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Petition to medical council of India . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nfile a complaint in the state and national medical council\nif failed file a case in the court restraining him from practicing further \nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This is important for clarity, transparency, and to give notice to the other party and the court about the legal basis for the relief sought.\n\nRegarding Section 6 of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC), it provides for exclusion of time in certain cases. It states that the time spent by a defendant in obtaining a copy of a summons in an earlier suit shall be excluded in computing the time for filing a written statement. This provision is independent of the Limitation Act, 1963.\n\nNow, with respect to the Limitation Act, 1963, Section 4 to Section 20 deals with various aspects of computation of limitation. While it is generally good practice to mention the relevant provisions in the plaint for clarity, the failure to expressly plead these sections may not necessarily preclude the court from considering them if their application is apparent from the facts presented.\n\nCourts are often guided by the principles of substantial justice, and they may take cognizance of provisions related to limitation even if not expressly mentioned in the plaint. However, it is always safer and more effective to make explicit references to the relevant sections in the plaint to avoid any ambiguity.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nYou have to raise the issue of limitation in your arguments.

Here are some general points to consider:\n\nRight to Information (RTI): In many countries, including India, the Right to Information Act allows citizens to request and obtain information from government authorities, including documents related to government actions, decisions, or applications. You mentioned that you have submitted an RTI request, and if they are not providing the information, you can consider pursuing an appeal through the RTI process.\n\nElectricity Board Regulations: Electricity boards or distribution companies often have their own policies regarding document disclosure. These policies may be guided by applicable laws and regulations. You should check the specific regulations of the Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation (TANGEDCO) to understand their obligations regarding document disclosure.\n\nLegal Counsel: Consult with a lawyer who specializes in administrative and regulatory law in your jurisdiction. They can help you navigate the specific legal requirements and options available to obtain the documents you need.\n\nRTI Appeal: If your initial RTI request has been denied, you can pursue an appeal as you mentioned. This is a formal process that may require some time, but it can be an effective means of obtaining information that the authorities are reluctant to provide.\n\nComplaint to Regulators: Depending on the nature of your issue, you may consider lodging a complaint with the regulatory authority overseeing the electricity sector in your area. They may have the authority to compel the electricity board to provide the requested documents.\n\nPublic Interest Litigation (PIL): In some cases, if the matter is of public interest and involves a broader issue of abuse of power or illegal activity by a public authority, a Public Interest Litigation can be filed in court to seek the release of the requested documents.\n\nPatience and Persistence: Dealing with bureaucratic processes can be time-consuming, but persistence in following the legal channels and rules is often the key to obtaining the documents you seek.\n\nRemember that the legal framework and procedures can vary from one place to another, so it's essential to work with a legal professional who is well-versed in the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. They can provide you with tailored advice and help you navigate the process effectively.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nIf the applicant does not receive the response for the RTI, within 30 days (or 35 days in case the application was transferred to another department or was submitted to APIO) of submitting the application, then the applicant can file for an appeal. An appeal can also be filed if the applicant is not satisfied with the response for the RTI.\nHowever, the appeal must be filed within 30 days of expected date of response or the date when he response was received.\nOR you can file a petition to High Court regarding the violation of your Right to Information guaranteed under Sec 19(1)(a). \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\n1.

If they deny this without valid exemptions under the RTI Act, file an appeal to the higher authority. Should this not resolve the issue, approach the State Information Commission for intervention. For the alleged fabrication of documents, consider legal action, and consult with a lawyer specializing in electricity laws and RTI. Gather all relevant communications and applications to support your case. Persist with RTI appeals, as it's a crucial tool for ensuring transparency.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The punishment under this section can include imprisonment and a fine.\n\n2. Section 218 - Public servant framing incorrect record or writing with intent to save person from punishment or property from forfeiture: If a police officer forges documents with the intention to save a person from punishment or property from forfeiture, they may be charged under this section.\n\n3. Section 220 - Commitment for trial or confinement by a person to prejudice of that person: This section deals with a public servant who, without any lawful authority, commits a person for trial or confinement, which may include falsifying documents or complaints.\n\n4. Section 465 - Forgery: This section deals with the act of forgery, including the creation of false documents. It is a general provision in the IPC regarding forgery.\n\n5.

Section 471 - Using as genuine a forged document: If the forged documents are used as genuine, this section may be invoked against the person who uses them.\n\n7. Section 477A - Falsification of accounts: If the forgery involves falsifying accounts, this section may be applicable.\n\nIt's important to consult with a legal expert or an advocate.

From 2009, it is mandatory to send a notice first and then if the accused does not comply, he can be arrested. Even if the case was dismissed against you ask for the copy of the order and if you find it unreasonable file an appeal. It is important, for a lady constable to be present while arresting a woman and a woman cannot be arrested in the night or early morning, check the timings of arrest.\n2. As per the law, the police can arrest or investigate an accused lying within the boundaries of their state. For arresting an accused of some other state, the police force needs to communicate with the police force of that particular state .\n3. yes, a woman constable was necessary and important. Also, check if she was arrested in the time after sunset. A woman cannot be arrested after sunset (generally, 6pm) and before sunrise (generally, 6am), even if a woman police officer is present (Section 46(4) of Criminal Procedure Code).\n4. You have to appeal against the previous order and highlight this unlawful arrest and detention. \n5. See, even 3 months of stay together is considered for DV Act. You have to prove that he loved her and he was good to her always. If you have proof of instances where he has asked her to come back or neighbour's testimony that he was good to his wife. You should file a restitution case so that she can come back (if you want her back) or else you should get a divorce for cruelty by false accusations and unreasonable withdrawal from marital house. She will not be entitled to maintenance if you can prove that she left with her own will for no good reason and the husband tried to get her back.  \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is really unfortunate to know that your friend and his mother had to suffer so much due to misinformation.\nThey should have engaged an Advocate to mitigate unnecessary harrassment and humiliation.\nHowever, arrest is made when neither the Accused himself/themselves nor his/their counsel appear before the court in a criminal case.\nThough, the police has violated certain guidelines issued in DK Basu v. State of West Bengal case, for which legal action can be taken.\nBut the first thing is that the FIR either needs to be quashed or contested.\n\nYou may contact me for professional consultation through call or whatsapp to discuss in detail.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It's essential to note that divorce in Islamic law can be both through judicial and extra-judicial means. If a husband wishes to initiate a divorce from his wife outside of the judicial system, the procedure can vary depending on the specific school of thought within Shia Islam (e.g., Twelver Shia, Ismaili Shia).\n\nHere are some general guidelines for an extra-judicial divorce in Shia Muslim law:\n\nTalaq (Divorce): The husband can initiate divorce by pronouncing the word \"Talaq\" three times in separate intervals. This is known as the \"Triple Talaq.\" However, it's important to note that many Shia scholars and jurisdictions have specific rules and conditions regarding the use of Triple Talaq. In some Shia traditions, the husband may need to give a single Talaq, and then there is a waiting period (Iddah) before proceeding with the final two pronouncements.\n\nIddah (Waiting Period): After the pronouncement of divorce, there is a waiting period (Iddah) during which the wife cannot remarry. The length of the Iddah varies depending on the wife's circumstances. During this period, the wife remains in her husband's house and is entitled to financial support.\n\nArbitration: Some Shia traditions require the involvement of two arbitrators (Adil or just individuals) to help mediate the divorce process and determine issues related to financial support, custody of children, and property division.\n\nWritten Declaration: In some Shia traditions, it is advisable to have a written declaration of divorce signed by the husband, and sometimes witnessed by two individuals.\n\nKhula: In Shia law, a wife can also initiate a divorce by seeking a Khula. This is a process where the wife offers compensation to the husband in exchange for her release from the marriage.\n\nConsent: In extra-judicial divorces, the consent of both parties is typically required.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that the specific rules and procedures may vary among different Shia communities and regions. Additionally, the laws and regulations governing marital issues can be influenced by local customs and practices. It is advisable for individuals seeking an extra-judicial divorce to consult with a knowledgeable religious scholar, a local mosque or religious authority, or a legal expert familiar with Shia Muslim family law to ensure that the divorce process is conducted in accordance with the applicable traditions and legal requirements.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In a Hindu Undivided Family (HUF), coparceners have a right to the ancestral property by virtue of birth. The Mitakshara coparcenary system is prevalent in India, where property is inherited by descendants automatically, and they have a right to it from birth.\n\nIf a partition is made through a will, it might impact the traditional rights of coparceners. Typically, coparceners have a right to ask for a share in the ancestral property, and any testamentary disposition might affect this right. Legal implications and challenges could arise, and it's advisable for individuals involved to seek legal advice to ensure a fair and legal distribution of the property.\n\nIn essence, coparceners may have concerns about the validity and fairness of the partition if it's done through a will, as it may deviate from the customary rules of inheritance in a coparcenary.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

CrPC Section 157 does not explicitly require submitting an occurrence report to a magistrate before initiating an investigation. Instead, it outlines the procedure for the investigation of cognizable offenses by the police.\n\nRegarding the question of sanction for the prosecution of government employees, that requirement is generally covered under CrPC Section 197. This section mandates that in certain cases, prior sanction is needed from the appropriate authority before prosecuting a public servant for acts done as part of their official duty. This provision is in place to protect government employees from frivolous or malicious prosecutions that may hinder the discharge of their official duties.\n\nSo, in the case of a government employee, if the alleged crime is related to the actions taken in the discharge of their official duty, the investigating agency usually needs to obtain sanction from the appropriate authority before initiating the prosecution.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo sanction is required before investigation .

In your situation, it may be prudent to consult with a legal professional who specializes in employment and labor law to get specific guidance based on your circumstances. Here are some steps you could consider taking:\n\nConsult an Employment Attorney: Given the complexity of your situation and the legal intricacies involved, it's essential to consult with an employment attorney who can provide you with guidance specific to your case and the laws and regulations applicable in your jurisdiction.\n\nReview Your Organization's Policies: Carefully review your organization's policies, procedures, and the terms of your employment contract to understand your rights and obligations. Ensure that the disciplinary actions are consistent with the policies and agreements in place.\n\nDocument Everything: Document all interactions, correspondence, and incidents related to your situation. This includes records of your sexual harassment complaint, your medical condition, and any communication with your employer.\n\nRetaliation Claim: If you believe that the disciplinary actions are in retaliation for your sexual harassment complaint, discuss the possibility of filing a retaliation claim with your attorney. Retaliation for making a harassment complaint is generally prohibited under employment laws.\n\nRequest Internal Review: Depending on your organization's policies, you may have the option to request an internal review or appeal of the disciplinary actions. Discuss this option with your attorney.\n\nFile a Grievance: Consider filing a formal grievance with your employer, outlining the reasons you believe the disciplinary actions are unwarranted or unjust. Seek the advice of your attorney in this process.\n\nLabor Department Complaint: If internal remedies do not yield satisfactory results, you may explore filing a complaint with the labor department or employment rights agency in your jurisdiction.\n\nLegal Action: If all other avenues are exhausted and you believe your rights have been violated, you may need to consider taking legal action, such as filing a lawsuit. Your attorney can advise you on the most appropriate course of action.\n\nKeep in mind that challenging disciplinary actions can be a complex and time-consuming process, but consulting with an experienced employment attorney is a crucial first step. They can help you navigate the legal aspects of your case, assess the strength of your claims, and guide you on the most effective actions to take to protect your rights and interests.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

What’s The Inheritance Procedure Concerning NRI’s Property In India?\nGuiding Businesses\n\nCan A Foreign Citizen Inherit A Property In India? What’s The Inheritance Procedure Concerning NRI’s Property In India?\n\nWho can inherit property\nIndian citizens can inherit properties in India without any restrictions. However, when we talk about foreign citizens and Indian citizens living abroad, the situation is not the same. To understand the law regarding inheritance of such persons, we need to understand the following terms:\n\nForeigner: The term foreigner has been defined in the Foreigners Act, 1946 as ‘a person who is not a citizen of India’.\nNRI: In simple terms, Non-Resident Indian (“NRI”) can be defined, as an Indian citizen who has relocated to another country, which is no longer ‘resident’ in India. More clarity regarding this can be found in the Income-tax Act, 1961, which does not directly define NRI but defines who can be considered as a resident in Section 6. Therefore, interpreting the section, the following criteria can be laid down for someone to be considered as NRI:\nA person who has stayed less than 182 days in the current financial year in India; or\nA person who has stayed in India for less 365 days in the preceding four years and has stayed less than 60 days in that current financial year.\nIf a person fulfils even one of the above-mentioned conditions, he shall be regarded as a ‘non-resident.’\n\nFEMA defines a person resident in India as\n\na person residing in India for more than one hundred and eighty-two days during the preceding financial year but does not include:\n\n (A) a person who has gone out of India or who stays outside India, in either case—\n(a) for or on taking up employment outside India, or\n\n(b) for carrying on outside India a business or vocation outside India, or\n\nc) for any other purpose, in such circumstances as would indicate his intention to stay outside India for an uncertain period;\n\n(B) a person who has come to or stays in India, in either case, otherwise than—\n\n(a) for or on taking up employment in India, or\n\n(b) for carrying on in India a business or vocation in India, or\n\n(c) for any other purpose, in such circumstances as would indicate his intention to stay in India for an uncertain period;\n\n(2) any person or body corporate registered or incorporated in India,\n\n(3) an office, branch or agency in India owned or controlled by a person resident outside India,\n\n(4) an office, branch or agency outside India owned or controlled by a person resident in India;\n\nForeign Exchange Management Act, 1999 uses the term “person resident outside India”  for NRIs and defines it as a person who is not resident in India.\n\nPIO: The Ministry of External Affairs defines Person of Indian Origin (PIO) as a foreign citizen (except a national of Pakistan, Afghanistan Bangladesh, China, Iran, Bhutan, Sri Lanka, and Nepal):\nWho at any time held an Indian passport; or\nEither of their parents/ grandparents/ great grandparents were born and permanently resident in India as defined in Government of India Act, 1935 and other territories that became part of India thereafter provided neither was at any time a citizen of any of the aforesaid countries ( as referred above); or\nWho is a spouse of a citizen of India or a PIO\nThe economic, financial, and educational benefits given to them are usually at parity with NRIs.\n\nWho can they inherit from\nNRIs, PIO, and even foreign citizens can inherit any type of property, including movable and immovable property, i.e. commercial, agricultural, and residential. It is pertinent to note that NRI cannot acquire agricultural land, farmhouse, and plantation property in India, but they can inherit the same subject to certain restrictions. They can also inherit properties from other NRIs and PIOs if certain conditions are fulfilled. Therefore, they can inherit property from two categories of people:\n\nAny person resident in India; or\n\nA person resident outside India\nOne of the things required to enable NRIs to inherit the property is that the property, at the time of the purchase, should be in compliance with the relevant laws. That is the person bequeathing the property should have complied with the Foreign Exchange Management Act (“FEMA”) Regulations or any other foreign exchange law in force at the time of acquisition of the property in question. Non-compliance with the same can result in non-inheritance of the property.\n\nIn what ways can they inherit the property?\nAs a general rule, people, including NRIs, can inherit a property in the following ways:\n\nWill: One of the ways that NRIs can inherit properties in India is through a Will. NRIs themselves can transfer the property to other NRIs by making through a Will. However, in the said circumstance, the permission of RBI will be required.\nIntestate: If a person dies intestate, i.e. without a Will, then the inheritance process can get a little difficult.

IF any buyer approaches you then you can make it clear to him that it is not under dispute. If it turns out to be disputed, then you can promise for the sale to be void and money in transaction be given back to you.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you have legal ownership documents for the land and the temple located on the land is also legally owned by you, there should be no dispute regarding the ownership of the property. However, to proceed with the sale or mortgage of the land smoothly, it's essential to follow these steps:\n\nCheck Property Titles: Ensure that the property titles, ownership documents, and records are in order. Make sure that you have clear and legal ownership of both the land and the temple.\n\nConsult a Lawyer: It's advisable to consult with a local lawyer who specializes in property and real estate matters. They can review your documents, confirm the property's legal status, and provide guidance on the sale or mortgage process.\n\nTitle Search: Conduct a title search to confirm that there are no encumbrances, legal disputes, or claims against the property. This will help ensure that the property is free and clear of any issues that could hinder a sale or mortgage.\n\nNotify Local Authorities: Inform the local authorities, including the village or municipal office, about your intention to sell or mortgage the property. This can help address any concerns or rumors in the local community.\n\nSeek Legal Advice: If there are any disputes or concerns raised by locals or others regarding the property, consult with your lawyer to address these issues legally. They can guide you through the process of resolving disputes, if necessary.\n\nListing the Property: If your legal status regarding the property is clear and there are no disputes, you can proceed with listing the property for sale or seeking a mortgage from a financial institution or lender.\n\nComplete Legal Formalities: Ensure that all legal formalities related to the sale or mortgage, including documentation, title transfers, and any approvals or clearances, are completed as per local laws and regulations.\n\nIt's essential to have all your legal documents in order and address any concerns or disputes proactively to ensure a smooth sale or mortgage transaction. Working with a knowledgeable attorney will be invaluable in navigating the process and addressing any potential issues that may arise.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This is a good defence. However, it cannot be the only defence on which the acquittal can be allowed. You need find more evidence and make the testimony of all the witnesses seem false, authored or unbelievable. The fact that there is no direct evidence to prove your charges, must be used. If you can establish  that there is lack of direct evidence and only substantial evidence, your client can be acquitted for lack of evidence.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Interim bail might be granted initially, with a final decision made after concluding all arguments.\nThank you \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf a case has been registered against you under Section 420 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), which pertains to cheating and dishonestly inducing delivery of property, and you wish to apply for anticipatory bail, here are the steps you should consider:\n\nConsult with an Attorney: It is crucial to seek legal advice from a criminal defense attorney as soon as possible. They will be able to provide you with guidance specific to your case, assess the situation, and help you prepare for the bail application.\n\nGather Relevant Documents: Collect all relevant documents, including the FIR, complaint, and any evidence that can help support your case. Your attorney will need this information to prepare your bail application.\n\nPrepare Your Anticipatory Bail Application: Your attorney will help you draft an anticipatory bail application. In this application, you should include details about the case, reasons why you believe you are entitled to anticipatory bail, and any supporting evidence or arguments.\n\nFile the Application: Your attorney will help you file the anticipatory bail application with the appropriate court, which may be the Sessions Court or the High Court, depending on the severity of the case. It's essential to file the application as soon as possible to prevent your arrest.\n\nNotice to the Prosecutor: Once the application is filed, the court will issue a notice to the public prosecutor to respond to your bail plea.\n\nHearing: A date for the bail hearing will be scheduled. Your attorney will represent you in court during the hearing.\n\nArguments: During the hearing, your attorney will present arguments in support of your anticipatory bail application. These may include reasons why you should be granted bail, such as no likelihood of absconding, cooperating with the investigation, and being willing to appear before the authorities as required.\n\nConditions: The court may grant you anticipatory bail with certain conditions, such as requiring you to cooperate with the investigation, not leaving the jurisdiction, or providing a personal bond or surety.\n\nFollow Court Orders: If the court grants anticipatory bail, it's essential to adhere to the conditions set by the court. Failure to do so can lead to the cancellation of your bail.\n\nMonitoring the Case: Continue to work closely with your attorney to monitor the progress of your case and to ensure you comply with all legal requirements.\n\nAnticipatory bail is not an absolute right, and whether or not it's granted depends on the facts and circumstances of your case. Your defense attorney will play a crucial role in building a strong case for bail. It's important to consult with them promptly to protect your legal rights and interests.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Filing of RCR is a wastage of time. Since you are employed so in salary there must be a component of HRA so as such you are not entitled to maintenance nor residence.

You also have an option to get a divorce thereby on the grounds of irretrievable breakdown to marriage. The petition can be withdrawn by him on the date of his appearance. However, if you get the Court to allow for restitution before he withdraws, then you can save your marriage that you want to save so much.\nHowever, I believe that your marriage has already broken down. You should get a divorce and claim maintenance as well as order or separate residence .You can now file a case of mental cruelty also against him. \nEven working women are entitled to maintenance and separate residence as per many judgments by Supreme Court and highcourts of various states. You have to prove that the husband earns enough money to pay maintenance. The law states that woman should have the same standard of living as she did during the time of marriage. With the help of this, you can atleast get maintenance.\nHope this helps\nThank you\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPlease Contact through Pathlegal Serviceses as your questions are in detail and answers will be given in detail. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Madam,\nYou may immediately take shelter with Police and find out his present employment details and enter into his house forcibly since he has filed RCR.

An alibi is proof that you were present in your office at the time of the alleged incident and so, you can not be the culprit. \nIn many cases, the accused was acquitted because he had a strong alibi and the prosecution did not have any other strong evidence. \nIf you are the plaintiff(prosecution side) asking question, you should try to prove with other strong evidence like his fingerprints on the location of accident, his phone/ring/id/ something that belongs to the accused was found on scene. Some other witness saw him there on the site of the crime etc. \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere was scope to confront witness in cross examination.

That proposal was approved after receiving a go-ahead from the finance department.\nThe eligibility criteria is not applicable to women and children of all castes and religions, members of the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes. As of now there are around 250 advocates associates on the legal aid panel across the Bombay High court and lower judiciary in Mumbai.\n\nIn the high court, an advocate on the panel gets around Rs2,100 as fees and actuals of other expenses.

My father-in-law expired in 2017.\n\nAfter death of husband, MIL was getting normal pension. But the company mistakenly forgot to convert it to family pension and instead paid MIL full pension for 2 extra years. After realizing their mistake, they made up a schedule and started deducting money (50% of the payments) from her pension payments without any notification to MIL. The problem MIL already paid higher income taxes due to the extra payment (to the tune of 1-3L). The company now says it is not their problem and they have to recover the extra amount.\nCan the company really do whatever it wants? MIL suffered losses because of their mistake. Now she has to control her monthly expenses because of their mistake.\n\nOverall we have two concerns\n1. Pension was recovered without any notification to the receiving party. As a result, MIL kept her normal expenses without realizing the company forgot to adjust pension amount and she was spending more than she should.\n2. Shouldn't the company compensate for the losses due to extra income tax paid by MIL? If the company would have notified on time, maybe something could be done. But you cannot amend returns after 1 year. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCompany is within its right to recover extra or excessive payment made to your mother in law.

In this article, we look in detail the process for distribution of property after death of a Hindu male as per the Hindu Succession Act.\nClass 1 Heirs\nThe Hindu Succession Act groups the heirs of a male Hindu into four categories and lays down that his/her inheritable property devolves firstly upon the heirs specified in Class I which are as under:\n•\tSons\n•\tDaughters\n•\tWidow\n•\tMother\n•\tSon of a pre-deceased son\n•\tDaughter of a pre-deceased son\n•\tSon of a pre-deceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a pre-deceased daughter\n•\tWidow of a pre-deceased son\n•\tSon of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son\n•\tDaughter of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son\n•\tWidow of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son\n•\tSon of a predeceased daughter of a predeceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a deceased daughter of a predeceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a predeceased son of a predeceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a predeceased daughter of predeceased son\nAll these heirs inherit simultaneously and to the exclusion of other heirs. In the absence of any of the heirs in this category, the property devolves upon the enumerated heirs specified in class II.\nClass 2 Heirs\nThe devolution in Class II heirs is made in the absence of any heir in Class I and in such a manner that heirs specified in a particular entry share equally. For this purpose if more than one heir is specified in a single entry, they share the property simultaneously and equally to the exclusion of those specified in subsequent entries. Class 2 heirs include:\n•\tFather\n•\tSons daughter’s son\n•\tSons daughter’s daughter\n•\tBrother\n•\tSister\n•\tDaughters son’s son\n•\tDaughters son’s daughter\n•\tDaughters daughter’s son\n•\tDaughters Daughter’s daughter\n•\tBrothers son\n•\tSisters son\n•\tBrothers daughter\n•\tSisters daughter\n•\tFathers father\n•\tFathers mother\n•\tFathers widow\n•\tBrothers widow\n•\tFathers brother\n•\tFathers sister\n•\tMothers father\n•\tMothers mother\n•\tMothers brother\n•\tMothers sister\nAgnates\nIn case a Hindu male passes away intestate and leaves no class 1 or class 2 heirs, then the property would devolve on agnates. A person is said to be an agnate of another if the two are related by blood or adoption wholly through males. Agnate relationship does not extend to relationship by marriage and is restricted to relationship by blood. Also, agnate does not include widows of lineal descendants of the intestate.\nCognates\nIf a Hindu male passes away without a Will and has no class 1 or class 2 heirs or agnates, then the succession would be through cognates. Cognates are ones who are related to the intestate by blood or adoption but not wholly, through males. Thus mother’s brother’s son and brother’s daughters son are cognates, eligible for heirship.\n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

If you have introduced yourselves to others as a married couple etc. \nHope this helps you\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSection 125 can be used only by wife not by a live in partner. But under Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 an aggrieved person means any woman who is or has been in a domestic relationship with respondent and respondent means any male who is or has been in a domestic relationship with aggrieved person.

To address the concerns you've raised, you may consider taking the following steps:\n\nMunicipal Complaints: If your neighbor is engaging in activities that are causing public nuisance or violating municipal bylaws, you can file complaints with your local municipal corporation (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation or BMC in the case of Mumbai). This can include issues like blocking common areas, illegal constructions, and improper disposal of waste. Provide as much evidence as possible, such as photographs and records of incidents.\n\nLegal Action: If your neighbor's actions continue to be disruptive, and you believe they are encroaching on common spaces, you may want to consult with a local lawyer to understand your options for taking legal action. Legal proceedings can be initiated, but the duration of the case can vary significantly depending on the complexity of the matter, the local court's backlog, and other factors.\n\nMediation: Sometimes, it's beneficial to seek mediation or reconciliation with your neighbor to try and resolve the issues amicably. Mediation can be faster and less adversarial than legal action.\n\nPolice Complaints: If there are physical altercations or threats of violence, you should report these incidents to the local police. The police will investigate and, if warranted, take appropriate action.\n\nDocumentation: Keep thorough records of all incidents, complaints, and interactions with your neighbor. This documentation can be valuable if you need to present evidence in a legal case.\n\nConsult a Local Attorney: Consult with a local attorney who specializes in property and housing matters. They can provide guidance specific to your local laws and regulations, helping you understand your rights and options.\n\nRegarding the duration of a legal case, it can vary widely depending on the complexity of the case, the number of parties involved, the evidence presented, and the court's caseload. Legal proceedings in India can sometimes take several years to conclude, but it's essential to consult with a legal professional who can give you a more accurate estimate based on your specific circumstances.\n\nIn the meantime, you should continue to report any illegal activities, nuisances, or encroachments to the relevant authorities and maintain proper documentation of these incidents to support any future legal actions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You can serve legal notices on the family of your deceased husband who is disputing your rights. You can also sue them for your share ( though limited) for your share in the properties in which your deceased husband had a share, your deceased husband's self earned properties (both movables and immovables) if any.You have to obtain an injunction for that purpose to prevent the properties from being sold, transferred etc. \nYou can also file a case against your in-laws  for maintenance.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Section 8 of Hindu Succession  Act: \n====================================================================\nGeneral rules of succession in the case of males.―The property of a male Hindu dying intestate\nshall devolve according to the provisions of this Chapter:―\n(a) firstly, upon the heirs, being the relatives specified in class I of the Schedule;\n\nCLASS I\n\nSon; daughter; widow; mother; son of a pre-deceased son; daughter of a pre-deceased son; son of a pre-deceased daughter; daughter of a pre-deceased daughter; widow of a pre-deceased son; son of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son; daughter of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son; widow of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son.\n\n=============================================================================\nDistribution of Property after Death – Hindu Male\nFor Hindus, testamentary succession (succession by way of Will) is as per the Indian Succession Act and intestate succession (succession without Will) is as per the Hindu Succession Act. In this article, we look in detail the process for distribution of property after death of a Hindu male as per the Hindu Succession Act.\nClass 1 Heirs\nThe Hindu Succession Act groups the heirs of a male Hindu into four categories and lays down that his/her inheritable property devolves firstly upon the heirs specified in Class I which are as under:\n•\tSons\n•\tDaughters\n•\tWidow\n•\tMother\n•\tSon of a pre-deceased son\n•\tDaughter of a pre-deceased son\n•\tSon of a pre-deceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a pre-deceased daughter\n•\tWidow of a pre-deceased son\n•\tSon of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son\n•\tDaughter of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son\n•\tWidow of a pre-deceased son of a pre-deceased son\n•\tSon of a predeceased daughter of a predeceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a deceased daughter of a predeceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a predeceased son of a predeceased daughter\n•\tDaughter of a predeceased daughter of predeceased son\nAll these heirs inherit simultaneously and to the exclusion of other heirs. In the absence of any of the heirs in this category, the property devolves upon the enumerated heirs specified in class II.\nClass 2 Heirs\nThe devolution in Class II heirs is made in the absence of any heir in Class I and in such a manner that heirs specified in a particular entry share equally. For this purpose if more than one heir is specified in a single entry, they share the property simultaneously and equally to the exclusion of those specified in subsequent entries. Class 2 heirs include:\n•\tFather\n•\tSons daughter’s son\n•\tSons daughter’s daughter\n•\tBrother\n•\tSister\n•\tDaughters son’s son\n•\tDaughters son’s daughter\n•\tDaughters daughter’s son\n•\tDaughters Daughter’s daughter\n•\tBrothers son\n•\tSisters son\n•\tBrothers daughter\n•\tSisters daughter\n•\tFathers father\n•\tFathers mother\n•\tFathers widow\n•\tBrothers widow\n•\tFathers brother\n•\tFathers sister\n•\tMothers father\n•\tMothers mother\n•\tMothers brother\n•\tMothers sister\nAgnates\nIn case a Hindu male passes away intestate and leaves no class 1 or class 2 heirs, then the property would devolve on agnates. A person is said to be an agnate of another if the two are related by blood or adoption wholly through males. Agnate relationship does not extend to relationship by marriage and is restricted to relationship by blood. Also, agnate does not include widows of lineal descendants of the intestate.\nCognates\nIf a Hindu male passes away without a Will and has no class 1 or class 2 heirs or agnates, then the succession would be through cognates. Cognates are ones who are related to the intestate by blood or adoption but not wholly, through males. Thus mother’s brother’s son and brother’s daughters son are cognates, eligible for heirship.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDo you have his death certificate with you? If not you may take a certified copy of his death certificate and take out next-of-kin certificate on the basis of the death certificate. Then you may file a claim with the concerned mnc or bank to pay you the entire sum of money. If the mnc or bank doesn't pay you then you may file a suit against the concerned mnc or bank. That note has no legal sanctity. Even if that note is treated as will of your husband, your brother-in-law shall have to apply for probate on the basis of that note within 3 years of your husband's death. But the same is subject to challenge by you. You may get in touch with me for a detailed discussion in your matter.\nRegards,\nBidhayak Acharyya\nAdvocate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Make sure to mention the loss of job as well.\nThank you \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMaintenance is based on the income and expenses of the husband,  besides this, liabilities are also considered to fix maintenance.\nGenerally,it is one third of the income.\nAs you have mentioned that you were earning only 25k, then the judge cannot order you to pay 15k as maintenance, because apart from maintenance to your wife, you have to spend many more on your personal survival and on dependents.\nThe order of the court was fit to be Appealed before the High Court, which you missed.\nNow, as per law, either you pay whole dues or deposit half before the court to file an appeal.\nBut, you cannot avoid payment of maintenance even when you aee jobless. However, you can once try to appeal against the order of the lower court which allowed 15 k as maintenance.\nSince, many specific points are missing which can strengthen your case and you can get relief, therefore, you should consult any Advocate and discuss in detail.\nYou may contact me for professional consultation through call or whatsapp to discuss in detail.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If you are going to take a personal loan for repaying your home-loan EMIs, then you are stepping into a debt trap. You are paying your low-cost home loan while burdening yourself with a high-interest loan. By doing this, you are generating more liabilities for yourself.\nIt is noteworthy to know that there is no tax benefit on the repayment of a personal loan; however, you can get a deduction of up to INR 1.5L per annum towards the repayment of the principal amount under Section 80C. Furthermore, you can also claim a deduction on the interest paid on the EMI for a home loan for up to INR 2L under Section 24.\nSo, paying off home loan with a personal loan does not seem like a good tax-saving option. \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo . claim is only for interest on housing loan .

The ownership and division of property during a divorce can be complex and depend on various factors, including the nature of the property, the applicable personal laws, and the specific circumstances of the case. Here are some general points to consider:\nNature of Property: The nature of the property can significantly impact how it is treated during divorce proceedings. If the property was acquired by your parents and gifted to you, it may be considered your separate property, especially if it was given as a gift to you personally and not to the marital partnership.\nApplicable Laws: The laws that apply to property division during divorce can vary based on factors such as religion and the specific personal laws that govern your marriage. For example, Hindu, Muslim, Christian, and other religious communities in India may have different laws governing marriage and divorce.\nJurisdiction: The jurisdiction where the divorce case is filed can also influence property division. Different states in India may have varying interpretations of property division laws.\nContributions: Courts may consider the financial and non-financial contributions of both spouses during the marriage when deciding on property division. If you made significant contributions to the property in question, it could affect the court's decision.\nHaving a foreign passport should not automatically result in the loss of property, especially if it was acquired as a gift from your parents. However, the outcome of property division during divorce can be influenced by various factors, and legal advice tailored to your situation is essential.\nTo protect your interests and rights, it is strongly recommended that you consult with a family law attorney in India who can provide you with specific legal guidance based on the details of your case and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. They can help you understand your rights, options, and potential outcomes related to property division in the event of a divorce.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHusband being Indian pp holder, law applicable to both of you is Indian law. Under Indian law husband has no rights to property of wife after divorce. So in every case he cannot claim any or your property in India  or abroad after divorce.

The acquisition of agricultural land in India by foreign nationals is subject to various regulations and restrictions imposed by the government. The rules may vary from state to state as land is a state subject in India, and some states have more relaxed regulations, while others have stricter rules.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\nResidential Property: Overseas passport holders are allowed to buy residential and commercial properties in India. There are usually no restrictions on foreign nationals owning residential or commercial real estate.\n\nAgricultural Land: Foreign nationals, including overseas passport holders, are generally not allowed to buy agricultural land in India. In most cases, they can only inherit agricultural land.\nInheritance: If you already own property or land in India and are an overseas passport holder, you can typically inherit that property and retain ownership. You can also transfer it to your children who are also overseas citizens. However, it's essential to comply with the specific rules and regulations of the state where the property is located.\nSpecific Rules: Some states may have specific rules that allow or restrict certain categories of overseas passport holders from owning land or property. Therefore, it's crucial to check the regulations in the particular state where you intend to buy or own property.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAcquisition and transfer of immovable property  by PIO/NRI/FOREING NATIONAL OF Indian ORIGIANS is regulated in terms of Sub-Section (3), (4) and (5) of Section 6 of FEMA read with notification No. FEMA 21/21/2000/RB.

It implies that the court wants both parties to appear and participate in the legal process. Failure to comply with a conditional order to appear may result in adverse consequences, including potential legal repercussions.\nIt's important to take such orders seriously and consult with your attorney immediately to understand the implications and the specific actions you need to take. Your attorney should guide you on the appropriate steps to follow in response to this order. Ignoring or failing to appear as required can lead to unfavorable outcomes in your case.\nRegarding your earlier reliance on your advocate's advice to not appear in court until called, it's essential to have clear communication with your attorney and ensure that you fully understand the legal strategy being employed in your case. Legal strategies can vary, and the decision to appear or not should be made in consultation with your attorney, taking into account the specifics of your situation.\nIn any legal matter, especially one as serious as a criminal case, open and transparent communication with your legal counsel is vital. If you have concerns or questions about the strategy being used in your case, don't hesitate to discuss them with your attorney to ensure you are fully informed about the proceedings and your responsibilities.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir go to the court change the lawyer , and if you are innocent then why drag the matter  submit your alibi .and request the court for the investigation , and try to close the case as soon as possible . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

However, generally speaking, if one co-owner of a property wants to make significant changes to that property, it is often required to obtain the consent or approval of the other co-owners.\nIn your scenario, where one co-owner has constructed a structure on the property without the consent or approval of the other co-owner, it can lead to a legal dispute. The co-owner with the 60% share may have a valid argument that their rights have been infringed upon by the construction of the structure without their approval.\nThe co-owner with the 40% share seeking an injunction from the court is likely attempting to prevent the demolition of the structure until the dispute is resolved. Whether the court grants such an injunction would depend on various factors, including the laws of your jurisdiction, the specific circumstances of the case, and whether the court believes there is a legitimate claim or harm that warrants the injunction.\nIt's important for both co-owners to consult with legal counsel to understand their rights and options in this situation. They may need to go through a legal process to resolve the dispute and determine the appropriate course of action regarding the structure on the property.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This\n\nincludes filling a large cavity, which seems to have resulted from his negligence.

Explain your situation and request the information you need.\n\nSubmit a Written Request: Prepare a formal written request addressed to the concerned authority at the Electricity Board. In your request, clearly state your reasons for requesting the documents and provide any relevant details, such as the connection number or any reference numbers you have.\n\nCheck for Online Portals: Some electricity boards have online portals where consumers can access their connection-related documents. Check if the Tamil Nadu Electricity Board has such a portal and if your documents are available there.\n\nConsult a Legal Professional: If you encounter difficulties in obtaining the documents through the above steps, it may be advisable to consult a legal professional or attorney who specializes in property and administrative matters. They can guide you on the legal steps to take to access these documents.\n\nConsider a Right to Information (RTI) Application: While you mentioned that you prefer an alternative to an RTI appeal, it's worth noting that the Right to Information Act, 2005, provides a mechanism for citizens to request information from public authorities.

Arbitration case is technical in nature and is different from civil cases. In petition under section 9 court cannot decide on the point of limitation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn your situation, it appears that your ex-business partner filed a Section 9 application for interim relief in an arbitration case even though it was filed out of limitation, and the judge has suggested that it's a matter of limitation and fact. Let's break down the key points:\n\nLimitation: Limitation refers to the prescribed period within which a legal action or application must be filed. If a claim is filed beyond the specified limitation period, it can be barred, and the court may dismiss it solely on the ground of being time-barred.\n\nSection 9 Application: Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, allows a party to an arbitration agreement to seek interim measures from the court. These interim measures are intended to preserve the status quo, protect the rights of parties, and ensure that the arbitration process is effective.\n\nJudge's Statement: If the judge has suggested that the matter is a question of limitation and fact, it indicates that the judge believes that both the limitation issue and the factual aspects of the case should be considered. This implies that the judge may not be inclined to dismiss the application solely on the ground of being out of limitation and is open to examining the merits of the case.\n\nIn such a situation, it may be necessary to address both the limitation issue and the merits of the case in your response to the Section 9 application. Here are some steps to consider:\n\nRaise Limitation as a Defense: You can assert the defense of limitation and provide evidence to support your claim that the application was filed beyond the prescribed time limit. This is a valid defense and may result in the application being dismissed if the court finds that it is time-barred.\n\nAddress the Merits: Simultaneously, you should address the factual aspects of the case and argue against the necessity of granting interim relief. Present your arguments and evidence to demonstrate why the interim relief sought is not justified or necessary.\n\nConsult with Legal Counsel: It's crucial to consult with an experienced attorney who specializes in arbitration and dispute resolution. They can assess the specific details of your case, guide you on the best legal strategy, and represent your interests effectively in court.\n\nUltimately, the judge will make a determination based on the facts and applicable law. While limitation is a valid ground for dismissal, if the judge believes that there are substantive issues to be considered, the case may proceed on its merits. Your legal counsel will be able to provide you with tailored advice based on the specifics of your case and jurisdiction.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nSince, the judge has already not considered the grounds of limitation, you will have to find other grounds to challenge the case. You may give reasons as to why no interim relief should be granted. \nIt is necessary for you now to fight from the facts of the case. \nThank you \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear sir,\nSome trial courts not ready to dispose the cases summarily like on the ground of Limitation itself.

It is executed on stamp paper so as not to create any doubt about date of execution of will. You can execute a will in favour your siser. Will can be registered or un-registered. An un-registered will is as valid as registered will.  But if the will is registered, no stamp duty is charged on will, only registration fee has to be paid. But is safer to register will as that will rule out the doubt as to signature of testator/will maker. After drafting of will the testator/will maker has to sign the will in the presence of  two attesters/witnesses to the execution of will, the witness should state/endorse on the will that they saw the will maker signing the will. As no stamp duty is required for registration  of will, you have to pay only lawyer’s fee for drafting will, that will not be more than 20 K in any case. A beneficiary of will cannot be a witness to the execution  of will. A witness has to be a third party. For further clarification you may contact me through Pathlegal.

In your will, you can designate your sister's son (nephew) as the beneficiary of your assets. However, there are some important points to consider:\n\nConsult with a Lawyer: It is highly advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in wills and estate planning to ensure that your will is legally valid and complies with the laws of your jurisdiction. Laws regarding wills and inheritance vary by country and even within regions, so it's essential to have professional guidance.\n\nWitnesses: Most jurisdictions require wills to be signed and witnessed by two or more impartial individuals who are not beneficiaries or closely related to beneficiaries. Make sure your will is properly witnessed to enhance its legal validity.\n\nReview and Update: You can update your will at any time if your circumstances or wishes change. It's a good practice to review and update your will periodically to ensure it reflects your current intentions.\n\nExecutor: Consider appointing an executor in your will. An executor is responsible for carrying out the instructions in your will and distributing your assets as specified.\n\nLegal Formalities: Follow all legal formalities and requirements for creating a valid will in your jurisdiction. This may include the use of specific language and formatting.\n\nCommunication: It's important to communicate your intentions to your family members and beneficiaries, so there is no confusion or dispute after your passing.\n\nKeep the Will Safe: Once your will is properly executed, store it in a safe place, and inform your executor and trusted family members or friends where it can be found.\n\nRemember that the laws and regulations regarding wills and inheritance can be complex, and they can vary significantly from one place to another. Consulting with a lawyer will help ensure that your will is legally sound and that your assets are distributed according to your wishes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nYes, you can make a will now.

    "headline": "Transactions between relatives and non relatives",
    "data": " \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHouse Board had alloted a property to Mr.X, who died later. His 4 sons A,B,C,D paid all the remaining due instalments, but when the time came for registration, the eldest son 'A' didn't come forward for registration. So the remaining 3 sons B,C,D, went ahead with the registration to the extent of their 75% undivided shares, each getting 25%. Housing Board while registering the Sale Deed included a clause, which read, \"until and unless the vendees take NOC from A or get the property partitioned legally through the court, vendees can't alienate the property\".\nNow the fact is, both B & C transferred their shares to D through a registered Gift Deed. At this point of time A's share is still with the Housing Board as an allottee, since he didn't come forward for registration of his 25% share.\nAfter a gap of nearly 5 years, 'A' went ahead with the registration of his 25% share and the Housing Board included a similar clause while registering his share as had been done earlier while registering shares of B,C,D. which read, \"until and unless the vendees take NOC from D or get the property partitioned legally through the court, vendees can't alienate the property\".\nThe real problem when A sold his 25% share to an advocate who filed a frivolous and vexatious suit after unilaterally erecting a structure in his 25% share out of the total undivided plot of 500 sq.yards taking prime front area even though he owns only 25% share.\n\nMy main question, whether I can differentiate the transaction of brothers B & C giving their shares to D, who are blood relatives, and the other transaction between A and the Advocate who are not relatives.\n\nCan D win the case, in this scenario. Pls guide.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhat is sold to Advocate by A is not a determined part of property but unascertained share of 25 per cent in the  property. Advocate has no right  to built any structure of claim any specific part of the  property. Property has to be divided in four equal parts by a commissioner appointed by Court. Each part will be given titles on a piece of like A, B, C and D. after that each vendee will be asked to pick one, the  part picked up by first vendee will be his. In the  like manner all will get their part as per their luck. This is procedure . For further clarification contact me through Pathlegal. Hit like button if answer is useful to you.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nFrom the clause mentioned by you that even A had to take consent of D before alienating the property, you can show that the transfer between a and the Advocate is void. Since, no consent was given by you. \nYou can also get an injunction from the Court, for removing the structure in the front. Your main focus, should be on proving that the sale was void for there was no consent from the co-owner.  \nI do not seem to understand, how you want to differentiate the transactions between relatives and non-relatives. However, if you mean that transfer of shares from  brothers to D is not a transfer as compared to transfer between A and Advocate, your contention is valid. What you can say is that it was only a transfer of rights relating to their share of the property. \nYour chances of winning, definitely exist. But, it depends on how well your lawyer presents your case.\nHope this helps. \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir,\n\nAs per your case facts, Sale transaction is void between A and Advocate, Purchaser have no right to do anything, due to did not comply the clauses mentioned by Housing Board.\n\nApproach the Court for justice. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI can offer some general insights into the situation you've described. For accurate legal advice, you should consult with a qualified attorney who can review all the relevant details and applicable laws in your jurisdiction. That said, here are some points to consider:\n\nClause in Sale Deed:\n\nThe clause in the Sale Deed that restricts alienation without obtaining a No Objection Certificate (NOC) or going through legal partition is significant. Such clauses are legally enforceable and can restrict the ability of a co-owner to sell their share without the consent of the other co-owners.\nTransfer of Shares to D by B and C:\n\nWhen B and C transferred their shares to D through registered Gift Deeds, it's essential to determine whether these transactions violated the clause in the Sale Deed. If these transfers were made without obtaining an NOC from A or without legal partition, they might be in violation of the clause, and A might have legal grounds to challenge these transactions.\nSale of A's Share to the Advocate:\n\nThe sale of A's share to the advocate appears to be a separate transaction. However, the enforceability of the clause in the Sale Deed will depend on the specific language used and the interpretation of the court.\nIf the clause effectively restricts any sale of the property without NOCs or legal partition, the advocate may face challenges in transferring A's share without compliance.\nPartition of Property:\n\nOne possible resolution could be to proceed with the partition of the property legally through the court, as mentioned in the clause. This process would involve the court determining each co-owner's share and facilitating the division of the property accordingly. It can be a complex legal process and may require the involvement of all co-owners.\nLegal Advice and Court Proceedings:\n\nGiven the complexity of the situation, it is crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can assess the specific language in the Sale Deeds, review the Gift Deeds, and provide guidance on the enforceability of the clauses and the potential legal strategies.\nIf the advocate's actions are indeed in violation of the clause and if the court determines that A has a valid claim, it is possible that D may face legal challenges in the case.\nUltimately, the outcome will depend on the specific legal language, the court's interpretation, and the strength of the arguments presented by all parties involved. It is essential to seek legal counsel to navigate this situation effectively and understand your rights and options under the relevant laws and agreements.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Wait for 60 days of mandatory period. Afterwords approach Civil Court expressing your intension of deleting the surname by making all the above said institutions as parties to the proceedings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn India, including Bangalore, changing or removing a surname from academic documents typically involves a legal process, and it cannot be done solely through a notary. Here are the general steps involved in changing or removing a surname from academic documents:\n\nPrepare a Deed Poll or Affidavit: You will need to prepare a legal document known as a Deed Poll or an Affidavit stating your intention to change or remove your surname from your academic records. This document should clearly explain the reasons for the change and provide details about your old and new names.\n\nNotarize the Document: After preparing the Deed Poll or Affidavit, you should have it notarized by a registered notary public. Notarization is essential to authenticate the document.\n\nPublish a Gazette Notification: In some cases, you may be required to publish a Gazette Notification regarding the change of name. This is typically done after notarization.\n\nCourt Process (Optional): While notarization and gazette notification are often sufficient for many practical purposes, if you want to change your name on official academic records, you may need to go through a court process. This involves filing a petition in the appropriate court (usually the jurisdictional Civil Court or District Court) to officially change or remove your surname.\n\nProvide Supporting Documents: Along with the court petition (if applicable), you should attach supporting documents such as your notarized Deed Poll or Affidavit, academic certificates and records, identification documents, and any other relevant documentation that the court may require.\n\nCourt Order (if applicable): If you go through the court process, the court will issue an official order approving the name change or removal of the surname. This court order is essential for changing your name on official records.\n\nNotify Academic Institutions: After obtaining the court order (if applicable), you should notify your academic institutions about the name change or removal of your surname.

Here are some steps you can consider:\nReview the Application: Carefully review the husband's Section 91 CrPC application to understand what documents or information he is seeking and the reasons for the request. This will help you prepare your response.\nPrepare an Affidavit: You may need to prepare an affidavit explaining your position and why the information or documents requested are not relevant to the case. Highlight any potential harm, such as the risk of losing your job, and explain why compliance with the request is not feasible or necessary.\nNegotiation: Explore the possibility of negotiations or mediation between you and your husband to resolve the dispute without involving your workplace. This may be a more amicable way to address the issues.\nSeek Protection Orders: If you genuinely fear for your safety or believe that the request is being made to harass or harm you, you can consider seeking protection orders or restraining orders from the court.\nCompany's Policies: Consult with your company's HR department or legal team to understand their policies regarding responding to legal requests. They may be able to provide guidance or support in handling the situation.\nCourt Hearing: Attend the court hearing regarding the Section 91 CrPC application with your attorney. Present your objections, affidavit, and legal arguments to the court. The court will ultimately decide whether to grant or deny the husband's request.\nRemember that each case is unique, and the outcome may depend on various factors, including the specifics of your situation, applicable laws, and the court's discretion. \nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir/Madam,\nWife can withdraw DV case as it was filed by her seeing the side effects from her employer.

The written statement is a formal document in which the defendant can admit or deny the allegations made by the plaintiff and present their own defenses or counterclaims.\nIf the defendant believes that the plaintiff's cause of action is not genuine and wants to challenge it without going through the entire trial process, they may consider filing an application under Order VII Rule 11 of the Code of Civil Procedure (CPC). This rule allows for the rejection of the plaint (the plaintiff's claims) in certain circumstances. Here are some key points to consider:\nGrounds for Rejection: Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC provides specific grounds on which a plaint can be rejected. These include lack of jurisdiction, the suit is barred by law, the suit is not properly instituted, or the plaintiff's cause of action is not disclosed.\nProcedure: To seek the rejection of the plaint, the defendant would need to file an application under Order VII Rule 11. This application should clearly state the grounds on which the rejection is sought.\nHearing: The court will then consider the application and may provide an opportunity for both parties to present their arguments. The court will make a decision based on the merits of the application.\nEffect: If the court accepts the defendant's application and rejects the plaint, it effectively brings an end to the plaintiff's claims in that particular suit.\nIt's important to note that whether or not a rejection petition will be successful depends on the specific facts and circumstances of the case and how well the defendant can establish that the plaintiff's cause of action is not genuine based on the grounds specified in the CPC.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo written stement is must must mention about rejection plaint or fike both at once\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, Defendant can file an application under Order VII Rule 11 Read with Section 151 of Civil Procedure Code for Rejection of Plaint\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t Dear brother / sister\nyes you it can be done\nfurther it is left to the discretion of the judge to decide the next course of action\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Queriest,\nYes, you can file a Petition under Order VII Rule 11 of C.P.C,1908 on the ground of Cause of Action.\nIt is always advisable to file Order VII Rule 11 petition before filing of Written Statement.\n\nYou can contact me for further details.\n\nKindly hit 'LIKE' button if you are satisfied with the answer.\n\nThanks,\nKavya Pathange,\nAdvocate.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Keep in mind that there may be limitations on when such complaints can be filed, and it's best to consult with your lawyer to determine the appropriate course of action.\nSeek an Autopsy: If you believe that the cause of death was suspicious, you can request an autopsy if one was not performed at the time of your brother's death. This can help determine the exact cause of death and may provide important information.\nLegal Proceedings: If there is sufficient evidence to support your suspicion and the authorities determine that further investigation is warranted, legal proceedings may be initiated.

However, I can provide some general information that might help you understand the situation better.\nGift of Property: In Islam, a person generally has the right to gift their property to anyone, including their children, during their lifetime. This is known as a \"Hibah\" or gift. If the Muslim lady has received a freehold property from her mother and decides to gift it to any of her children, she can do so.\nOmission of Children: If the mother decides to gift the property to some of her children while omitting others, this can be a sensitive matter, and it might have implications for inheritance shares after her passing.\nInheritance Rules: Upon the mother's death, Islamic inheritance rules will apply to distribute her estate among her heirs. These rules are generally based on fixed shares for specific family members, such as sons, daughters, spouses, and others.\nSon's Share: If a son is omitted from the gift during the mother's lifetime and he does not receive a share of the property, he may have a valid claim to his rightful share of the inheritance upon her death, provided he is an eligible heir under Islamic law.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You can argue that the buyer has accepted the return of the consideration and therefore the contract has been rescinded. You can also argue that the buyer is estopped from seeking specific performance of the contract because of their conduct in accepting the return of the consideration without objection.\nNegotiate a settlement with the buyer. You may be able to reach a compromise with the buyer, such as agreeing to sell them the property at a higher price than the original contract price, but still less than the current market value.\nIf you lose the suit and are ordered to sell the property to the buyer, you can file an appeal.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI can provide some general information on how to approach a situation where a buyer files a suit for specific performance of a contract after you've returned the consideration amount. Please consult with a qualified attorney for advice tailored to your specific circumstances and applicable laws in your jurisdiction. Here are some general steps you might consider:\n\nConsult an Attorney: Seek legal counsel immediately upon receiving notice of the buyer's suit. An attorney can assess the details of your case, review any relevant documents, and provide you with advice on how to proceed.\n\nReview the Original Contract: Carefully review the terms of the original contract for the sale of the property. It should outline the rights and obligations of both parties, including any provisions related to price adjustments or contingencies.\n\nDefend Your Position: Your attorney will help you build a defense against the buyer's claim for specific performance. One potential argument might be that the buyer accepted the return of the consideration without objection, which could be seen as a waiver of their right to enforce the contract.\n\nEvidence of Buyer's Acceptance: Gather evidence that the buyer accepted the return of the consideration amount without any objection or reservation. This evidence can include correspondence, emails, or other documentation that demonstrates their acceptance.\n\nNegotiate or Mediate: Depending on the circumstances, you may consider entering into negotiations or mediation with the buyer to resolve the dispute amicably. It may be possible to reach a mutually agreeable solution outside of court.\n\nCourt Proceedings: If negotiations or mediation do not result in a resolution, be prepared to defend your case in court. Your attorney will represent your interests, present evidence, and argue your position before the court.\n\nCounterclaim: Depending on the specifics of your situation and the applicable laws, you may have the option to file a counterclaim against the buyer, seeking damages or other remedies if the court determines that the buyer's claim is without merit.\n\nFollow Legal Procedures: Ensure that you comply with all legal procedures and deadlines throughout the legal process. Failure to do so could adversely affect your case.\n\nSeek Legal Costs: If you successfully defend against the buyer's suit, you may be entitled to seek reimbursement of your legal costs and expenses. Your attorney can advise you on this matter.\n\nRemember that property and contract law can be complex, and the outcome of such cases can vary based on the specific details and laws in your jurisdiction. Consult with a qualified attorney who can provide guidance and representation throughout the legal process.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAfter seven year suit for specific performance is not maintainable being barred by limitation.

Pay attention to any clauses related to disputes, remedies, and the specific performance of the contract.\nDocument the Return of Consideration: Ensure that you have clear documentation of the return of the consideration to the buyer. This may include copies of the canceled checks or bank records showing the payment.\nStatute of Limitations: Check if the statute of limitations for filing a suit for specific performance has expired. In many jurisdictions, there is a limited time frame within which such suits can be filed.\nDefend Your Position: Work with your attorney to build a strong defense against the buyer's claim. Your defense might include arguing that the buyer's delay in filing the suit constitutes a waiver of their right to specific performance, or that the return of consideration effectively terminated the contract.\nNegotiation: In some cases, negotiation and settlement discussions may be possible. You can explore the option of reaching an agreement with the buyer outside of court, such as a financial settlement.\nAttend Court Proceedings: If the case proceeds to court, attend all hearings and proceedings as required. Your attorney will represent your interests and present your defense.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The court will consider this evidence when making its decision.\n\nLegal Representation: Ensure that you have legal representation throughout the legal process. An attorney can help you build a strong case, present your evidence effectively, and advocate for your rights.\n\nCharges: The charges you mentioned, such as 417 (cheating), 420 (fraud), and 376 (rape), carry different legal elements and potential penalties. The court will assess whether the evidence and legal arguments support these charges.\n\nConsent: In cases involving sexual offenses, consent is a critical factor. It will be important to establish whether you provided consent or not during the sexual encounters in question. Consent can impact the nature of the charges and the court's decision.\n\nLegal Process: The legal process can be lengthy, involving multiple stages, including investigation, trial, and potentially appeals. The court will evaluate the evidence and legal arguments at each stage.\n\nPossible Outcomes: The possible outcomes of the case can vary. If the court finds the accused guilty, they may face penalties, including imprisonment and fines. However, whether or not the accused will be compelled to marry you as a result of the legal proceedings is a separate matter. The court typically addresses legal issues, not personal or marital matters.\n\nIt's important to consult with your legal counsel to understand the specific details of your case, your legal rights, and the potential outcomes. Legal cases can be complex, and the legal process varies by jurisdiction, so seeking the guidance of a qualified attorney is essential to navigate the situation effectively. Additionally, consider reaching out to local support services or organizations that can provide assistance and resources for individuals in similar situations.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe very fact that u were in a relationship promises are made and broken and sexually exploiting should have been objected and if he's given in a written message that hel marry at a certain time day year a written commitment then you can file a complaint against him regarding the same with proofsetc as cheating case\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSurely he will get the punishment after the trial in the court when you have all the evidence, you just produce all before the court and prove it .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

They can provide you with legal advice specific to your situation, assess the merits of your case, and guide you through the legal process.\n\nGrounds for the Writ Petition: Clearly identify the grounds on which you are challenging the order made under Rule 26(9).

This petition should include details of the order you are challenging, the reasons for challenging it, the legal arguments supporting your case, and any relevant supporting documents.\n\nFile the Petition: Submit the writ petition to the high court. Ensure that you follow the court's procedures for filing and pay any required filing fees. Your attorney can assist you with this process.\n\nServe Notice: After filing the petition, you will need to serve notice to the concerned authorities or parties who issued the order under Rule 26(9). They will have an opportunity to respond to your petition.\n\nHearing: The high court will schedule a hearing for your case. During the hearing, both parties will present their arguments before the court.\n\nCourt's Decision: The high court will review the merits of your case, consider the legal arguments presented by both sides, and make a decision. The court may issue a writ directing the authorities to take a specific action or may quash the order, depending on the circumstances.\n\nAppeal, if Necessary: If you are not satisfied with the high court's decision, you may have the option to appeal to a higher court, such as the Supreme Court of your country, depending on the legal system in your jurisdiction.\n\nIt's crucial to note that the specific procedure and requirements for filing a writ petition may vary depending on your jurisdiction and the laws applicable to your case. Therefore, consulting with an attorney who is familiar with the legal processes in your jurisdiction is essential to ensure that you take the correct steps and meet all necessary requirements when filing a writ petition.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The decision to quash the FIR is at the discretion of the High Court. Generally, quashing is considered in cases where there is no prima facie evidence to support the allegations and the case appears to be filed maliciously or with ulterior motives. Your chances of success would depend on the specific facts of your case and the arguments presented to the court. Consulting with an experienced criminal defense lawyer is crucial to assess the merit of your case.\nTravel Abroad: If your bail conditions restrict your travel abroad and require court permission, you should consult with your lawyer regarding seeking such permission. The court will consider various factors, including the seriousness of the charges, your ties to India, and the reason for travel, before granting or denying permission.\nDomestic Violence Case (DVC): For matters related to the Domestic Violence Act, you should consult with your legal counsel. Depending on the circumstances and orders of the court in the DVC case, it may be possible to attend court proceedings remotely or seek permission to travel.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

Such agreements are generally notarized for added formality and can help clarify various aspects of the relationship to prevent misunderstandings in the future. \nContent of the Agreement: The agreement should cover various aspects of your live-in relationship, such as:\nFinancial arrangements, including property and asset sharing.\nResponsibilities and obligations of each partner.\nDuration of the live-in relationship agreement (whether it's indefinite or for a specific period).\nDecision-making processes.\nDispute resolution mechanisms.\nAny provisions related to children (if applicable).\nTermination or dissolution of the live-in relationship.\nDraft the Agreement: Based on the discussion with your lawyer, draft the live-in relationship agreement. Be clear and specific about each point to avoid ambiguity.\nReview by Both Partners: Both partners should carefully review the agreement to ensure they fully understand and agree to its terms. It's essential that both parties are willing participants in creating this agreement.\nNotarization: While notarization is not mandatory, it adds a layer of formality to the agreement. Visit a local notary public or a sub-registrar's office to get the agreement notarized. Both partners should sign the agreement in the presence of the notary.\nWitnesses: You may also consider having a couple of witnesses present when you sign the agreement. Their signatures and contact details can be included in the document.\nKeep Copies: Make multiple copies of the notarized agreement, and ensure that both partners retain signed copies in a safe place. You may also consider sharing a copy with a trusted friend or family member.\nPeriodic Review: It's a good practice to revisit the agreement periodically, especially if there are significant changes in your relationship or life circumstances. You can amend the agreement as needed, and any changes should also be notarized.\nRemember that while a live-in relationship agreement can provide clarity and structure to your relationship, it may not be legally enforceable in all aspects, as live-in relationships are not legally recognized as marriages in India. However, it can still serve as evidence of your mutual intentions and expectations in case of any disputes or legal issues in the future. \nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir,\nIt may be termed as MoU (Memorandum of Understanding) and you may get it done through any Family Court Advocate by mentioning relevant terms and conditions but it is not legally bind since it is a arrangement between you adult couple. \n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

In many cases, neighboring property owners do not have automatic rights over your land. However, there are some important points to consider:\nProperty Boundaries: It's crucial to have a clear understanding of the boundaries of your land. This information is typically documented in your property's title deed and Record of Rights, Tenancy, and Crops (RTC). The RTC in your name suggests ownership.\nEasements: Sometimes, neighboring properties have legal easements or rights of way that allow them limited access to your land for specific purposes, such as maintenance of utilities or access to their own property. These rights are usually documented.\nLocal Laws: Local land use and property laws can vary, and in some cases, there might be specific regulations or agreements that grant limited rights to neighboring property owners.\nEncroachments: If there are any structures or activities on your land that encroach upon neighboring properties or violate local regulations, this could lead to disputes or legal issues.\nProperty Transactions: While you generally have the right to sell or lease your land to anyone, it's essential to follow the legal procedures and ensure that the buyer or lessee has a clear understanding of property boundaries and any existing easements.\nDispute Resolution: If there are disputes with neighboring property owners regarding land rights or boundaries, it's advisable to seek legal counsel and, if necessary, engage in dispute resolution processes, such as mediation or legal action.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir,\nYes, you are the absolute owner and in legal possession and reflected your name in the RTC.

Advocates or lawyers who draft these documents are generally not required to maintain their own registration. Instead, they are expected to ensure that the documents they draft are properly registered with the relevant government authority, which is usually the Sub-Registrar of Assurances in the concerned jurisdiction.\nHere are the key points related to the registration of documents by lawyers:\nDrafting of Documents: Advocates and lawyers often draft various legal documents, including property-related deeds like sale deeds, rent deeds, and transfer deeds, as part of their legal services to clients.\nRegistration Process: After drafting, these documents must be presented for registration at the local Sub-Registrar's office. The Registration Act, 1908, prescribes the procedures and requirements for registration.\nMaintaining Records: While lawyers themselves are not required to maintain a separate registration, they should maintain records of the documents they have drafted, along with any corresponding client details, to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards.\nStamp Duty: Lawyers should also ensure that the appropriate stamp duty is paid on the documents as per the Stamp Act applicable in their state. Stamp duty is a prerequisite for registration.\nExecution and Attestation: Advocates may also play a role in the execution and attestation of these documents, ensuring that they are signed by the parties in the presence of witnesses, if necessary.\nIt's important to note that while lawyers are involved in the drafting and execution of these documents, the actual registration is carried out by government authorities. Failure to register important documents can result in legal issues and may render the documents invalid.\nTherefore, it's crucial for individuals engaging in property transactions or any dealings involving legal documents to seek the services of qualified advocates who are knowledgeable about the relevant laws and procedures governing document registration in their specific jurisdiction.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo, such provision mandating document drafter advocate to maintain such register. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDrafting ki book aati h use le skte ho barna judgement daily read kro drafting me improvement aa jayega\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If the judge has dismissed your application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC, it means that, in the judge's view, the plaintiff's application under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act is not liable to be rejected at this stage based on the grounds you raised, such as being out of limitation.\nHere are some potential steps you can consider:\nReview the Order: Carefully review the order passed by the judge to understand the specific reasons for the rejection of your application under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC. Understanding the judge's rationale can help you determine your next steps.\nConsult a Lawyer: It's advisable to consult with an experienced attorney who specializes in arbitration and civil litigation. They can provide legal advice tailored to your specific case, review the order, and assess the strengths and weaknesses of your position.\nAppeal: Depending on the legal system in your jurisdiction, you may have the option to appeal the judge's order. An appeal allows a higher court to review the lower court's decision. Your attorney can advise you on the feasibility of an appeal and guide you through the process.\nAmendment of Pleading: In some cases, if the judge's decision is based on a defect in your application or pleading, you may be allowed to amend your pleading or application to address the deficiencies identified by the court. Your attorney can advise you on whether this is a viable option.\nAlternative Dispute Resolution: Since the matter appears to be related to arbitration (Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act), consider whether alternative dispute resolution methods, such as negotiation or mediation, may be more suitable to resolve the dispute with your ex-business partner.\nCompliance with Court Orders: Ensure that you comply with any further orders or directions issued by the court in the ongoing proceedings.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nthe sec 9 of the arbitration is out of the purview of the CPC\nso you file your objections in the counter and prove it is not maintainable and to be dismissed\ndont go against the order passed and it is waste of money, energy, health and peace\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn case of Arbitration, proceeding shall be governed by Arbitration and conciliation Act.

    "headline": "Plaintiff is not in possession, can she seek interim injunction",
    "data": " \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRespected Sirs,\n\nMy mother is a joint owner of a property. The original owner of that property is my mother's father who had died in 1998. After his death, my mother, her elder brother and her mother became the joint owners. My mother's elder brother and her mother were trying to hand over the entire property to a promoter and for which my mother gave strong objection. As a result, one day they forcefully ousted my mother from that property by way of tortures and my mother started residing in a rented house and she is still there. My mother came to know that they sold out their two shares to a third party on 18.01.2023 by making a map/site plan indicating my mother's portion and third party's portion in that property which is absolutely illegal and wrong because no partion took place between my mother and them prior to making such sale by court of law or by mutual consent so my mother has filed a Suit for declaration of that sale deed as Null and Void and not binding upon her. Yesterday, such Suit was duly admitted. My mother will move her interim injunction application tomorrow because third party is now trying to take physical possession of the property and also trying demolish the same. \n\nMy mother filed a Writ Petition before the Calcutta High Court prior to filing of that Suit for declaration and in that Writ Petition on 14.09.2023 The Hon'ble Justice of Calcutta High Court has directed the Local Police Station to provide adequate police protection to my mother and me so that we can return to my mother's father's property and the entire process will be videographed by the police. The order copy was communicated to the Local Police Station on 15.09.2023 for immediate compliance.\n\nSo, now my question is that can my mother get interim injunction against the third party tomorrow because some Lawyers saying that your mother is not in possession of the property so such injuction will not be allowed. Some other Lawyers saying Yes, your mother will get such injunction because, title, share, right and everything belongs to your mother, so, your mother may not be in possession of the property due to some disputes but to protect such rights she can get interim injunction. \n\nSo, I am very confused at this time what law says in this regard because interim injunction will be moved tomorrow should we tell everything to the Court in a fair manner or should we supress one thing by saying that my mother is in the possession of the property. \nWe are very concerned about the grant of such interim injunction.\n\nPls suggest me.\n\nThanks and Regards.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nInjunctions are legal remedies issued by a court to prevent a party from taking certain actions. In this case, your mother wants to obtain an interim injunction to prevent the third party from taking possession or demolishing the property.\nThe grant of an interim injunction typically depends on several factors, including the merits of the case, the balance of convenience, and whether irreparable harm would be caused to your mother if the injunction is not granted. Whether or not your mother is in physical possession of the property may affect the court's decision, but it may not be the only determining factor.\nHere are some considerations:\nTitle and Rights: If your mother can establish that she has a valid title and rights to the property, the court may be more inclined to grant an injunction, even if she is not in physical possession. The court may consider the legal rights and interests associated with the property.\nBalance of Convenience: The court will weigh the potential harm to your mother against the harm that the third party might suffer if the injunction is granted. If the court believes that your mother's rights and interests are more substantial, it may grant the injunction.\nMerits of the Case: The court may also consider the merits of your mother's case, including the validity of the sale deed and whether it was legally executed. If there are significant legal issues in her favor, it could influence the court's decision.\nFair and Full Disclosure: It's generally advisable to provide the court with all relevant information and not to suppress any facts. Courts often appreciate full and honest disclosure. Misrepresentation of facts can have serious legal consequences.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tShe will get order don't worry file petition not to alinate create further rights in property and take stay also\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The RTI Act allows citizens to request information from government authorities, including details about the status and progress of their applications or petitions.\nHere's how you can proceed:\nDraft an RTI Application: Prepare a formal RTI application addressed to the Public Information Officer (PIO) of the labor court where you filed your petition. In your application, clearly state that you are seeking information regarding the non-registration of your petition and the reasons for the delay.\nProvide Specific Details: Include specific details in your application, such as the date when you filed the petition, the petition number (if assigned), and any communication you had with court officers regarding the delay in registration.\nRequest Timely Response: Request that the PIO provide a timely response and clarify the reasons for the delay in registering your petition.\nAttach Required Fee: In many cases, you will need to attach the prescribed fee for filing an RTI application. The fee amount may vary by jurisdiction, so check with the relevant labor court or government website for the exact fee and payment instructions.\nSubmit the Application: Submit the RTI application to the labor court's designated PIO. Ensure that you keep a copy of the application and any acknowledgment or receipt issued by the court.\nFollow Up: After submitting the application, periodically check for responses from the PIO. They are generally required to respond within a specified time frame, which can vary by jurisdiction.\nReview the Response: Once you receive a response, review the information provided by the PIO. If you are not satisfied with the response or if your petition remains unregistered, you may consider further legal or administrative remedies, such as approaching higher authorities or seeking legal counsel.\nUsing the RTI Act can be an effective way to seek information and transparency regarding the status of your petition. It can help you understand the reasons behind the delay and, if necessary, take appropriate action to address the issue.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNow a days petitions are checked and if there is no defect then the same are registered and are given case number.

However, it's essential to ensure that your request is clear and well-documented. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to proceed:\nPrepare a Formal Application: Draft a formal application addressed to the appropriate authority, such as the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) or the State Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission, explaining the situation. Clearly state that the State Forum order is not applicable because the matter is still pending before the District Forum.\nInclude Necessary Details: In the application, provide all the essential details, including your case number, the date of the District Forum's order, the specific points of illegality and jurisdictional issues you are contesting, and the date when the matter is scheduled for final hearing.\nRequest for Acceptance: Request in the application that your revision petition be accepted without the State Forum order as it is not relevant to the pending matter.\nAffidavit: Attach an affidavit to your application affirming the accuracy and completeness of the information provided in your request.\nScan and Upload: Scan the signed application and affidavit, and then upload them to the e-filing portal under point 4, clearly marking it as the \"Application Explaining Inapplicability of State Forum Order.\"\nConfirmation and Follow-Up: After submitting the application, keep a record of the submission, including any reference numbers or acknowledgments provided by the e-filing portal. You may also consider sending a physical copy of the application by registered mail to ensure that it reaches the appropriate authority.\nMonitor the Status: Regularly check the status of your revision petition on the e-filing portal. If there are any further requirements or if your request to exclude the State Forum order is not accepted, you may need to follow up accordingly.\nBy providing a clear and formal application along with an affidavit, you are taking the necessary steps to explain the situation to the authorities and request the appropriate action. While it's not uncommon for online filing systems to have mandatory fields, authorities often understand that certain situations may warrant exceptions, as in your case. Your explanation and request should help ensure that your revision petition proceeds without unnecessary complications related to the State Forum order.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear\nClient for discussion about Your case in detail you can contact me on my mobile number.\nThanks \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnless case is not disposed by district commission till then no revision petition is pending in state commission.

Access to your property is a fundamental right, and being landlocked without legal access can significantly affect the usability and value of your land. Here are some steps you can consider taking to address this situation:\nReview Property Documents: Gather all relevant property documents, including the sale deed, property survey, and any agreements or records related to access rights. These documents will be essential for your attorney to assess the situation.\nNegotiation: Initially, you may want to attempt to negotiate with the neighboring property owner who has blocked your access. In some cases, a negotiated solution, such as purchasing a right of way or easement, may be possible. Your attorney can help facilitate these negotiations.\nPrescriptive Easement: Depending on the laws in your jurisdiction, you may explore the concept of a prescriptive easement. A prescriptive easement is a legal right to use someone else's property acquired through continuous, open, and uninterrupted use for a specified period. Your attorney can determine if this is a viable option in your case.\nLegal Action: If negotiations and other alternatives do not yield results, you may need to consider legal action to assert your right to access your property. This could involve filing a lawsuit to establish your right of way, request the court to order the neighboring property owner to provide access, or seek compensation for the lack of access.\nLand Records and Local Authorities: Check with your local land records office or municipal authorities to see if there are any records of access rights or public rights of way that may have been overlooked. Local authorities may have information or regulations that could be relevant to your situation.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir file petition for the path way under easement act at the DJ court.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMove to civil court for mandatory  and permanent  injunction \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t I can provide you with some general information that might be helpful. In a situation where your plot is landlocked, meaning it has no legal access to a public road, there may be legal remedies available. You should consult with a qualified attorney in your jurisdiction who can provide specific advice tailored to your case. Here are some possible options to consider:\n\nNegotiate with the Neighbor: You can try to negotiate with the owner of the neighboring property to grant you a legal right of way or an easement to access your land. This agreement would need to be legally documented to ensure it is enforceable.\n\nPrescriptive Easement: In some jurisdictions, if you can demonstrate that you or your predecessors have used a particular path across the neighbor's land for a long period (typically many years, depending on local laws), you may be able to claim a prescriptive easement, which would grant you a legal right to access your property through that path.\n\nLegal Action: If negotiations and other amicable approaches fail, you may need to resort to legal action. You could file a lawsuit to assert your right to access your land. The court may order an easement or right of way in your favor if it deems it necessary to ensure you can access your land.\n\nGovernment Involvement: In some cases, local government authorities may be able to help resolve access issues. They may have legal mechanisms in place to ensure that landlocked properties are provided with access.\n\nLand Swap or Purchase: You could explore the possibility of buying a narrow strip of land from a neighboring property owner to establish a legal access route to your land.\n\nQuiet Title Action: In some cases, you might consider a quiet title action to clarify and establish your ownership rights to the land, including access rights.\n\nIt's crucial to consult with an attorney who specializes in real estate and property law in your jurisdiction. They can assess the specifics of your case, review any relevant deeds and documents, and provide guidance on the best course of action. Property laws and regulations vary by location, so it's important to get advice that is tailored to your situation and the legal framework in your area.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Here are some considerations:\nThird Schedule Contents: The Third Schedule appears to outline the allocation and rights related to common areas and restricted common areas within the building. It designates certain areas and facilities as common or restricted to specific occupants or owners of different floors.\nValidity of Indenture: The validity of the indenture itself would depend on whether it was executed in accordance with applicable laws and whether all parties involved, including the builder and the members/buyers, consented to its terms. The legality of the document, including any restrictions or allocations it outlines, would be subject to review by legal experts and possibly a court if a dispute arises.\nBMC Recordation: If the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) has not taken the indenture on record, it may raise questions about its enforceability or the rights it conveys. Proper recording with the relevant authorities is often essential to ensure the document's legal standing.\nRights of Occupants: The Third Schedule appears to grant certain exclusive rights to the occupants of specific floors, including the use of common areas. Whether these rights are legally binding and enforceable would depend on local property laws and whether they are consistent with other legal provisions.\nImpact on Transfer to Society: The implications of the Third Schedule on the transfer of the Land and Building to the society would need to be evaluated in the context of the society's bylaws, applicable property laws, and any other relevant agreements. It may affect the allocation of common areas and rights among the society members.\nLegal Consultation: Given the complexity of property transactions and rights allocation, it is strongly recommended that you consult with a qualified real estate lawyer who is familiar with local property laws and regulations. They can review the specific details of the indenture, assess its validity, and provide guidance on how it may impact the transfer of the property to the society and the rights of individual members.\nResolution and Disputes: If there are disputes or uncertainties regarding the Third Schedule and its impact, legal recourse may be necessary. An attorney can help you navigate the legal process and protect your interests.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t I can provide some general information that might help you understand the situation you've described. To get accurate legal advice on this matter, it's essential to consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate and property law in your jurisdiction. Here are some general insights based on the information you provided:\n\nImplications of the Third Schedule: The Third Schedule you've mentioned appears to outline the allocation of common areas and restricted common areas within the building. These allocations are often made to specify which parts of the building are for the exclusive use of certain unit owners or occupants. The implications of this schedule depend on the terms and conditions mentioned in the indenture of assignment and how it has been legally incorporated into the property agreements and documents.\n\nValidity of the Indenture: Whether the indenture is valid in law depends on various factors, including the laws and regulations governing property transactions in your jurisdiction. To determine the validity of the indenture, a legal expert would need to review the specific terms and conditions, how it was executed, and whether it complies with local property laws.\n\nTransfer of Land and Building to Society: If the indenture of assignment was executed by the builder and included in the sale agreements of the members/buyers of the 7th to 12th floors, it may indicate that certain portions of the land and building were allocated for the exclusive use of those specific unit owners. However, the transfer of the entire property, including common areas, to a housing society would typically involve a separate legal process, such as the formation of the society and the execution of appropriate legal documents.\n\nBMC Non-Recording: The fact that the BMC (Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation) has not recorded the indenture may have implications for its legal validity or enforceability. It's important to investigate the reasons behind the BMC's decision and whether any further action is required to ensure the indenture's legal standing.\n\nIn summary, the implications and validity of the Third Schedule and the indenture of assignment will depend on the specific terms and conditions outlined in these documents and how they align with local property laws and regulations. To address these concerns effectively and determine the way forward, you should consult with a qualified attorney who can review all relevant documents and provide legal guidance tailored to your situation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

However XEROX copy is available. How to get the certified copy of original page? Is it possible to restamped to the old GPA backdated? \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nHowever, it's important to note that altering or backdating legal documents like a GPA, especially without proper authorization, can have serious legal consequences and may be illegal.\nHere are some general steps to consider when trying to obtain a certified copy of an original GPA:\nContact the Adjudicating Authority: Start by reaching out to the adjudicating authority in Bangalore where the GPA was adjudicated in 2019. Explain your situation and inquire about the process for obtaining a certified copy of the original stamped page. They may have records or procedures in place for such requests.\nProvide Proof of Ownership: Be prepared to provide proof that you are the rightful owner or beneficiary of the GPA. You may need to demonstrate your legitimate interest in the document.\nFile an Application: If the adjudicating authority confirms that they can provide a certified copy, you may need to file a formal application. This application should include details of the original GPA, such as the date, parties involved, and any reference numbers.\nPay Fees: There may be fees associated with obtaining a certified copy. Ensure you pay any required fees promptly.\nRequest a Duplicate Stamp: If the original stamped page is missing, inquire about the possibility of obtaining a duplicate stamp from the authority. They may have a process for reissuing stamps in case of loss.\nNotary or Gazetted Officer: Once you have the certified copy or duplicate stamp, you can take it to a notary public or a gazetted officer to attest to its authenticity if required. This can add an extra layer of verification.\nRegarding your question about restamping an old GPA backdated, it's essential to emphasize that altering the date on a legal document to make it appear as if it was executed on a different date than it actually was can be illegal and may constitute fraud or forgery. Such actions can have serious legal consequences.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tnot possible . if  the party is available make another GPA\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir go to the area sub registrar bangalore where the GPA is registered . there only apply for the certified document in person . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir,\nYou may get another GPA saying that earlier GPA is in continuation of later GPA due to above technical reason. \n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

This can often be a quicker and less expensive way to resolve disputes compared to going to court.\n\nSmall Claims Court: If all else fails, you may have to consider taking legal action in small claims court, assuming the amount owed falls within the jurisdictional limits of such courts. You may represent yourself in small claims court without an attorney.\n\nConsult with a Debt Collection Agency: In some cases, hiring a debt collection agency could be an option. They can often apply additional pressure on the debtor to pay. However, be cautious when choosing an agency, as some practices may not be legal.\n\nSeek Financial Assistance: While pursuing legal action, consider seeking financial assistance from local charities, government programs, or nonprofit organizations that offer support to individuals facing financial crises.\n\nRemember, it's crucial to consult with a legal professional to understand the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction and to get advice tailored to your situation. They can guide you on the best course of action based on the particulars of your case.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

I can provide a general overview of the typical steps involved in such situations:\nNotice for Unauthorized Construction: When the local authorities become aware of unauthorized construction, they usually issue a notice to the property owner. This notice informs the owner about the violation and directs them to stop construction or demolish the unauthorized portion.\nDemolition Notice: If the property owner fails to comply with the initial notice, the municipal corporation may issue a demolition notice. This notice specifies a deadline by which the owner must demolish the unauthorized portion of the building. It also warns that if the owner does not comply, the authorities will undertake the demolition, and the owner will be responsible for the associated costs.\nDe-occupation Notice: In some cases, authorities may issue a de-occupation notice, requiring the occupants to vacate the unauthorized structure for safety reasons.\nLock and Seal: In situations where the unauthorized construction poses an immediate danger to the occupants or the public, the authorities may choose to lock and seal the building temporarily until the issue is resolved.\nSelf-Demolition: Property owners are generally encouraged to voluntarily demolish the unauthorized portion or building within the specified timeline to avoid further legal action and demolition costs.\nMunicipal Demolition: If the property owner does not comply with the demolition notice or de-occupation notice, and the unauthorized construction poses a safety hazard or violates local zoning laws, the municipal corporation may proceed with the demolition on its own. The costs of demolition are typically billed to the property owner and can result in legal penalties.\nLegal Action: In addition to demolition, the municipal authorities may take legal action against the property owner for violating building regulations. This can include fines, legal proceedings, or other penalties.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCorporation will demolish and claim the charges from the owner of the building\n\nregards\n\nRJ Associates\nTrivandrum\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nyes if the order/notice is not complied then the corporation will demolish the building\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir file the protest petition . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn cases of unauthorized construction, local municipal corporations generally have the authority to take action, including demolition, especially after issuing notices like lock and seal, deoccupation, and demolition notices.

Here's a general overview of the process:\nFirst Motion:\nBoth spouses (petitioners) jointly file the divorce petition, along with the mutual consent affidavit, before the family court.\nThe first motion is primarily the filing of the divorce petition and the mutual consent affidavit. It's typically done together on the same day.\nDuring the first motion, you are not required to appear before the court together; instead, the petition and affidavits are submitted to the court through your respective lawyers.\nThe court may give a date for the first motion to be recorded.\nCooling-Off Period:\nAfter the first motion is recorded, there is a mandatory six-month cooling-off period.\nDuring this period, the court may suggest reconciliation measures or counseling, although it's not always required.\nSecond Motion:\nAfter the cooling-off period (usually six months from the date of filing the petition), the second motion is scheduled.\nBoth spouses are required to appear before the court together for the second motion.\nDuring the second motion, the court will verify if the parties continue to be in mutual agreement for divorce.\nIf both parties reconfirm their mutual consent to divorce, the court may grant the divorce decree.\nRegarding the financial settlement, it's common for parties to discuss and agree on the financial aspects, including any settlement amount, division of assets, or alimony, before or during the divorce proceedings. The timing of such payments can be negotiated and included in the divorce settlement agreement.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

The eligibility for OCI cards is primarily based on the Indian origin of the applicant or their ancestors.\nHere are some key points to consider:\nEligibility: OCI cards are typically available to foreign nationals who can prove their Indian origin. This includes individuals who were citizens of India on or after January 26, 1950, or who were eligible to become citizens of India at that time. It also extends to their descendants.\nIndian Origin: In your case, since you were born and brought up in India and later obtained an overseas passport with an OCI card, your grandchild may be eligible for an OCI card based on your Indian origin. However, eligibility criteria may vary, and it's essential to review the latest guidelines provided by the Indian government, particularly the Ministry of Home Affairs, to confirm the specific requirements and application process.\nDocumentation: To apply for an OCI card for your grandchild, you may need to provide documentation that establishes the lineage and connection to you as the OCI cardholder. This documentation may include birth certificates, marriage certificates, and any other relevant records.\nApplication Process: The application process for an OCI card typically involves submitting an application form, supporting documents, and the required fees to the designated authorities, such as the Indian Embassy or Consulate in your country of residence.\nLegal Changes: Please note that immigration and citizenship laws can change over time. It's crucial to refer to the latest information and guidelines provided by the Indian government, specifically the Bureau of Immigration and the Ministry of Home Affairs, to ensure that you meet all the requirements for your grandchild's OCI card application.\nProfessional Advice: Given the specific nature of your case, it's advisable to consult with the Indian Embassy, Consulate, or a legal professional who specializes in immigration and OCI matters. They can provide guidance tailored to your situation and help ensure a smooth application process.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t No ,he has to apply according to his status as citizen of foreign country which will depend on his birth   Your citizenship is of no relevance to his status as citizen or OCI . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tthey need to contact the tehsil of the area you did reside  .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Here is a general outline of the process you can follow in West Bengal:\nAffidavit: The first step is to create an affidavit for name change. You can do this by visiting a local notary or magistrate office. In the affidavit, you should mention your old name, new name, and the reason for the name change. Make sure to keep multiple copies of the affidavit.\nNewspaper Publication: After getting the affidavit, you need to publish a notice about your name change in at least two local newspapers. One of these newspapers should be in the language of the area where you reside. This publication is essential for making the name change public.\nGazette Publication: To change your name officially, you need to publish it in the Official Gazette of the Government of India. In West Bengal, you can apply for this publication through the West Bengal Government Gazette. You will need to submit an application along with the necessary documents and fees. The process may take some time, and you should follow up on the status of your application.\nGovernment Notification: Once your name change is published in the Gazette, it is considered official. You can use the Gazette notification as legal proof of your name change.\nUpdating Educational Records: To change your name on your educational certificates, you will need to contact the educational boards or institutions where you studied. This typically involves submitting an application along with the Gazette notification and other supporting documents. Each educational institution may have its own process for name change requests, so it's essential to check with them individually.\nAdmit Cards and Marksheets: After changing your name on educational certificates, you can apply for changes in admit cards and marksheets. You may need to provide the updated certificates as proof of your name change.\nDocumentation: Keep copies of all the documents related to your name change, including the affidavit, newspaper publications, Gazette notification, and correspondence with educational institutions.\nLegal Advice: If you encounter any difficulties during the process or have specific questions related to your case, it's advisable to seek legal advice or consult with a lawyer who specializes in name change matters.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir file petition for the same at the DJ court then with that order contact all the department for the same in person. as only department can change the name , in person . but not in admit card , no . they have no role in any thing . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If your employment contract stipulates a notice period of three months and includes a clause stating that the notice period buyout depends on the project manager's decision, you may need to follow the terms of the contract.\nIf you choose to resign after serving only one month's notice, your employer may take certain legal actions, which could include:\nBreach of Contract: Your employer may claim that you are breaching the employment contract by not serving the full notice period as agreed upon. They could potentially seek damages for any losses incurred due to your early departure.\nWithholding Salary or Benefits: Your employer may withhold a portion of your salary or other benefits as compensation for not serving the full notice period, as specified in the contract.\nLegal Action: In some cases, employers may decide to take legal action to enforce the terms of the employment contract, particularly if they believe your departure has a significant negative impact on their business.\nIt's crucial to review your employment contract thoroughly and seek legal advice if you have concerns about your obligations and potential consequences for resigning before the agreed notice period. Additionally, consider discussing your situation with your HR department or a legal professional to explore possible alternatives, such as negotiating with your employer for a shorter notice period or an amicable exit agreement.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou are bound to serve notice period in terms of service contract and if there is provision to buy only then you can buy notice period.

The legal provisions may vary, so it's essential to understand the rules and regulations applicable to cooperative housing societies in your area.\nGenerally, redevelopment involves demolishing an existing building and constructing a new one in its place. This process usually requires the consent of the society members and adherence to local development and building regulations.\nPrecautionary Measures:\nEnsure that you have all the legal documents related to the garage, including the family settlement deed and registration documents. These documents will establish your ownership of the garage.\nParticipate actively in the cooperative society's decision-making process regarding redevelopment. Attend meetings and stay informed about the proposed redevelopment plans.\nSeek legal advice from a property lawyer to review any agreements or documents related to the redevelopment project. They can advise you on your rights and obligations as a garage owner in the cooperative society.\nCommunicate openly with the society and the builder to understand their plans, timelines, and any compensation or alternative arrangements they offer regarding your garage.\nLegal Protection for Garage Owners:\nThe legal protections available to garage owners during redevelopment depend on the laws and regulations in your jurisdiction.\nIn some cases, cooperative society members, including garage owners, may have a say in the redevelopment project's terms and conditions, including compensation or alternative accommodation.\nThe law typically requires that garage owners be adequately compensated or provided with an alternative parking space if their garages are affected by the redevelopment.\nLitigation and Court Support:\nIf disputes arise during the redevelopment process, including issues related to compensation or alternative arrangements, garage owners have the option to seek legal remedies.\nCourts can provide relief to garage owners if their rights are infringed upon or if the redevelopment process violates the law.\nThe outcome of any legal proceedings will depend on the specific facts of the case, the applicable laws, and the arguments presented by both parties.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.You as member need not agree .

However, for precise legal advice, consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in real estate and cooperative housing matters, as the specific laws and regulations can vary depending on your jurisdiction.\n\nLegal Aspects of Garage Ownership in Redevelopment:\n\nIn redevelopment projects involving cooperative housing societies, garages or parking spaces are typically considered part of the common areas. When a building is redeveloped, the cooperative society and the developer must address the allocation of these common areas, including garages. Here are some considerations:\n\nConsent of Garage Owners: It's important to determine whether the garage owners, like yourself, have consented to the redevelopment plan. Often, redevelopment agreements require the consent of a certain percentage of members, which may include garage owners, for the project to proceed.\n\nCompensation or Alternate Arrangements: Redevelopment agreements may specify compensation or alternative parking arrangements for garage owners whose spaces will be affected by the redevelopment.\n\nLegal Status: Ensure that your ownership of the garage is legally recognized and documented. You mentioned registering the transfer through a family settlement, which is a good step. Verify that your ownership rights are clear and that you have the necessary documentation to prove it.\n\nLegal Recourse and Court Support:\n\nWhether the court will support a garage owner in a redevelopment dispute depends on various factors, including the specific terms of the redevelopment agreement, local laws, and the circumstances of the case. In general:\n\nRights of Garage Owners: If you have legal ownership of the garage and your rights are protected under the law, you may have a basis for asserting your interests in the redevelopment process.\n\nEnforcement of Agreements: Courts typically enforce agreements between parties, so if there is a valid redevelopment agreement in place, the terms of that agreement will be important.\n\nNegotiation and Mediation: Before resorting to court, parties involved in a dispute often attempt negotiation or mediation to find a mutually acceptable solution. This can be faster and less costly than litigation.\n\nLegal Representation: If you find yourself in a dispute with the builder and the cooperative society, it's crucial to have legal representation. An attorney with expertise in real estate and cooperative housing matters can assess the specifics of your case and advise you on the best course of action.\n\nIt's essential to review all relevant documents, including the redevelopment agreement, cooperative society bylaws, and any agreements related to your garage ownership. Additionally, consult with an attorney who can provide tailored advice and guide you through the legal processes that may be necessary in your situation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It's important to consult with a qualified attorney who can provide advice tailored to the specific circumstances and relevant laws in your jurisdiction. Here are some points that might be considered:\nAppeal Process: Since the pensioner has already filed an appeal in the High Court, the outcome of the appeal will be crucial. If the conviction is overturned or if there are substantial legal errors in the lower court's judgment, it could impact the pension withdrawal decision.\nSection 13(1)(d) PC Act: If the pensioner's conviction under Section 20 of the Prevention of Corruption Act (PC Act) is found to be inapplicable for Section 13(1)(d), this argument should be presented and substantiated in the appeal process. Legal counsel can help raise this issue effectively.\nCriminal Procedure: The failure to follow proper criminal procedure, such as not calling for the defense under Section 233 of the CrPC, may be a ground for appeal and can potentially impact the pension withdrawal decision.\nGazette Notification: If it can be demonstrated that the relevant Anti-Corruption Bureau (ACB) was not officially declared as a police station through a Gazette notification, this may also be raised as a legal issue.\nRTI Information: The information obtained through RTI (Right to Information) regarding the witness not leaving his place of work on the day of the alleged incident may be used to challenge the credibility of the case against the pensioner.\nFabricated Case: If there is evidence to support the claim that the case against the pensioner was fabricated by the complainant and the ACB, this should be presented as a defense.\nLegal Representation: It is essential for the pensioner to be represented by a competent and experienced attorney who can effectively present these legal arguments and evidence in the appeal process and any subsequent proceedings related to pension withdrawal.\nGovernment Rules: Review the specific government rules and regulations governing pension withdrawal in your jurisdiction to understand the grounds on which pensions can be withdrawn and any available legal remedies.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAll these reasons can result in acquittal . and pension is saved . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst you may have to immediately challenege the notice issued by the government by way of special civil application before high court and further pension rules in somewhat way differ among the class of employees.

Here are some points to consider:\nBar Council Regulations: State Bar Councils typically have regulations and disciplinary procedures in place to address complaints against advocates. They have the authority to investigate complaints and take disciplinary actions if necessary.\nEvidence: The outcome of your complaint may depend on the evidence you provide to support your claims. It's essential to document your case thoroughly, including any communication, agreements, or transactions with your advocate.\nComplaint Process: The State Bar Council will follow a formal complaint process, which may include an investigation, a hearing, and a decision. The process can take time, and the outcome will depend on the findings.\nAdvocate's Response: Your advocate will have the opportunity to respond to the complaint and present their side of the story. The Bar Council will consider both sides before making a decision.\nLegal Lobbying: While concerns about networks or lobbying can exist, it's essential to follow the proper legal channels and procedures. Bar Councils are independent bodies tasked with regulating the legal profession, and they are expected to act impartially.\nLegal Advice: Consult with another attorney who can provide guidance on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction and the likelihood of your complaint leading to action against your former advocate.\nPatience: The process can be lengthy, so it's important to be patient and cooperate with the State Bar Council during their investigation.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes fike civil consumer criminal case u will win\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, it is a professional misconduct of your advocate. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir kindly do not discuss the matter with friends as they are not lawyer . they can misguide . sir the no one is above the law . if they do not take any action you are free to file case at the DJ court and the honorable high court . yes we can expect action . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

They can assess the specific facts of your case and advise you on whether your situation could be considered a legally recognized marriage or not.\nMediation: If both parties are willing, consider seeking mediation to discuss your separation and any potential issues, such as property division, child custody, or support. Mediation can help you reach mutually acceptable agreements without resorting to lengthy legal battles.\nRestraining Orders: If your wife resorts to threats or harassment, consult with your attorney about the possibility of obtaining a restraining order or protective order to ensure your safety and well-being.\nConsultation with Legal Professionals: You should consult with a family law attorney as soon as possible to understand your rights, obligations, and legal options. It's essential to have legal representation to protect your interests, especially if your wife proceeds with any legal actions.\nEvidence: If you believe you were never legally married, gather any evidence that supports your position, such as documentation, witnesses, or any other relevant information.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon’t worry if you are not legally married with her.. not question of Divorce ..other cases she can file but not divorce .click for further assistance \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir do you want to live with that lady or not . if no , then you go for the FIR . why to wait for that lady to go for the FIR . the temple should be arya samaj only and the temple too gives receipt of the wedding ,mandatory . be strong . sir check as if the photo is morphed or what , as making photo is very easy in today scenario.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

However, the specific circumstances under which an SLP can be filed, especially after other legal remedies have been exhausted, can vary based on the facts of the case and the applicable laws. Here's a general overview:\nCivil Appeal: A civil appeal is a common legal remedy to challenge a decision of a lower court or tribunal, including the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC). If a civil appeal has already been filed and decided, and a review petition has also been dismissed, it means that the usual appellate remedies have been exhausted.\nCurative Petition: A curative petition is a rare and exceptional remedy available in India. It is typically used when a petitioner believes that there has been a gross miscarriage of justice, and it is the last resort for redressal after all other remedies, including appeals and reviews, have been exhausted.\nSpecial Leave Petition (SLP): An SLP is a discretionary remedy that allows the Supreme Court of India to grant special permission to hear an appeal against any judgment, decree, determination, sentence, or order in any cause or matter. It is not an appeal by right but is granted at the discretion of the Supreme Court.\nIn your scenario, if the curative petition arising out of a civil appeal and a review petition has been dismissed by the Supreme Court, it suggests that the petitioner has already exhausted most available remedies.\nHowever, the possibility of filing an SLP after the dismissal of a curative petition would depend on the specific facts of the case, whether there are any exceptional circumstances, and whether the Supreme Court is inclined to grant special leave. The Supreme Court has the authority to entertain an SLP if it believes that the case raises substantial questions of law or issues of public importance.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\ncurative petition is being filed after exhausting the SLP provision\nso you cant come again and file  for the SLP \nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThere are other remedies available to you.

Whether an SLP is permissible after a Curative Petition is dismissed depends on the specific circumstances and the legal principles governing these petitions. Here's a general explanation:\n\nCurative Petition: A Curative Petition is a legal remedy available in India after a review petition is dismissed by a higher court. It is intended to correct gross miscarriages of justice and is a relatively limited remedy. The Supreme Court has laid down specific guidelines for when a Curative Petition can be filed and under what circumstances.\n\nSpecial Leave Petition (SLP): An SLP is generally filed in the Supreme Court to seek permission to appeal a lower court's decision. The Supreme Court has wide discretion in granting or denying permission to file an SLP. It is not a matter of right.\n\nMultiple Petitions: In some cases, parties may try different legal remedies sequentially. For example, if a Curative Petition is dismissed, they may subsequently file an SLP.\n\nProcedural and Jurisdictional Aspects: The procedural and jurisdictional aspects of whether an SLP is permissible after the dismissal of a Curative Petition in a specific case may depend on various factors, including the specific issues raised, the legal arguments presented, and the precedents set by the Supreme Court in similar cases.\n\nExceptional Circumstances: Generally, the Supreme Court tends to consider SLPs sparingly and in exceptional circumstances. It may consider issues of public importance, substantial questions of law, or significant injustices. Whether your case meets these criteria is something that an experienced legal professional can assess.\n\nConsult an Attorney: To determine whether it is permissible to file an SLP after the dismissal of a Curative Petition in your specific case, you should consult with an experienced attorney who can evaluate the details of your case and provide guidance based on the current legal framework and precedents.\n\nThe ability to file an SLP after a Curative Petition and the chances of it being admitted by the Supreme Court can vary depending on the facts and circumstances of each case. Therefore, it's crucial to seek legal advice from a qualified attorney who can provide guidance tailored to your specific situation.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenerate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

However, some general principles can be applied:\nReinstatement of Pension: In many legal systems, when a person is acquitted on appeal and their conviction is overturned, their pension is typically reinstated. This means that they should receive their pension from the date of acquittal onwards.\nArrears Payment: In cases where the pension was wrongfully withheld during the period of conviction, the individual may be entitled to arrears for the period of withdrawal. This would be the amount they would have received as pension during that time.\nMinimum Pension: The existence and amount of a minimum pension, if any, would depend on the specific pension scheme or government regulations. Some pension schemes may have provisions for a minimum pension amount that must be paid regardless of the circumstances.\nLegal Remedies: If the government or pension authority refuses to reinstate the pension or pay arrears despite the acquittal, the affected individual may need to pursue legal remedies, such as filing a claim or petition, to enforce their rights to the pension.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nonce he is acquitted his pension will be restored and he is entitled to get the arrears of pension\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Request a specific date by which they will make the payment. Communicate with them in writing (email or text message) so you have a record of your conversations.\n\nCheck Your Employment Contract: Review your employment contract to ensure that the payment you are owed is clearly defined and agreed upon. This will help you understand your rights and the terms of payment.\n\nSend a Legal Notice: If your employer continues to delay or refuses to pay, consider sending a legal notice through a lawyer. A legal notice typically outlines the amount owed, the legal consequences of non-payment, and a deadline for payment.\n\nConsult a Labor Attorney: Seek advice from a labor attorney who specializes in employment and wage-related issues. They can provide guidance on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction and help you take appropriate legal action.\n\nFile a Complaint: Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the option to file a complaint with a labor department or a relevant government agency that handles labor disputes. They can investigate and facilitate the resolution of wage-related issues.\n\nSmall Claims Court: If the amount owed falls within the jurisdictional limit, you may consider filing a case in small claims court. Small claims court allows individuals to represent themselves and seek compensation for debts and damages.\n\nDocument Everything: Keep records of all communications, bounced cheque details, promises made, and any other evidence related to the unpaid wages. This documentation will be valuable if you need to pursue legal action.\n\nBe Patient: Legal processes can take time, so be prepared for potential delays in resolving the issue. Continue to follow up with your employer and maintain open lines of communication.\n\nSeek Financial Assistance: While pursuing the unpaid wages, explore options for financial assistance to help you during this period of financial hardship. This may include loans, assistance programs, or support from family and friends.\n\nRemember that labor laws and regulations can vary by location, so it's essential to consult with a labor attorney who can provide guidance specific to your situation and jurisdiction. They can help you determine the best course of action to recover the unpaid wages you are owed.\n\n\n\n\n\nRegenerate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The Act defines the rules and requirements for property developers and societies when creating and registering apartment ownership.\n\nWhile there may not be a specific mention of a minimum number of tenements or units required to register an apartment declaration in the MOFA, certain conditions need to be met:\n\nMinimum Area: Usually, each apartment in a building must have a separate and exclusive area for it to be eligible for registration under MOFA. The Act does not specify a minimum size, but each unit should be a self-contained dwelling.\n\nCommon Areas: The Act also deals with common areas and facilities in the building, such as passages, staircases, and other amenities. It's important to define and allocate these common areas and facilities in the apartment declaration.\n\nFormation of a Cooperative Housing Society: In many cases, the formation of a cooperative housing society is required to register the apartment declaration. The society can consist of all the apartment owners, and they collectively manage the common areas and facilities.\n\nDeveloper's Obligations: Property developers are generally responsible for drafting the apartment declaration and providing all the necessary documents to the society or apartment owners for registration.\n\nWhile there may not be a specific minimum number of tenements mentioned in the law, the key is to ensure that the property complies with the provisions of the MOFA and that the apartment declaration clearly defines the rights and responsibilities of each apartment owner and the management of common areas.\n\nPlease note that laws and regulations can change over time, and it's important to consult with a legal professional or the local housing authority for the most up-to-date information and guidance on registering apartment declarations in Maharashtra.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The fact that you have been paying taxes since 2014 is also helpful.\n2) Registration of land in your father's name would be great advantage to prove that you are the rightful owner.\n3) This can constitute an offense of Fraud Sec 420 IPC.\n4)  In Fraud cases, c=the police can arrest the accused even without an arrest warrant.\n5) Settling is a good option. Try this first. IF he does not agree you can always take recourse to courts.\n6) More than injunction, get Declaration of Title as to you being the true owner of the land. So, then nobody can say again that this property was sold to them. \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

While I can provide some general information, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney who specializes in property law in your specific area for advice tailored to your situation. Here are some general points to consider:\n\nAdverse Possession Laws: Some jurisdictions have laws related to adverse possession, which may allow a person to claim legal ownership of land if they have possessed it openly, continuously, and without challenge for a specified period (which can range from several years to several decades). However, the requirements for adverse possession can vary widely, and it's essential to consult with an attorney to determine if this applies to your situation.\n\nLand Records and Documentation: Gather all available documents related to the property, such as old land deeds, surveys, tax records, and any other documents that may establish your family's historical connection to the land.\n\nWitness Statements: If possible, obtain statements from witnesses who can attest to the fact that your family has been in possession of the land for many decades. These statements can support your claim of continuous possession.\n\nConsult an Attorney: Consult with a local attorney who specializes in property and land disputes. They can review the specifics of your case, assess the applicable laws, and guide you on the best course of action.\n\nPrescription Laws: In some jurisdictions, there are laws related to prescription rights, which may allow you to establish certain rights over the land due to long-term possession. Again, the requirements can vary, so legal advice is essential.\n\nLand Records Updates: Some jurisdictions allow for the updating of land records to reflect the current possession. An attorney can help you with the process of updating land records if it is possible in your area.\n\nLand Survey: Consider having a professional land survey conducted to precisely determine the boundaries and extent of the land you possess.\n\nDispute Resolution: Be prepared for potential disputes or legal challenges from other claimants or parties who may have an interest in the land. Your attorney can help you navigate these challenges.\n\nRemember that property laws can be complex and subject to change, and they vary by location. Consulting with a knowledgeable attorney who is familiar with the property laws in your specific jurisdiction is crucial to understanding your options and pursuing a course of action that is legally sound and appropriate for your situation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nYou can a Declaration of Title Order from a Court. As per the rule of adverse possession,  If you have peacefully possessed a piece of land for atleast 20 years then you can be the owner of such land. Since, you say 4-5 decades it means 40-50 years, get all the evidence to prove peaceful possession and you  can be the owner. The evidence could include testimony by neighbours, tax payment slips, no previous cases on that property etc. \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The Andhra Pradesh High Court entertained the writ petition and ordered the respondent to consider the objections of the petitioner and communicate its reasoned decision to the petitioner. As no measures were taken under Section 13(4) by the respondent bank, no directions in this regard are issued till the bank passes appropriate orders on the objections of the petitioner under Section 13(2) of SARFAESI Act.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

My mother who is not educated signed on the partition deed without being aware of the consequences and did not get anything in her name. I was a minor and did not have knowledge about the situation. Now as far as we are concerned we don't have a legal case in 2023 since supreme court has put 31st December 2004 as the cutoff date to challenge partition deeds with respect to woman's rights on property inheritance. My mother herself did not know about what she signed on until 10 years ago. Once we were aware we were not in a position financially to take my uncles to court who were the primary culprits in defrauding my mother. \n\nNow in 2023 my grandfather who was also not aware of the full extent of what he signed on in 2004 is no longer with us. What are my rights as a grandchild? Can I still challenge the partition deed after 19 years? I have contacted few lawyers who have given different answers without clearly answering how the case will affect us with respect to statute of limitations of 12 years and supreme court amendment of 2005. I want to take my uncles to court but there will be no point if the case can be dismissed for the reasons stated above. \n\nPlease give your valuable opinions.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nThe limitation period to challenge a partition is 12 years.\nGrandchildren have to receive from their parents' share only. They do not have a separate share of their own. So, you cannot initiate proceedings in your own name. However, you can do that in your mother's name. You  can a file a case challenging the deed being a fraud since your mother is uneducated she did not understand the contents of the deed ( If the opposite side is able to prove that your mother was aware, then your case will be lost). \nThe 12 year limitation period is from the date of adverse claim to the petitioner. Adverse claim means when the claimant possesses a property interest in the financial asset and such right of the claimant is violated at the hands of other people by holding, transferring, or dealing with the financial asset. Citing that your mother was uneducated and that you also learnt about it only now ( saying 2 3 years ago might prove disadvantageous), you cn very well explain the cause of delay. \nThe decision of whether there is unreasonable delay or not will be of the Court itself.\nHope this helps.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes they have rights . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir,\nWhat does the grandparent's property law in India state? Does the grandson own the right to the property?\nAll property's owned by a Hindu person devolves onto his class one legal heir's. \n\nNow to the specific scenario's in ur example (for sake of convenience I'm presuming your grandfather has only one legal heir)\n\nSenario1: The property is self acquired by your Grandfather, in such case upon his demise intestate (without a will) the property would devolve upon ur Father and not you. In case your father passes away before your grandfather then in such case it would devolve upon you, your mother and ur siblings equally.\n\nScenario 2: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather father ( ur great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.\n\nScenario 3: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather grand father ( ur great great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.\n\nScenario 4: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfathers great grand father ( ur great great great grand farther) - then in such a case you would be entitled to the property by birth as it becomes ur ancestral property.\n\nTo give you more clarity on the concept of Ancestral Property's : any property which passes undivided down 4 generations of male lineage is called ancestral property. The right to such property acquires at birth unlike other laws of inheritance where right arises upon the death of the the owner.\n\nHope this brings some clarity to your question and your sense of entitlements.\nMeaning of ancestral property  in India-An ancestral property means a propertywhich is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father's fatheror father's fathers' father. ... That means when a coparcener acquires his share inancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it.\nMeaning of ancestral property in India-An ancestral property means a property which is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father’s father or father’s fathers’ father. It passes to the next three generations.\nMeaning of will-A will means a document in which a person specifies the method to be applied in management and distribution of properties after his death.\nThe basic principle involved is that the property should be four generations old. The right to use and acquire property is accrued by persons through birth itself. The division of property is per stripes i.e. that share of one generation is calculated first than the share of successive generations is subdivided according to share of their predecessor. These basic elements are for governing majorly the Hindus.\nIf A inherits property, whether movable or immovable, from his father or father’s father, or father’s father’sfather, it is ancestral property as regards his male issue. If A has no son, son’s son, or son’s son’s son in existence at the time when he inherits the property, he holds the property as absolute owner thereof, and he can deal with it as he pleases . A person inheriting property from his three immediate paternal ancestors holds it, and must hold it, in coparcenary with his sons, sons’ sons and sons’ sons’ sons but as regards other relations he holds it and is entitled to hold it, as his absolute property.”[1]\nNow answer to the question is that that will to ancestral property is not entirelyillegal. That means when a coparcener acquires his share in ancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it. However will shall be executed after the death of the testator and if the coparcener before acquiring a share makes a will than that will be illegal. Share in ancestral property will be inherited by coparceners. So he can make a will to his share in ancestral property.As whatever he acquires is his share now and he can dispose his assets according to his wishes.\nSurender Kumar vs Dhani Ram CS (OS) No.1737/2012 decided on 18th January, 2016 Hon’ble Mr. J. Valmiki Mehta of Delhi High Court ruled-\nIf a person dies after passing of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and there is no HUF existing at the time of the death of such a person, inheritance of an immovable property of such a person by his successors-in-interest is no doubt inheritance of an ‘ancestral’ property but the inheritance is as a self acquired property in the hands of the successor and not as an HUF property although the successor(s) indeed inherits ‘ancestral’ property i.e. a property belonging to his paternal ancestor.\n\n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

Here are the general steps involved in such a case:\nFiling of Perjury Petition:\nYou, as the petitioner, file a perjury petition before the court where the alleged false evidence was given.\nThe petition should detail the specific instances of false evidence provided by the witness and should be supported by relevant documents and evidence.\nNotice to the Accused Witness:\nOnce the perjury petition is filed, the court will issue notice to the accused witness, informing them of the perjury allegations and asking them to respond.\nResponse by Accused Witness:\nThe accused witness will have the opportunity to file a response or counter-affidavit, defending themselves against the perjury allegations.\nEvidence Stage:\nIf necessary, both parties (petitioner and accused witness) will be allowed to present evidence to support their respective positions. This may include documents, affidavits, or other evidence.\nCross-Examination:\nBoth parties may have the opportunity to cross-examine each other's witnesses during the evidence stage. Cross-examination is a critical phase to establish the credibility of the evidence and the statements made by the accused witness.\nArguments:\nAfter the evidence stage and cross-examination, both parties will have the opportunity to present their arguments before the court. This involves explaining their positions and presenting legal reasoning.\nJudgment:\nThe court will consider the evidence, arguments, and counter-arguments presented by both parties.\nThe court will then deliver its judgment, either finding the accused witness guilty of perjury or dismissing the perjury petition if it is not proven.\nPenalty:\nIf the court finds the accused witness guilty of perjury, they may impose a penalty or punishment as provided under the law. Penalties may include imprisonment or fines.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFiling a perjury petition against a witness in a civil case is a legal process that typically involves several stages. The exact procedures can vary depending on your jurisdiction, so it's essential to consult with your attorney who can provide guidance specific to your case. However, here are the general steps involved:\n\nFiling the Perjury Petition:\n\nYou (the petitioner) file a perjury petition against the witness (the respondent) who you believe has provided false testimony or evidence in your civil case.\nYour petition should clearly state the instances of perjury, including the specific statements or evidence that you believe to be false.\nNotice to the Respondent:\n\nAfter filing the petition, the court typically issues a notice to the respondent, informing them of the perjury allegations and providing them with an opportunity to respond.\nRespondent's Reply:\n\nThe respondent has the opportunity to file a reply or counter-affidavit in response to your perjury petition. They may deny the allegations and present their defense.\nEvidence Stage:\n\nOnce both parties have filed their respective pleadings (the perjury petition and the respondent's reply), the court may schedule an evidence stage.\nDuring this stage, both parties may present evidence to support their respective positions. This can include documents, affidavits, witness statements, and any other relevant evidence.\nCross-Examination:\n\nIf there are witnesses involved, including the respondent, both parties may have the opportunity to cross-examine each other's witnesses.\nCross-examination involves asking questions to challenge the credibility and reliability of the witness's testimony.\nArguments:\n\nAfter the evidence stage and cross-examination, both parties may have the opportunity to present their arguments before the court.\nYou and the respondent will have the chance to explain your positions, cite legal precedents, and provide legal arguments supporting your case.\nFinal Judgment:\n\nAfter considering the evidence, arguments, and legal points presented by both parties, the court will make a final judgment regarding the perjury allegations.\nThe court may dismiss the perjury petition if it determines that perjury was not committed, or it may find the witness guilty of perjury if the evidence supports such a finding.\nPenalties for perjury can vary but may include fines, imprisonment, or other sanctions, depending on your jurisdiction's laws.\nIt's crucial to work closely with your attorney throughout this process to ensure that your perjury petition is properly prepared and presented to the court. Additionally, your attorney can guide you through the various stages and help you build a strong case to support your allegations of perjury.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The possession certificate must be obtained from the local authority where the property is located. The possession certificate is valid for one year from the date of issue. \nYou can easily apply for your Land Possession Certificate from the Tahsildar Office (in rural areas) or Revenue Divisional Officer (for urban areas). \nAll you must do is follow the below-mentioned steps: \nStep 1: Visit the concerned Tahsildar Office (if your property is in a rural area) or Revenue Divisional Office (if your property is in an urban area) and obtain the form to get your Land Possession Certificate. Step 2: Fill out your personal details and the details of your property in the form. \nStep 3: Submit the form along with the requisite documents- income certificate, passport-size photos, Ration Card, Aadhaar Card, proof of ownership or property, etc. to the concerned officer. \nStep 4: Once you have submitted the form and the required documents, you will get an acknowledgement along with an application number. You can track your application status using this application number. \nStep 5: A technical officer will visit your property for inspection. The property will further be reviewed by the higher officials and the city planner. Once the review is complete, you can easily collect your possession certificate from the concerned office or you can also download it from the official e-district portal.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Maharashtra, obtaining a possession certificate for your land or property can be a useful step in documenting your ownership and possession of the property. While it may not directly address issues of neighbor encroachment or property document corrections, having a possession certificate can serve as supporting evidence in potential legal disputes. Here are the steps to get a possession certificate in Maharashtra:\n\nVisit the Local Revenue Office: You should visit the local revenue office (Tahsildar's office) in the area where your property is located. This is where you can apply for a possession certificate.\n\nApplication Form: Inquire at the revenue office about the specific application form required for a possession certificate. You will need to fill out this form, providing details about the property, its location, your ownership, and your possession of the property.\n\nSupporting Documents: You may be asked to submit supporting documents along with your application. These documents can include property tax receipts, electricity bills, water bills, or any other documents that demonstrate your possession of the property.\n\nVerification and Inspection: After submitting your application, a revenue officer may conduct a verification and inspection of the property to confirm your possession.\n\nPublication of Notice: In some cases, a notice may be published in a local newspaper to invite objections from the public. If there are no objections within a specified period, the possession certificate may be issued.\n\nPossession Certificate Issuance: Once the verification and any necessary procedures are completed, and there are no objections or disputes, the revenue authorities may issue a possession certificate.\n\nRegistration: The possession certificate should be registered in your name with the local authorities. This ensures that it is officially recorded and can be used as a legal document.\n\nRegarding whether obtaining a possession certificate is worth it for avoiding neighbor encroachment, it is a step that can help strengthen your claim to the property. However, it may not be the only step necessary. To address neighbor encroachment and property document corrections, you should consider the following:\n\nProperty Boundary Survey: Have a professional land survey conducted to determine the exact boundaries of your property and to identify any encroachments by neighbors.\n\nConsult Legal Counsel: Consult with a property attorney who specializes in land disputes. They can advise you on the best legal actions to take, such as sending a legal notice to the encroaching neighbor, initiating boundary disputes, or seeking injunctions.\n\nDocument Corrections: If there are errors or discrepancies in your property documents, work on getting those corrected through the appropriate legal channels.\n\nProperty Disputes Act: In cases of property disputes, you may also consider utilizing the provisions of the Maharashtra Land Revenue Code and the Maharashtra Land Revenue (Dispute Resolution and Settlement of Rights) Act, 1996.\n\nWhile obtaining a possession certificate is a step in the right direction, it's essential to address neighbor encroachments and property document corrections comprehensively and legally with the guidance of a qualified attorney who understands the intricacies of property law in Maharashtra.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This suggests that no immediate legal action was taken against you, and the incident was not treated as a serious offense.\nDamage to the Cars: Since you mentioned that there was no damage to the cars involved, it's less likely that the incident will result in a significant legal issue. If there had been damage to either vehicle, it might have led to insurance claims or civil disputes.\nDocumentation: Keep records of the incident, including any photos taken by the police officer, your account of what happened, and any statements made by the other party and the police officer. This documentation could be useful in case any legal issues arise later.\nFollow-Up with the Police: If you're concerned about the incident resurfacing, you can consider visiting the police station and inquiring about the status of the case. They can provide you with information on whether any formal complaint was filed or if there are any pending legal action.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Visit the SEBI website and follow their instructions for filing a complaint.\nComplain to the Investor Grievance Cell: Many brokerage firms have an investor grievance cell. You can try reaching out to this department within Achievers Equities and file a formal complaint about the issue.\nConsumer Forum/Consumer Court: If the above steps do not lead to a resolution, you can consider approaching a consumer forum or consumer court in your jurisdiction. They deal with consumer complaints, including disputes related to financial services.\nArbitration: Check your agreement with Achievers Equities to see if it includes an arbitration clause. If it does, you may need to go through the arbitration process as per the terms of your agreement.\nLegal Counsel: If all else fails, consider consulting with a legal professional who specializes in financial disputes. They can provide you with legal advice and assist you in taking the matter to court if necessary.\nRemember to gather all relevant documents, including your agreement with Achievers Equities, records of payments made, correspondence with them, and any other evidence that can support your case.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can file complaint to the SEBI\nBut without detail discussion proper consult is not possible.\nSo , you can call me for detail discussion.\nD Bhowmik Advocate, kolkata\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It defines which areas are considered common, accessible to all, and which areas are restricted for specific purposes or individuals.\nYour concern appears to be that the builder has made false statements in a lower court regarding the transfer of land and building to a society, while you argue that certain portions of the property mentioned in the THIRD SCHEDULE, such as land, staircases, and lobbies, have been sold illegally to members of the 7th to 12th floors who are related to the builder. You believe that the Bombay Municipality (BMC) has not accepted this indenture due to these discrepancies, and you allege that the builder has committed perjury by making false statements in court.\nIn this context, the term \"perjury\" typically refers to the act of deliberately providing false information or lying while under oath during legal proceedings.\nTo address your concerns and allegations, it is crucial to consult with a qualified attorney who can review the specific details of your case, the applicable laws, and the evidence you have presented. Your attorney can advise you on the appropriate legal actions to take, including whether to pursue a perjury claim or other remedies based on the discrepancies in the indenture and the builder's statements in court.\nPlease keep in mind that legal matters can be complex, and professional legal advice is essential for addressing your specific situation effectively.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe THIRD SCHEDULE you have provided appears to be a part of the indenture of assignment submitted by the builder, Mr. Kishor Chheda, to the Bombay municipality for the transfer of land and building to the society. Based on the information you've provided, the THIRD SCHEDULE appears to define and categorize certain areas within the property as \"COMMON AREA\" and \"RESTRICTED COMMON AREA.\" Here's a breakdown of its meaning:\n\nCOMMON AREA:\n\nThe COMMON AREA typically refers to spaces within a multi-unit building that are considered common property or shared spaces for the benefit of all residents or owners within the building. It includes areas that are not part of individual units but are for collective use.\nIn this case, the THIRD SCHEDULE lists the following areas as COMMON AREA:\nEntrance with lobby on stilt/ground floor.\nStaircases with landings from stilt to ground floor up to the 11th floor.\nLobbies of stilt/ground floors onwards up to 6th floors.\nCompound open to the sky, excluding the open parking place.\nRESTRICTED COMMON AREA:\n\nRESTRICTED COMMON AREA refers to spaces within the property that are considered common but have certain restrictions on their use. These restrictions typically apply to specific groups of residents or owners.\nIn this case, the THIRD SCHEDULE lists various areas as RESTRICTED COMMON AREA, and it specifies who has exclusive rights to use these areas:\nStaircases from stilt/ground floor towards the basement would be exclusively used by owners/occupants of basement floor premises.\nLobbies of 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th floors would be exclusively used by owners/occupants of respective premises on those floors.\nStaircase with landings from the 9th floor owners up to the top terrace floor level would be exclusively used by owners/occupants of 10th, 11th, and terrace floor premises.\nExclusive rights in respect of the terrace on the 11th floor level and 12th floor level have been allotted/given to specific flat owners (1101 and 1005) in the building.\nExclusive rights in respect of the entire basement floor have been allotted/given to Mr. Kishor Chheda, purchaser/allottee of flat no 1004.\nOut of the three lifts, one lift has been reserved exclusively for Mr. Kishor Chheda and his family members, as well as the owners and occupants of the 10th and 11th floors. The expenses of this lift will be borne by the occupants of these floors.\nThe THIRD SCHEDULE essentially outlines the allocation and usage of common areas and restricted common areas within the building, specifying who has exclusive rights to use certain spaces. It appears that you are contesting the builder's claim that the land and building have been transferred to the society based on this document, alleging that the builder may have sold certain areas illegally to individuals or entities.\n\nTo determine the legality of such transactions and whether perjury has been committed, you should continue to work closely with your legal counsel and provide all relevant evidence to support your case. They can help you navigate the legal process and address any discrepancies or violations related to the property.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This statement clarifies that merely receiving communication of the reasons for the rejection or the likely action of the secured creditor does not grant the person, including the borrower, the right to make an application to the Debts Recovery Tribunal under this particular subsection.\nIn other words, the communication of reasons by the secured creditor does not, by itself, provide the basis for initiating an application to the Debts Recovery Tribunal. There may be specific conditions or criteria that must be met beyond this communication to enable an application to the Tribunal. These conditions or criteria are likely defined in the relevant legal or regulatory framework governing debts recovery.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Parking disputes can be challenging to navigate, especially when you're a tenant in an apartment complex. Here are some steps you can consider taking:\nReview Your Rental Agreement: First, review your rental agreement or lease to see if it specifies any rules or restrictions regarding parking. It's possible that the agreement outlines where tenants are allowed to park.\nTalk to Your Landlord: Speak with your landlord or property manager about the parking issue. Explain your side of the situation, including the fact that you temporarily moved your car due to drainage work. Ask if there are any designated parking areas for tenants and if there are any available spaces.\nCommunicate with the Bank Manager: If the bank manager is causing issues, try to have a polite and respectful conversation with him. Explain your circumstances and inquire about a possible resolution. It's essential to maintain a civil and cooperative approach.\nLocal Authorities: If the issue persists, consider contacting your local municipal or traffic authorities to inquire about parking regulations in your area. They can provide guidance on where it is legally permissible to park and whether there are any parking restrictions on the platform.\nAlternative Parking: Explore other parking options in the vicinity, such as nearby public parking lots or spaces. Be sure to follow any local parking regulations to avoid parking violations.\nCommunity Mediation: Some communities offer mediation services to help resolve disputes between neighbors. Check if your local area provides such services.\nTenant Association: If your apartment complex has a tenant association or community board, you may want to reach out to them for assistance or advice on resolving the parking issue.\nWhen addressing this issue, it's important to remain respectful and considerate of your neighbours and the bank manager. Open communication and cooperation can often lead to a resolution that works for all parties involved.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAsk owner .ask building secretary than lately file police complaint after informing owner\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tKindly  contact to my office with all relevant  documents and call me.\nMy phone  consulting fees 1000rs \nU can contact  to my office with all relevant documents so I examine  the documents and give proper opinion thanks. \nRegards. \nPuneet Narwariya \nHigh Court Advocate \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou had parking rights by usage   request police t help you . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir put cctv camera there then go for the protest petition at the area police . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\n1. filing the police complaint will not be useful and to be resolved between you amicably\n2 let your house owner talk to you and the bank manager and find a solution\n3. if bank threatens you then you can approach the police for the suitable action and the civil court for the suitable order to the bank\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

These orders can include restraining orders that prevent your brother from harassing or threatening your parents.\nWhile protection orders can provide legal protection and prevent harassment, eviction orders are typically issued separately by a landlord-tenant court or through the proper legal process.\nEviction Process:\nTo legally evict someone from a property, specific eviction procedures must be followed under landlord-tenant laws. The process may involve issuing a legal notice, filing an eviction lawsuit, and obtaining a court order for eviction.\nYour parents can consult with a lawyer to understand the correct legal procedure for evicting your brother from their property.\nDuration of Legal Process:\nThe duration of the legal process can vary widely depending on the complexity of the case, court caseload, and the specific legal procedures involved.\nIt's essential for your parents to discuss the timeline and potential delays with their lawyer to manage expectations. In some cases, the legal process can take several months or longer.\nMedical and Living Arrangements:\nIf your parents are facing health concerns due to their current living arrangements, it's crucial to document these concerns and share them with their lawyer. This information can be relevant to the court when considering protection orders or eviction orders.\nContinued Legal Assistance:\nYour parents should continue working closely with their lawyer to navigate the legal process effectively and ensure their rights are protected.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWrite notice in national newspapers tell son departed from all property rights he will not have any right in property people are cautioned not to give money to himthinking his parents grandchildren will  pay he and his family kids are not allowed he dead for parents give property to other kids not to him inform police  stationgive paper publication immidately I n national local diary inform police station leave house for 15 days call me I will help\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tComplaint before district collector under senior citizenship Act.

It would be helpful to evaluate the exact position of the case and also to advise you on the next course of actions.\nThanks and regards,\nBidhayak Acharyya\nAdvocate\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Here are the general steps and documents you'll typically need to follow to release a mortgage:\n\nLoan Repayment: Ensure that you have fully repaid the mortgage loan, including the principal amount and any accrued interest, to the bank or lending institution.\n\nRequest a No Objection Certificate (NOC): Contact your bank or lending institution and request a No Objection Certificate (NOC) or a Mortgage Release Letter. This document confirms that the loan has been fully repaid and that the bank has no further claim on your property.\n\nProperty Inspection: The bank may inspect the property to verify its condition and ensure that there are no encroachments, illegal constructions, or other issues that could affect the property's value or security.\n\nLegal Documentation: Once the bank is satisfied with the repayment, they will provide you with the NOC or Mortgage Release Letter. This document should be on the bank's letterhead and signed by an authorized representative.\n\nStamp Duty: In some jurisdictions, you may need to pay stamp duty on the NOC or Mortgage Release Letter, depending on local laws and regulations.\n\nRegistration: In some cases, you may be required to register the NOC or Mortgage Release Letter with the local land registry office to ensure that it is legally recognized and recorded as evidence of the mortgage release.\n\nNotification to Credit Bureaus: Ensure that the bank reports the mortgage release to credit bureaus to update your credit record accordingly, reflecting that the loan has been paid off.\n\nRetrieval of Original Documents: After completing the necessary formalities, you should receive the original property documents that were held as security by the bank. These documents may include the title deed, sale deed, and any other relevant property-related documents.\n\nKeep Records: It's crucial to maintain copies of all documents related to the mortgage release, including the NOC or Mortgage Release Letter, payment receipts, and any correspondence with the bank. These documents serve as evidence that the mortgage has been released.\n\nNotify Relevant Authorities: Depending on local requirements, you may need to notify other relevant authorities, such as the municipal corporation or housing society, about the mortgage release.\n\nPlease note that the specific procedures and requirements for releasing a mortgage may vary by jurisdiction and may depend on the terms of your mortgage agreement with the bank. It's essential to consult with your bank, a legal professional, or a real estate expert familiar with local regulations to ensure that you complete the process correctly and legally release the mortgage from your property documents.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Here are some key considerations:\nPartition Deed Terms: The terms and conditions of the partition deed play a crucial role in determining property ownership and transfer rights. If the partition deed clearly states that your mother was allocated a specific share of the property as her rightful share, she would typically have ownership rights over that share.\nOwnership Rights: If your mother has clear ownership rights to the property share allocated to her in the partition deed, she generally has the legal authority to transfer that share to any of her children, including her sons and daughter, without requiring permission from anyone else.

While you may have evidence of verbal harassment and being thrown out of the matrimonial house, the timing of filing a case can affect its proceedings. Here are some points to consider:\nLimitation Period: Many legal actions have a limitation period, which is the maximum time within which you can file a case after an incident occurs. In matrimonial cases, this period can vary depending on the specific nature of the case and the applicable laws in your jurisdiction. If you file a case beyond this limitation period, it may be considered time-barred, and the court may dismiss it. Section 12 applications under the Act, should generally be filed within one year from the date of the incident but you can apply for exception if you have any ground. \nEvidence: While you have evidence of verbal harassment and being thrown out of the matrimonial house, it's essential to consult with your advocate to understand the admissibility of this evidence and its relevance to your case. Your lawyer can help you present this evidence effectively in court.\nRestitution of Conjugal Rights: Your husband filing for restitution of conjugal rights suggests an intention to continue the marriage. However, if you have concerns about your safety or the marriage's viability, it's important to discuss these concerns with your lawyer and consider legal options that protect your rights and interests.\nInfluence and Contacts: While influence and contacts can sometimes play a role in legal proceedings, it's crucial to focus on the merits of your case and your legal rights. Your advocate should work diligently to represent your interests and ensure that the court considers your evidence and arguments impartially.\nConsult with Another Lawyer: If you have concerns about your current lawyer's advice or representation, you have the right to seek a second opinion from another qualified legal professional. They can review your case and provide guidance based on their expertise.\nMediation or Settlement: In some cases, parties may consider mediation or negotiation to reach a settlement, especially in matrimonial disputes. This can be an option to explore with the guidance of your legal counsel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

Property laws can vary significantly from one place to another, so it's essential to consult with a legal expert or attorney who is familiar with the laws in your area for precise guidance.\n\nIn many cases, a property owner has the right to transfer their share of the property to whomever they wish through a will, gift deed, or sale, provided they are the legal owner and there are no specific legal restrictions in place. However, some jurisdictions may have rules or restrictions on the transfer of ancestral or jointly held property. Additionally, if there are any existing agreements or conditions related to the partition of the property, those agreements should be reviewed carefully, as they may also impact your mother's ability to transfer her share unilaterally.\n\nTo ensure that your mother's intention to transfer the property is legally sound and compliant with local laws, it is strongly advised to consult with a legal expert or attorney who can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances and the legal framework in your area. They can help draft the necessary documents and navigate any legal requirements or restrictions that may apply.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nThe ability of your mother to write or transfer the property to any of her children without needing permission depends on several factors, including the specific legal framework governing property rights and transfers in your jurisdiction and the terms of the partition deed. Here are some key considerations:\nPartition Deed Terms: The terms and conditions of the partition deed play a crucial role in determining property ownership and transfer rights. If the partition deed clearly states that your mother was allocated a specific share of the property as her rightful share, she would typically have ownership rights over that share.\nOwnership Rights: If your mother has clear ownership rights to the property share allocated to her in the partition deed, she generally has the legal authority to transfer that share to any of her children, including her sons and daughter, without requiring permission from anyone else. However, this may vary depending on state-specific laws.\nConsent of Co-Owners: If the partition deed involves co-owners, such as other family members who received shares, your mother's ability to transfer her share may depend on their consent or any specific conditions outlined in the partition deed.\nLegal Requirements: It's essential to consult with a legal professional in your jurisdiction to understand any specific legal requirements or procedures for property transfers, such as the need for property registration, payment of stamp duty, and compliance with local property laws.\nPotential Family Agreement: While it may not always be a legal requirement, it's often a good practice for family members to discuss and reach a consensus on property matters to avoid disputes and maintain harmonious relationships.\nGiven the complexity of property transfers and the need to ensure that any transfer complies with applicable laws and the terms of the partition deed, it is strongly recommended to consult with a qualified lawyer who specializes in property and real estate matters in your specific jurisdiction.

However, false information was provided in the will stating that your grandmother had no sons, and the will was registered with your father's family kept unaware.\nIn this situation, it's essential to understand that wills and their validity are subject to the applicable laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. Here are some general points to consider:\nValidity of the Will: The validity of a will can be subject to legal scrutiny, especially if there are concerns about false information or undue influence. In many legal systems, a will should accurately represent the testator's wishes, and it should be made without any coercion or fraudulent information.\nChallenging the Will: If you believe that the will is not valid due to false information or other irregularities, you may have the option to challenge it in court. However, the specific legal procedures and requirements for challenging a will can vary depending on your jurisdiction's laws.\nConsult with a Lawyer: It is highly advisable to consult with a lawyer who specializes in wills and estate matters in your jurisdiction. They can provide you with guidance on the appropriate steps to take and whether it's feasible to challenge the validity of the will.\nEvidence and Documentation: If you decide to challenge the will, it's important to gather all relevant evidence and documentation that can support your case. This may include any records or evidence related to the false information provided in the will.\nMediation or Settlement: In some cases, parties may consider mediation or negotiation to reach a settlement regarding the distribution of assets. Your lawyer can advise you on whether this is a viable option in your specific case.\nLegal Process: If the matter goes to court, be prepared for a legal process that can involve hearings, evidence presentation, and legal arguments. The court will ultimately make a determination based on the applicable laws and the evidence presented.\nPlease keep in mind that this response provides general information, and the specific legal procedures and outcomes can vary depending on your jurisdiction and the details of your case.

It introduced various provisions to regulate land ownership, land use, and tenancy rights. To answer your questions:\n\nIntermediary or Agent as Landowner: Under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, intermediaries or agents generally cannot be the owners of agricultural land. The Act aimed to abolish the zamindari system and vested ownership rights in the actual tillers of the land. Intermediaries or agents would typically not qualify as the actual cultivators or tillers unless they meet specific criteria outlined in the Act.\n\nOccupier Registering as Raiyat Sthitiban: The Act allows for the recognition and registration of raiyats and under-raiyats who are in actual possession of land. If someone is an occupier and meets the criteria for being recognized as a raiyat or under-raiyat under the Act, they may be eligible to register as such. However, this recognition would be subject to the conditions and qualifications outlined in the Act.\n\nOccupier Registering Land for an Intermediary: Generally, the Act does not permit an occupier to register land they occupy in favor of an intermediary or agent. The Act's primary objective is to vest land rights in the actual cultivators or tillers (raiayats and under-raiyats) and to abolish intermediaries.\n\nIntermediary Selling Land: Under the West Bengal Land Reforms Act, intermediaries generally cannot sell land given to them by the actual owner. The Act aimed to break the intermediaries' hold on agricultural land and distribute landownership to the actual tillers. Intermediaries had their rights limited by the Act, and their ability to sell land to others was restricted.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir kindly tell the actual scene, all this is second step  , first  tell the original things . then these step will be clear . to answer . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In some cases, the police might consider an incident like theft (including your lost bag) as cognizable.\nNon-Cognizable Offense: Non-cognizable offenses are those for which the police cannot arrest a person without a warrant and generally require a court's permission to initiate an investigation.\nIn your case, if someone took your bag from a railway platform, it could be considered theft, which is typically a cognizable offense. However, the police's response may also depend on factors such as the value of the items in the bag and their assessment of the situation.\nIf the police decide to treat the case as non-cognizable, it doesn't necessarily mean they won't investigate. They may still record your complaint and attempt to gather evidence, including reviewing CCTV footage if available.\nIn practice, police officers often show complainants CCTV footage to aid in investigations, even for non-cognizable offenses, as it can help identify potential suspects. The decision to register a complaint and investigate a case often involves discretion on the part of the police based on the facts and circumstances presented.\nIf you have concerns about how your case is being handled or if you believe a cognizable offense should be registered, you may want to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance and advocate on your behalf with the police.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo case under section 403 IPC is made out if you have forget your bag on platform.

However, the specific outcome of asset division in a divorce case depends on various factors, including the nature of the assets, the circumstances of the marriage, and the applicable laws.\nHere are some key points to consider:\nJurisdiction: The jurisdiction where the divorce case is filed matters. Indian courts may have jurisdiction over assets located both in India and abroad. The court's jurisdiction can depend on factors such as the spouses' place of residence and the location of the marriage.\nMarital Assets: In a divorce proceeding, marital assets are typically subject to division. Marital assets are those acquired during the marriage, and they can include assets located both in India and overseas.\nForeign Assets: Indian courts can consider foreign assets when dividing marital property. However, enforcing division orders for foreign assets can be complex and may require cooperation with authorities in the foreign country where the assets are located.\nPre- or Post-nuptial Agreements: If you and your husband have a prenuptial or postnuptial agreement that outlines the division of assets in the event of a divorce, this agreement can influence the court's decision.\nUK Passport: Having a UK passport while your husband has an Indian passport may not directly impact the division of assets. The division is typically based on marital property and other relevant factors, rather than nationality or passport status.\nLegal Advice: To protect your interests and understand how divorce laws may apply to your specific situation, it's essential to consult with an experienced divorce attorney who can provide guidance on asset division and international aspects of your case.\nIn summary, Indian divorce laws can potentially subject both Indian and overseas assets to division in a divorce case. The outcome will depend on various factors, and it's crucial to seek legal advice to understand how these laws apply to your specific circumstances.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Madam,\nThe proposition of law is if a female Hindu dies intestate without leaving any issue, then the property inherited by her from her father or mother would go to the heirs of her father whereas the property inherited from her husband or father-in-law would go to the heirs of the husband. \n\nIn your case, inheritance from your father, after your life your sons and daughter are entitle to share the said property. in case no issues the property inherited from your parents would go back to your parents or heirs of your parents. your husband have no right over the property inherited from your parents. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tno madam husband has no right on your inheritance . what ever citizenship you have . madam why this much insecure .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Here's a breakdown of the situation:\nResignation of Board of Directors: The previous Board of Directors has resigned, and elections were conducted to choose a new body.\nTwo Occupiers Allowed to Vote: Two members of the society appealed to the High Court to allow them to vote as \"Occupiers.\" The High Court granted this permission, but the final decision on the matter is still pending.\nElections Not Stayed: The High Court's order clarified that there is no stay on the elections, implying that they should proceed as planned.\nInterpretation Conflict: There seems to be a conflict in the interpretation of the High Court's order between the old Board of Directors and the SDM's office.

It is issued by the Court to direct a public authority to perform the legal duties which it has not or refused to perform. It can be issued by the Court against a public official, public corporation, tribunal, inferior court or the government. It cannot be issued against a private individual or body, the President or Governors of States or against a working Chief Justices. Further, it cannot be issued in the following circumstances:\nThe duty in question is discretionary and not mandatory. \nFor the performance of a non-statutory function. \nPerformance of the duty involves rights of purely private nature.\nWhere such direction involves violation of any law. \nWhere there is any other remedy available under the law.\nThe writ of mandamus is issued for keeping the public authorities within their jurisdiction while exercising public functions. The object of mandamus is the prevention of disorder emanating from failure of justice that is required to be granted in all cases where there is no specific remedy established in law. It cannot be issued when the government or public official has no duty to perform under the law. \nA writ petition seeking mandamus must be filed by a person in good faith and who has an interest in the performance of the duty by the public authority. The person seeking mandamus must have a legal right to do so and also must have demanded the performance of the duty and it is refused by the authority.\nIn All India Tea Trading Co. v. S.D.O. (AIR 1962 Ass 20) case, the Land Acquisition Officer erroneously refused to pay the interest on compensation amount. A writ of mandamus was issued against the Land Acquisition Officer directing him to reconsider the application for the payment of interest.\nIn Suganmal v. State of M.P. (AIR 1965 SC 1740) case, the petitioner (person who files the writ petition) filed for issuing a writ of mandamus to direct the respondent (opposite party in the writ) for refunding tax. The Supreme Court held that where an assessment order was set aside and the rules concerned did not provide for refund of tax levied, a writ of mandamus cannot be issued. The proper remedy is filing a suit for claiming the refund.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The TRAI has a National Do Not Call Registry, which allows consumers to register their phone numbers to avoid receiving unsolicited calls.It is important to note that the victim should gather as much evidence as possible, such as recording the phone call or noting down the date, time, and number from which the call was received. It is also advisable to consult a lawyer to understand the legal options available and the best course of action in the particular circumstances of the case.\nIt is important to note that the victim should gather as much evidence as possible, such as recording the phone call or noting down the date, time, and number from which the call was received.

This documentation can help prevent any potential disputes or complications in the future.\nAdditionally, if you have concerns about the potential impact of your husband's status as an Indian citizen on your inheritance, it's advisable to consult with a qualified attorney or legal expert in India. They can provide you with guidance on Indian inheritance laws and help you and your parents ensure that their wishes regarding their assets are legally protected.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thusband has no right on your parents things . citizenship has no role in this . blood relation only matter . why this much insecure .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The outcome will depend on the specific circumstances and the laws of the jurisdiction in which they reside.\nHere's an overview of potential scenarios:\nMutual Consent Divorce: If both parties agree to divorce, they can file for a mutual consent divorce. This is usually the quickest and most straightforward way to end a marriage.\nContested Divorce: If one party wants a divorce and the other does not, it can lead to a contested divorce. In such cases, the spouse seeking the divorce will have to prove grounds for divorce recognized under the law. The grounds for divorce can vary depending on the jurisdiction but may include reasons like adultery, cruelty, desertion, mental disorder, and more.\nAdultery: If one spouse can prove that the other engaged in extramarital affairs, it can be grounds for divorce.\nCruelty: Suffering physical or mental cruelty at the hands of a spouse can be a valid reason for divorce.\nDesertion: If one spouse abandons the other without a valid reason for a specified period, it can be considered desertion.\nMental Disorder: If one spouse is suffering from a severe mental disorder that makes living together impossible, it can be grounds for divorce.\nLegal Separation: In some cases, couples may choose legal separation instead of divorce. Legal separation allows them to live separately and make legal arrangements for property, child custody, and support without officially ending the marriage.\nNo-Fault Divorce: Some jurisdictions have adopted \"no-fault\" divorce laws, where neither party has to prove wrongdoing. They can simply state that the marriage has irretrievably broken down.\nWaiting Periods: Some jurisdictions have mandatory waiting periods before granting a divorce. During this time, the couple may be required to attend counseling or mediation.\nRenunciation: If one spouse renounces their faith or converts to another religion, and this causes an irreparable breakdown of the marriage, it might be a ground for divorce in certain jurisdictions.\nLeprosy, Venereal Disease: In some jurisdictions, the presence of certain incurable diseases can be grounds for divorce.\nIt's essential to consult with a family law advocate in your specific jurisdiction to understand the applicable laws and procedures. Laws related to divorce can vary significantly from one place to another, and a legal expert can provide guidance based on the local regulations and circumstances of the case.\nIn cases of contested divorce, the court will typically hear both parties' arguments and evidence before making a decision on whether to grant the divorce and on matters like property division, child custody, and support.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tgo for the mutual divorce .  every reason is valid , may it be in law list or not . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It can include causing pain, abusing, torturing mentally or physically.\nDesertion- When a spouse willfully abandons another without any intention of coming back, it is known as Desertion. Desertion for more than two years could be a valid ground for divorce.\nReligion Conversion- In a Hindu marriage, if either of the spouses ceases to be a Hindu then it can be considered as a ground for divorce.\nMental Disorder- Mental disorder includes unsoundness of mind, mental illness, or such mental disorder which makes the person abnormally aggressive.\nCommunicable Diseases and Leprosy- Leprosy is a contagious and chronic disease that causes lesions on skins and nerve damage.\nSpouse not heard of- If either of a spouse is not heard of for more than seven years, then it can be considered as a ground for divorce.\nRenunciation of the world- Under the Hindu Law, the “Renunciation of the world” is a ground for divorce, if either of the spouses has renounced the world and has entered a holy order. \nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Queriest,\nThere are various grounds for obtaining divorce in India such as Adultery,Cruelty,Desertion,etc.\nIn order to obtain Divorce by Mutual Consent it is mandatory for husband and wife to live separately for a period of one(01) year.

It's essential to understand her perspective and address any issues within your marriage.\nMarriage Counseling: If communication doesn't resolve the issues, consider seeking the help of a professional marriage counselor or therapist. Marriage counseling can provide a safe space for both of you to discuss your problems and work on solutions.\nFamily Mediation: If your wife's family members are involved in the dispute, you might want to consider family mediation. A neutral third party can help mediate discussions between you, your wife, and her family to find common ground.\nLegal Consultation: If you believe that your brother-in-laws' interference is causing significant harm to your marriage and family life, you can consult with a family law advocate. They can provide legal advice on potential courses of action, such as obtaining a restraining order if necessary.\nPolice Involvement: Involving the police should typically be a last resort and should only be considered if there are instances of harassment, threats, or violence. If you feel that your safety or your wife's safety is at risk due to your brother-in-laws' actions, you can report such incidents to the local police. They may take appropriate actions to ensure your safety, which may include issuing warnings or restraining orders against the individuals involved.\nSupport Networks: Seek support from friends and family members who can provide emotional assistance during this challenging time. Additionally, consider joining support groups or seeking guidance from religious or community leaders who may have experience in resolving family disputes.\nLegal Options: If your wife is being unduly influenced to seek a divorce and you believe this is against her will or not in her best interests, you can consult with an advocate to explore legal options to protect her rights.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir first of all shift from there and change the contact number of wife and stop all relation with in laws any how . if then too in one year wife remains the same then take step what is fit for your life . sir the police can not come to the house or stop any phone call . till wife is not normal till then police too can not help .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Heavy earth-moving machinery used in construction and mining activities, such as bulldozers, excavators, and dump trucks, are specialized vehicles primarily designed for off-road or construction site use. These machines are not intended for use on public roads, and as a result, they may not be subject to the Motor Vehicles Act in the same way that regular passenger vehicles or commercial vehicles used on public roads are.\n\nInstead, the operation and regulation of heavy earth-moving machinery used in construction and mining activities are typically governed by other laws, regulations, and authorities. These may include:\n\nMines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act: This act governs the development and regulation of mines and minerals, including the use of heavy machinery in mining operations.\n\nThe Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (Section 88): This section of the Motor Vehicles Act deals with granting special permits for vehicles to operate in certain areas or for specific purposes. Heavy machinery used in construction or mining may require such permits for transportation to and from the construction or mining site.\n\nState-specific laws and regulations: Different states in India may have their own rules and regulations governing the operation of heavy machinery in construction and mining activities. These laws may cover issues such as safety standards, environmental regulations, and licensing.\n\nEnvironmental Laws: Depending on the nature of the construction or mining project, environmental laws and regulations may also apply, especially if the machinery's operation has environmental implications.\n\nIt's essential to consult with legal experts and relevant authorities in your specific location to understand the exact regulatory requirements for heavy earth-moving machinery used in construction and mining activities, as these regulations can vary from state to state and may be subject to updates or changes over time.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes to all vehicles irespectivev of any state place where it is run\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, on any vehicle capable of moving on roads \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nThe MV Act  is applicable for all the vehicles moving on the public road \nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nThe Motor Vehicles does not apply to Heavy Earth Moving Vehicles.

AS per Order 9 Rule 6 of the CPC, if the defendant does not appear before the court despite having summons served on him, the court can pass an ex parte decree .But if the summons is not duly served, the court will issue another summons to the defendant. When the summons is served properly but the defendant does not get enough time to be present in court, the court will postpone the proceeding to a future date. If the court finds that the summons was not served properly due to the plaintiff’s fault, then the court will ask the plaintiff to pay the cost of adjournment of the hearings.\n2. There are rulings to provide that the ex parte order ( Order given by court when one of the parties to a suit remain absent through out) may be set aside after paying costs.  In the case of Chhotalal Mohanlal v. Ambalal Hargovan (1925), the Bombay High Court stated if the party came late and a decree had been passed, then the party was entitled to restore his suit after paying the cost to the court. Please note that, the reason for absence must be a valid one (like summons not served properly, not served at all, he had some valid reason like disease, injury, hospitalisation etc.) otherwise the opposite party will not have any remedy. \nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfor b first need to be checked the reason for the absence. mother and sister will get the share. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf an appeal is filed and upheld by the higher court (e.g., the High Court or a higher appellate court) in a civil suit, there are specific legal consequences that can vary depending on the circumstances and the orders issued by the higher court. Here's how it generally works in the scenarios you described:\n\nDecree Passed Ex Parte Against B:\n\nIf the appeal filed by Respondent A is upheld, it typically means that the higher court has found legal errors or issues with the original judgment. In such a case:\n\nThe original decree against Respondent B (the ex parte decree) may also be set aside or modified, depending on the grounds of appeal and the orders of the higher court.\nThe higher court may order a re-trial or remand the case back to the lower court for further proceedings, allowing Respondent B an opportunity to present their case.\nDecree in Favor of Mother and Two Sisters:\n\nIf the appeal is upheld, the higher court's decision may affect the decrees in favor of your mother and two sisters in different ways:\n\nIf the higher court upholds the original judgment in your favor and the decrees in favor of your mother and two sisters, then those decrees remain valid, and they retain their respective shares of the ancestral property.\n\nIf the higher court modifies the judgment or reverses it in part, it may affect the distribution of shares or other aspects of the decree. Your mother and sisters may need to consult with their legal counsel to understand how the higher court's decision impacts their specific shares or rights.\n\nIt's important to note that the final outcome of the appeal depends on various factors, including the grounds of appeal, the evidence presented, and the legal arguments made before the higher court. The higher court's judgment will provide clarity on how it affects all parties involved.\n\nTo navigate the complexities of the legal process and understand the implications of the higher court's decision, it's essential to consult with an experienced attorney who can provide tailored advice and guidance based on the specifics of your case and the orders issued by the higher court. Legal professionals can help you and your family members navigate the legal procedures and protect your rights in the event of an appeal.\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

I was not shown any evidence earlier. But i saw the evidence was merely full day cctv recording, and no way to prove me guilty.\n\nLAter my appeal was rejected by DGM .\nThen i approached the nearest advocate and paid him fees(more than 1.5 lakh rupees till now) to file a writ petition in court.\n\nThe adv filed a Special civil application (SCA) for reinstament with respondent as \"State of Gujarat\" instead of \"SBI\".\n\nNow I have received update from the last two years that he only gets next date for hearing. and the next date is in october now.\nwhich is like 7th time in last two year matter was not taken on board and he said that the justice only takes up urgent criminal cases.\nWhen i further want to get details, he says to look for another advocate and thinks that i dont have trust on him?\nI want advice what am i doing is the best can i do ? what is my best course of action?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nSince you were forced to give such a confession, you can approach the High Court under Art. 226 for violation of your Fundamental Rights.

SBI is a Public Sector Unit and therefore, a \"State\" within the meaning of Art. 12.

This will also decide your case faster.\nIt will also better to consult another lawyer and ask him for his opinion regarding the case. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tyes sir you are on right track .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If a revision petition was filed in the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCRDC) against the Tamil Nadu State Consumer Court's decision, and the NCRDC has now passed a final order in your favor, it is generally less common for a stay order to be issued after a final order has been issued. However, it is not impossible, and it depends on various factors, including the specific circumstances of the case and the arguments presented by the opposing party.\n\nHere are some points to consider:\n\nGrounds for Stay: In order for a court to issue a stay order, the opposing party would typically need to demonstrate strong and compelling grounds. Common grounds for seeking a stay include the risk of irreparable harm, errors in the judgment, or issues related to the execution of the judgment.\n\nAppeal Process: If the opposing party wishes to challenge the final order, they may follow the proper legal procedure to appeal the decision. The appeal process involves presenting their case before a higher court, and they may request a stay during this appeal process.\n\nLegal Representation: It's important for both parties to have legal representation during any further legal proceedings. Competent attorneys can present arguments and counterarguments, which will influence the court's decision regarding a stay order.\n\nTiming: The timing of the request for a stay is crucial. Typically, requests for stays are made promptly after an unfavorable judgment is rendered. Once a final order has been issued, it can be more challenging to obtain a stay.\n\nCourt's Discretion: Ultimately, whether a court grants a stay order is at the discretion of the court. The court will consider the merits of the case, the potential harm or benefit to both parties, and the interests of justice.\n\nConsult an Attorney: If you are concerned about the possibility of a stay order, it is advisable to consult with an attorney who specializes in consumer law or appeals. They can provide you with guidance on how to respond to any stay application and can represent your interests in court.\n\nIt's important to note that each case is unique, and the outcome can vary depending on the specific facts and legal arguments involved. To get the most accurate and specific advice, consult with a qualified attorney who is familiar with the details of your case and the relevant laws in your jurisdiction. They can provide you with tailored guidance based on your situation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nYes. There is a way to get an order from the Supreme Court so as to prevent further decision by Supreme Court without an opportunity of presenting your side of the case. You may file a Caveat Application for this. A Caveat application is filed by a litigant to ensure that no adverse order is passed against them without being heard. \nIt is also important for you to understand that you cannot stop the opposite party from appealing before the Supreme Court for it is their legal right. What you can prevent is the decision of court without hearing your side. \nFile a caveat application, so that the court does not decide the case without hearing your side.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes find out the appelate court for NCRDC  .

Filing of affidavit detailing assets and liability in pending case can not be ground of appeal or revision. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI can offer some general information that may help you in your situation. To address your questions:\n\nAsset and Liabilities Affidavit without Case Number:\n\nIn many legal proceedings, including maintenance cases under Section 125 of the CrPC (Criminal Procedure Code), an Asset and Liabilities Affidavit is a required document to assess the financial status of the parties involved. While it's ideal to have the case number mentioned on the affidavit for easy reference, the absence of the case number alone does not necessarily invalidate the document.\nWhat is more critical is whether the affidavit contains accurate and complete information regarding the assets and liabilities of the party. If there are inaccuracies or if relevant information is missing, you may need to address these issues in your appeal.\nObtaining the Asset and Liabilities Affidavit with Case Number:\n\nYou can request the court or your legal representative to ensure that the case number is properly mentioned on the Asset and Liabilities Affidavit. This can be done by filing a formal request or application in the court where the maintenance case is pending.\nAppeal vs. Review Petition:\n\nWhether you should file an appeal or a review petition depends on the specific circumstances of your case. Here are some considerations:\nAppeal: If you believe there are legal errors in the judgment or order that need to be addressed, you may file an appeal in the appropriate higher court, which is usually the Sessions Court.\nReview Petition: Review petitions are typically filed in the same court that issued the judgment or order. They are used when there is an error apparent on the face of the record or when new evidence that was not available at the time of the original judgment comes to light.\nIt's essential to consult with an experienced attorney who can assess your case and provide guidance on the most suitable course of action, whether it's filing an appeal or a review petition. They will consider the specifics of your situation, including the CRLMP order and any other relevant factors.\nFor accurate legal advice tailored to your case and jurisdiction, consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in family law or criminal law in your area. They can provide you with guidance on the appropriate steps to take and help you navigate the appeals process or any other legal actions you need to pursue.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\n1.  The Affidavit  of Disclosure of Assets and Liabilities does not have a requirement of mentioning case number. So, not mentioning case number will not invalidate the document.\n2. There is a choice as to mention the case number or not. The law does not specify that case number must be mentioned.\n3. As mentioned above, there is no compulsion of adding case number. Therefore, it cannot be a ground for appeal or review as such.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\n1. it is valid\n2. nothing just file it in the court where your case is going on \n3. you can for an appeal in the sessions court or a revision in the high court\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

There are many rulings supporting that divorce cases can be represented by GPA or SPA.  However,  to be 100% sure that your case is not invalidated merely because of this GPA or SPA, please fly only if you have a valid reason.  Having a valid reason will impart more value to your father as your representative and the Court will not be able to refuse.\nThank you\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tA General Power of Attorney (GPA) or Special Power of Attorney (SPA) can be given in a contested divorce case, but it's essential to understand the implications and limitations, especially when it comes to international travel and legal matters. Here are some points to consider:\n\nGiving GPA or SPA:\n\nIn a divorce case, you can give a GPA or SPA to someone you trust, such as your parents, to handle specific legal or financial matters on your behalf.\nThe scope of the GPA or SPA should be clearly defined, specifying the powers granted and the specific actions or decisions the attorney-in-fact can make.\nTravel and Overseas Considerations:\n\nIf you plan to travel overseas during the course of a contested divorce, it's important to be aware of any court orders or legal restrictions related to travel with children or marital assets.\nIf you have minor children and share custody or visitation rights with your spouse, you may need the court's approval or a specific travel order to take the children out of the country.\nBe sure to consult with your divorce attorney about your travel plans and whether they are permissible under the circumstances of your case.\nMediation and Court Proceedings:\n\nIf mediation has failed and your husband did not attend, the divorce proceedings may continue through the court system.\nIt's important to follow the legal procedures and requirements of your jurisdiction when pursuing a contested divorce.\nConsult with your attorney to ensure that you are complying with all court orders and legal obligations during the divorce process.\nLegal Representation:\n\nHaving legal representation is crucial in a contested divorce. Your attorney can provide guidance on how to proceed, protect your rights and interests, and ensure that any legal documents, including a GPA or SPA, are prepared correctly and in compliance with the law.\nCustody and Property Matters:\n\nIf you have children and shared property, the divorce process can involve complex legal issues related to child custody, visitation, and the division of marital assets.\nYour attorney can help you navigate these matters, negotiate with your spouse or their legal counsel, and represent your interests in court.\nIt's essential to consult with an experienced family law attorney who is familiar with the laws and procedures in your jurisdiction. They can provide you with personalized advice and guide you through the divorce process, including the use of GPAs or SPAs when necessary. Additionally, they can advise you on any travel or custody-related issues that may arise during the divorce proceedings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSome states like Punjab etc gpa Or spa holder can appear before court on your behalf rest you have to check with your jurisdiction (local court) about the same for more details call on my number\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1. Till the stage of appearance you can give GPA and court will accept no doubt but at the stage of evidence your physical appearance is required because whatever things happen between both of you, you are the only person can defend your case better than your father.\nSo please consider my points once before GPA. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmadam your parents did not get married with husband , what is the hurry to move . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt appears that it's a contested divorce case and your evidence would be vital in this case.

    "data": " \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSir/Madam,\n\nIn 2022 I filed a case Under Section 125 of CrPC against my husband for my monthly maintenance and the said case was disposed of in July, 2023 by giving final order of monthly maintenance of Rs. 10000/- but my husband challenged such order before the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court by way of Criminal Revision. The Hon'ble Justice has been pleased to dispose of the said revision on 31.08.2023 with certain directions which have gone in favour of my husband and for which, I have been seriously affected. In that matter, I did not get any notice. I have perused the order and I have got to know that many points were suppressed by my husband in that revision and got favourable order. So, now I have taken decision to file Review Application before the Hon'ble Calcutta High Court.\n\nSo, I just want to know that what is the actual time period for filing such Review Application before the Hon'ble High Court in Criminal Revision matters. Please inform me urgently. \n\nThanks and Regards. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client, \nThe limitation period for filing a review petition before the High Court is 30 days from the date of the previous order. However, please take notice that if you can show sufficient cause that you were unaware of the order and that you had received no such notice, you can be excused for such delay. Please take an action urgently.\nThankyou\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe time limit for filing a review petition in the Calcutta High Court or any High Court in India is governed by the rules and provisions of the Civil Procedure Code (CPC) and the applicable High Court rules. However, it's important to note that a review petition typically cannot be filed as a matter of right, and there are specific grounds on which you can seek a review.\n\nIn the case of a criminal revision matter, you may want to consult with a qualified attorney in Kolkata who specializes in family and criminal law to understand the specific rules and procedures applicable in your jurisdiction.\n\nTypically, in civil matters, including review petitions, the time limit for filing a review application is governed by Order 47, Rule 1 of the CPC, which states:\n\n\"Any person considering himself aggrieved—\n\n(a) by a decree or order from which an appeal is allowed, but from which no appeal has been preferred,\n\n(b) by a decree or order from which no appeal is allowed, or\n\n(c) by a decision on a reference from a Court of Small Causes,\n\nand who, from the discovery of new and important matter or evidence which, after the exercise of due diligence, was not within his knowledge or could not be produced by him at the time when the decree was passed or order made, or on account of some mistake or error apparent on the face of the record, or for any other sufficient reason, desires to obtain a review of the decree passed or order made against him, may apply for a review of judgment to the Court which passed the decree or made the order.\"\n\nThis means that if you believe there are grounds for review, such as the discovery of new and important evidence or an error apparent on the face of the record, you may be able to file a review petition.\n\nHowever, the specific time limit for filing a review petition in your case may depend on the High Court rules and local regulations. Therefore, it's crucial to consult with a local attorney who can provide you with accurate information and guidance on the time frame for filing a review application in the Calcutta High Court in the context of a criminal revision matter. Your attorney will be able to assess the specific circumstances of your case and advise you accordingly.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou have two options, 1 file a review application 2 file an Special Leave Petition in Supreme Court,  it depends upon your case and you've to decide whether you want to challange before sc or hc\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If the labour court officer is not familiar with handling this type of case, here are some steps you can consider taking:\nConsult an Advocate: Seek the advice of a qualified attorney who specializes in labour law or legal matters related to your case. They can provide guidance on how to properly file a perjury case under Section 340 in the labour court and can represent your interests effectively.\nProvide Legal Documentation: Prepare and submit all necessary legal documentation and evidence to support your case. This may include an affidavit, supporting documents, and any relevant court orders or judgments.\nRequest a Meeting with Court Officials: Schedule a meeting with the labour court officer or other relevant court officials to discuss your intent to file a perjury case. Bring along your attorney to ensure that all legal procedures are followed correctly.\nCourt Rules and Procedures: Request a copy of the labour court's rules and procedures to understand the specific requirements for filing a Section 340 case. This document should outline the steps and forms necessary for initiating such proceedings.\nConsider Higher Authorities: If all else fails, you can consider contacting higher authorities within the judicial system or the labour department to seek guidance on how to proceed with your Section 340 petition.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSection 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) deals with the punishment for giving false evidence. Section 191 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) defines perjury as the intentional giving of false evidence in a judicial proceeding. Section 199 of the IPC defines the offence of fabricating false evidence.\nA perjury case can be filed in any court where the false evidence was given. In your case, the false evidence was given in a Labour Court proceeding. Therefore, you can file a perjury case in the same Labour Court.\nThe Labour Court officer may not be familiar with the procedure for registering a perjury case. You can try to explain the procedure to them, or you can ask them to refer the matter to a more senior officer. You can also consult with a lawyer who specializes in labour law.\nHere are some of the documents that you may need to file a perjury case in the Labour Court:\nA complaint petition that sets out the facts of the case and the evidence that you have to support your allegations.\nAn affidavit that swears to the truth of the allegations in your complaint petition.\nCopies of any documents that support your allegations, such as the false evidence that was given in the Labour Court proceeding.\nIf you are successful in your perjury case, the person who gave the false evidence could be punished with imprisonment for up to 7 years and/or a fine.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf perjury has been committed before the labor court, then petition for perjury has to be entertained by the same court before which perjury has been committed. If labor court thinks it has no jurisdiction to entertain such petition, ask them to pass appropriate order/orders regarding rejection of the petition. You can then challenge this order before High Court and High court in this regard can pass legal direction to accept this petition.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tApplication under section 340cr.p.c. is not maintainable in labour Tribunal as it is not a court. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCollect the relevant evidence to show it's perjury and file a private complaint before the honorable court having jurisdiction, for more details you can contact me. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt appears that you are facing challenges in registering a petition under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) read with Sections 191 and 199 in the labor court. This can indeed be a unique situation, as labor courts typically handle employment-related disputes rather than criminal matters like perjury.\n\nHere are some steps you can consider taking to address this issue:\n\nConsult an Attorney: It's advisable to consult with a qualified attorney who has experience in handling perjury cases and is familiar with the local legal procedures. They can provide you with guidance on the specific steps to take and help you navigate the process.\n\nClarify the Jurisdiction: Confirm whether the labor court is indeed the appropriate forum to file a perjury case. In some situations, perjury cases may be handled by regular criminal courts rather than specialized labor courts. Your attorney can assist you in determining the correct jurisdiction.\n\nReview Relevant Laws: Ensure that you have a clear understanding of the relevant legal provisions, including Section 340 of the CrPC and any other applicable laws. This will help you present a strong case for registering the petition.\n\nRequest for Clarification: Write a formal letter or application to the labor court, requesting clarification on the process for registering a perjury case in that court. Mention the specific legal provisions you are relying on and explain the relevance of the case to your pending labor court matter.\n\nSeek Transfer: If it becomes clear that the labor court is not the appropriate forum for your perjury case, you may need to file a transfer application to move the case to the correct court. Your attorney can assist you in this regard.\n\nHigher Court Intervention: In some cases, it may be necessary to seek intervention from a higher court, such as the High Court, to address the issue of registering the perjury case in the labor court. Your attorney can guide you on the procedure for filing such an application.\n\nCollaborate with Legal Experts: Consider collaborating with legal experts or organizations specializing in labor law and labor court matters. They may have insights or resources to help you navigate this unique situation.\n\nRemember that legal procedures can be complex and vary by jurisdiction. Consulting with an experienced attorney who can provide tailored advice and assistance is essential in this situation. They will be able to help you determine the most appropriate course of action to register your perjury case and ensure that your legal rights are protected.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It's essential to consult with a qualified attorney who specializes in property and contract law in your jurisdiction for specific legal advice tailored to your circumstances. Here are some steps you might consider:\n\nConsult an Attorney: The first and most crucial step is to consult with a legal professional who can assess your situation and provide you with advice based on the specific laws and regulations in your jurisdiction. An attorney can guide you on the best course of action.\n\nGather Documentation: Collect all relevant documents related to the land sale agreement, including the original agreement, communication records between your dad and the other party, bank statements, and any other evidence that may be useful in understanding the situation.\n\nExamine the Agreement: Review the terms of the original agreement carefully. Check if there were any clauses related to bounced checks or the consequences of non-payment. Understanding the agreement's terms is crucial in determining your legal obligations.\n\nReview the Statute of Limitations: In many jurisdictions, there are statutes of limitations that limit the time within which a party can bring a legal action for breach of contract. Your attorney can help you determine whether the claim falls within the statute of limitations.\n\nNegotiation: Your attorney may try to negotiate with the other party to find a mutually agreeable solution. This could involve discussing payment arrangements or exploring alternatives to resolve the matter.\n\nDefending the Case: If a legal action is initiated against you, your attorney will help you prepare a defense. They will represent your interests in court and ensure that your rights are protected.\n\nConsider Financial Options: If you do not have the financial means to repay the amount claimed, discuss your financial situation with your attorney. They can help you explore possible options, such as reaching a settlement, if appropriate.\n\nMediation or Arbitration: In some cases, mediation or arbitration can be an alternative to a lengthy court battle. These processes can help parties reach a resolution outside of the courtroom.\n\nIt's important to act promptly and work closely with your attorney to address this legal issue. Remember that laws can vary by jurisdiction, and legal proceedings can be complex, so having professional legal guidance is crucial in this situation. Your attorney will help you navigate the specific legal aspects of your case and advise you on the best way to proceed.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Appeal Number: The specific format for the appeal number may vary depending on the rules and practices of your State Consumer Forum. Typically, it would be referred to as \"First Appeal No.\" or simply \"Appeal No.\" followed by the year in which the appeal is filed (e.g., Appeal No. 2023). You should follow the format that is commonly used in your jurisdiction.\n\nStay Application: Whether or not to submit a stay application along with your appeal depends on the circumstances of your case. If you believe that the enforcement of the District Consumer Forum's decision should be temporarily halted while your appeal is pending, you may consider submitting a stay application. However, the need for a stay application and the specific procedures involved should be discussed with your attorney, as it can vary based on the nature of your case and local rules.\n\nE-Filing: It's a positive step that you have the option to e-file your appeal. Make sure to follow the instructions provided during the e-filing process, and if there is an option for \"F.A,\" you should select it if it is relevant to your appeal. If you have any doubts or questions during the e-filing process, it's advisable to seek assistance from the Consumer Forum's office or your attorney.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou should fike fa of 2023and petition for stay petition go to court personally fike itcall me I will help u\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In this case has the cyber cell given you any reason for freezing your account? In this regard you can make any application to the authorities to provide you the reason for freezing your account since you are a complainant in this case and not an alleged culprit. If the cyber cell does not provide any reason, you can move a petition before the Kolkota High Court seeking a direction to provide valid reason for freezing your account by them and if they aren't able to provide any valid reason, you may seek the order / direction of the court for releasing  your account.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can file application in court to get the bank account defreezed on superdari. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear client,\nTo release the amount from the bank, the victims need a court order.

Here's a general overview of the process:\nContact the Pension Disbursing Authority: Get in touch with the office responsible for disbursing pensions in West Bengal. This is often the Finance Department or the State Pension Directorate.\n\nSubmit Necessary Documents:\nProvide copies of essential documents, including your promotion order, appointment letters, and any other records that establish your service history and entitlements.\nFill out any pension application forms or paperwork required by the pension authority.\nVerification of Service: The pension authority will verify your service history based on the documents you provide. They may also seek information from your former employer or department.\n\nCalculation of Pension: Once your service history is verified, the pension authority will calculate your pension benefits based on the rules and formulae applicable in West Bengal. Your promotion order indicating 24 years of service should be considered in this calculation.\n\nApproval and Disbursement: After your pension application is processed and approved, you will start receiving your pension payments. This will typically be on a monthly basis.\n\nFollow-Up: Maintain regular communication with the pension disbursing authority to stay updated on the status of your pension claim. Ensure that all necessary paperwork is complete and accurate.\n\nResolution through Legal Proceedings: If your case is already pending at the State Administrative Tribunal in West Bengal, keep the tribunal informed about the progress of your pension claim. The tribunal's decision may have a bearing on your pension entitlement.\nIt's crucial to adhere to the specific rules and regulations governing pension benefits for government employees in West Bengal. The promotion order mentioning 24 years of service should be a valuable document in establishing your eligibility for a pension. However, it's advisable to consult with a legal expert who specializes in West Bengal pension matters to guide you through the process and address any state-specific nuances in your case.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In other words, the property is being transferred without any reservations, limitations, or rights retained by the seller.\nAn Absolute Sale Deed is used to confirm that the seller has an unencumbered and undisputed right to sell the property and that the buyer is receiving clear and absolute ownership.\nThe term \"absolute\" is often used to reassure the buyer that there are no hidden liabilities or claims on the property.\n\nIn summary, while both a Sale Deed and an Absolute Sale Deed serve the purpose of transferring property ownership, the latter emphasizes the absence of any conditions, encumbrances, or limitations on the property being conveyed. The use of \"absolute\" in the deed underscores the completeness and finality of the property transfer, providing additional assurance to the buyer regarding the property's title and ownership.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir no difference it is same thing . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nit doesn't  any difference\nregistrar is registering the document so it is going on\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Different states in India have their own regulations regarding permits for commercial vehicles.\n\nNature of the Accident: The circumstances of the accident may also play a role. If the accident occurred while the dumper was engaged in a mining activity and was within the scope of its contract with Coal India, it might be seen as an industrial accident rather than a transportation-related incident.\n\nConsult with Legal Counsel: It's advisable to consult with a legal expert, especially one well-versed in transportation and mining regulations in both Maharashtra and Jharkhand. They can review your specific contract with Coal India, the nature of the accident, and the applicable laws to provide you with accurate guidance.\n\nInsurance Company: Engage with your insurance company to discuss the situation in detail. Provide them with all relevant information about the accident, the vehicle's usage, and your contract with Coal India. They may be able to clarify their specific requirements and whether there are any exceptions or special considerations in your case.\n\nState and Central Authorities: Contact the transport and mining authorities in both Maharashtra and Jharkhand to inquire about the specific permit requirements for mining dumpers operating within mining sites. They may be able to provide guidance or exemptions for vehicles operating solely within industrial or mining areas.\n\nDocument Everything: Ensure you maintain thorough documentation of the accident, contracts, permits (if any), correspondence with authorities and insurance companies, and any legal advice you receive. This documentation can be crucial in resolving the issue.\n\nUltimately, the specific permit requirements and exemptions can vary by location and the nature of the operation. Seeking legal counsel and engaging in a constructive dialogue with both the insurance company and relevant authorities will be crucial in resolving this matter and ensuring compliance with applicable regulations.\n\nYou may call or mail me through pathlegal for professional assistance, clarification and advice.\n\nPlz LIKE in appreciation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

These permits are issued by the relevant transport authorities and are necessary to ensure that vehicles comply with safety and regulatory standards. The requirement for permits is not limited to public roads; it often applies to vehicles operating in various industrial or mining areas as well.\n\nHere are some key points to consider:\n\nMining Permit: Operating a commercial mining dumper within a mining area, even if it's not on public roads, may still require a specific permit related to mining operations. These permits are often issued by the state government's mining department.\n\nTransport Permit: In addition to mining permits, commercial vehicles like dumpers may also require transport permits if they are transporting goods within or between states. The specifics of these permits can vary based on the type of vehicle and its usage.\n\nContractual Agreements: The terms of your contract with Coal India or any other entity may impact the permit requirements. It's important to review your contract to see if it addresses permit responsibilities or if there are any provisions related to compliance with local regulations.\n\nConsult with Legal Counsel: Given the complexity of regulatory requirements and contractual obligations, it's advisable to consult with legal experts who specialize in mining and transportation laws.

For rest details are required to be examined to suggest remedy. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSupreme court has declared since 2013 that GPA is not valid instrument for transfer of immovable property.

However the will is relevant only after death of testator and the testator has relinquished his right in your favor during his lifetime. Since the day of relinquishment, the gpa and will stands revoked by operation. You need not worry unless she has a sale deed or gift deed.

This might include communication with the other party involved in the transaction, proof of the transaction's purpose, and any identification or KYC details related to your Binance account.\n\nLegal Assistance: If you believe your account is wrongly frozen, consider consulting with a legal professional who specializes in financial and banking matters. They can help you navigate the legal aspects and ensure your rights are protected.\n\nFather's RTGS Transaction: Regarding the 4 lakh rupees sent by your father through RTGS, he can contact his bank to inquire about the possibility of reversing the transaction. Banks may have specific policies and procedures for handling such requests, and the outcome may depend on various factors, including the status of the recipient's account and the bank's policies.\n\nComplaint to Regulatory Authorities: If you believe your bank is not handling the situation properly and you have exhausted all other options, you can consider filing a complaint with the appropriate regulatory authority in India, such as the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) or the Banking Ombudsman. They can investigate and intervene in cases of disputes between customers and banks.\n\nRemember that this is a complex legal and financial matter, and it's crucial to seek advice from professionals who can provide guidance specific to your situation. Do not take any actions without consulting with a legal expert or a financial advisor, as improper steps could complicate the resolution of the issue.\nYou may call or mail me through pathlegal for professional assistance, clarification and advice.\n\nPlz LIKE in appreciation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The fact that the cheque is exhibited in the chief examination of the complainant is strong evidence that the cheque was indeed dishonoured. The Conviction of an accused  in a 138 NI Act case depends on a number of factors, including the evidence presented by the prosecution, the defense arguments, and the judge's interpretation of the law. \nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, accused be convicted. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes accused can be convicted on the basis of marked exhibit.

Minakshi Gala\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI can provide some general information on the matter you've described.\n\nSection 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881, deals with the offense of dishonor of a cheque for insufficiency of funds or if it exceeds the amount arranged to be paid by the drawer's account. In cases related to dishonored cheques, several factors and legal principles come into play:\n\nCheque Amount: In the scenario you've described, the cheque was dishonored for Rs. 25 lakh. This suggests that the cheque amount exceeded the funds available in the drawer's account.\n\nEndorsement: If there is an endorsement on the cheque that indicates a limit (e.g., \"not for above Rs. 10 lakh\"), it may be considered as a condition placed on the use of the cheque. However, this condition may not necessarily absolve the drawer of the responsibility for the cheque's dishonor if it exceeds the available funds.\n\nCrossed Cheque: Whether the cheque was crossed or not may also be relevant. Crossed cheques are meant to be paid into a bank account and not encashed over the counter. The presence or absence of a crossing may impact the legal considerations.\n\nQuestioning Witnesses: In a legal case related to a dishonored cheque, both the prosecution and the defense may present witnesses and evidence to support their respective arguments. The court will consider all the evidence, including the testimony of witnesses, documents, and the applicable laws.\n\nUltimately, whether the accused will be convicted in this case depends on various factors, including the specific details of the case, the evidence presented, and how the court interprets the law. Legal proceedings are highly fact-specific, and the outcome can vary based on the circumstances and the arguments presented by both parties.\n\nIf you are directly involved in such a case, it is crucial to consult with a qualified legal professional who can provide you with advice tailored to your specific situation. They can assess the details of your case, evaluate the evidence, and guide you through the legal process. Legal proceedings should be handled by experienced lawyers who can represent your interests effectively in court.\n\nYou may call or mail me through pathlegal for professional assistance, clarification and advice.\n\nPlz LIKE in appreciation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It does mean that the case has been filed in the Supreme Court. It does not mean that the case has been accepted or rejected yet. In general, it may take a few weeks or even months for the Supreme Court to decide whether to accept or reject a case. If the case is accepted, it will be listed for hearing before a bench of judges.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn India, when a case is filed in the Supreme Court of India, it is assigned a diary number. The diary number is a unique identification number given to each case to keep track of its status and progress within the court system. So, when you have been provided with a diary number, it indicates that the case has been filed in the Supreme Court.\n\nAs for the time it takes for the Supreme Court to accept or reject a case after the generation of a diary number, it can vary. The Supreme Court receives a significant number of cases, and the timeline for processing them can depend on various factors, including the complexity of the case, the workload of the court, and other pending cases.\n\nTypically, after a case is filed and assigned a diary number, it goes through the process of scrutiny and listing. The court registry reviews the case to ensure that it meets the necessary formalities and is ready for consideration by the court. This process can take some time, and the court may prioritize cases based on their urgency or importance.\n\nIf the opposite parties have filed an application against the order of the National Consumer Disputes Redressal Commission (NCDRC) in the Supreme Court, you should keep an eye on the progress of the case by periodically checking the status with the Supreme Court registry or through their official website. You can also consult with your legal representative to stay informed about any developments in your case.\n\nPlease note that the timeframes and procedures for case processing in the Supreme Court can change, so it's essential to stay updated through official channels or legal counsel for the most accurate and current information regarding your specific case.\n\nYou may call or mail me through pathlegal for professional assistance, clarification and advice.\nPlz LIKE in appreciation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This is because the law does not recognize separation as a legal dissolution of marriage. If your husband does not file for divorce within 3 years of separation, he can lose his right over the property. This is because the law provides that a spouse who does not file for divorce within 3 years of separation is deemed to have abandoned the marriage. In the event of your demise, your husband will still have a legal right over your share of the property. This is because the law does not recognize common law marriage in India. As a result, your husband will be considered your legal heir and will be entitled to inherit your share of the property.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\thusband has no right on wife property any how , till the wife don't make any will in husband name . no madam your property is safe . husband is never legal heir to wife , no .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If he is not willing to negotiate, then you may need to take legal action. You can file a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) in your state.

It's frustrating when there are delays in such matters, but there are steps you can take to pursue this matter. Here's some guidance:\n\nContact the Indian Mission Again: While it may have been months without an update, consider reaching out to the Indian mission in your country again. Politely inquire about the status of your application and request any information they can provide regarding its progress.\n\nCheck the MHA Website: The MHA may have guidelines and information related to citizenship applications on their website. You can often find relevant forms, requirements, and contact information there. Make sure you have submitted all necessary documents and information.\n\nLegal Assistance: If there are significant delays and you believe that your application is not being processed as it should be, you may want to consult with a legal expert who specializes in immigration and citizenship matters. They can provide advice, assess the situation, and guide you on the best course of action.\n\nContact the MHA Directly: While it's unusual for applicants to directly contact government agencies like the MHA, you can try reaching out to them via email or phone. Explain your situation concisely and politely, providing any reference numbers or information you have regarding your application.\n\nConsider Local Legal Aid: If you're facing difficulties in your current country of residence, consider seeking legal assistance there. Immigration attorneys or legal aid organizations may be able to assist you in navigating the application process or dealing with delays.\n\nKeep Records: Ensure you maintain copies of all correspondence, application forms, receipts, and any communication with the Indian mission or legal experts. This documentation can be crucial if you need to escalate your case.\n\nPatience: Be aware that bureaucratic processes can be slow, especially when dealing with matters of citizenship. While it's frustrating, sometimes it just takes time for the relevant authorities to review and process applications.\n\nRemember that the process for citizenship through descent can vary depending on individual circumstances and the specific documentation required. Consulting with a legal expert is generally a good idea to ensure you are following the correct procedures and addressing any issues that may arise during the application process.\n\nPlease note that my knowledge is based on information available up to September 2021, and there may have been developments or changes in Indian immigration and citizenship policies since then. Therefore, it's essential to verify any updated information from official sources and legal experts.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If the crime is of a serious nature, the investigation may be transferred to the CID or some other specialized agency. You should not give any money to the sub-inspector. You should also file a complaint against him with the higher authorities. You should wait for a few days to see if the police make any progress in the investigation. If you do not hear from them after a few days, you should follow up with them. You can check the status of the investigation by contacting the police station where the FIR was filed. You can also ask for a copy of the charge sheet, if it has been filed.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir here you did mention only the process you did follow , but not the crime which did happen , tell the crime . as when police do not help then as per the crime you can be guided about the court , but we need to know the crime scenario first . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If the court does not accept the mobile handsets as evidence, then your case may become weak. There are other pieces of evidence that you may be able to produce, such as witness testimony or documentary evidence.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn many legal systems, the admissibility of electronic evidence, including mobile chats and photographs, can be subject to specific rules and procedures. The process of admitting electronic evidence typically involves ensuring its authenticity and integrity.\n\nHere are a few points to consider:\n\n    Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act: In India, Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act relates to the admissibility of electronic records. It outlines the conditions under which electronic evidence, such as mobile chats and photographs, can be admitted in court. According to this section, electronic evidence must be accompanied by a certificate issued by a person in charge of the relevant device, confirming the accuracy of the contents. This certificate is commonly referred to as the \"65B certificate.\"\n\n    Admissibility of Mobile Handsets: If your advocate is preparing an application to produce the mobile handsets as evidence, it's likely that they are seeking to establish the authenticity of the mobile chats and photographs through these handsets. The court may consider the handsets as physical evidence that could potentially help establish the authenticity of the electronic records.\n\n    Relevance and Authenticity: To strengthen your case, it's important to establish the relevance and authenticity of the evidence you're presenting. If the mobile chats and photographs are crucial to your case, you might need to provide evidence that demonstrates their relevance to the matter at hand and their authenticity.\n\n    Expert Testimony: In some cases, expert testimony may be required to establish the authenticity and accuracy of electronic evidence, including mobile chats and photographs. This could involve a forensic expert who can verify the integrity of the data and explain its authenticity to the court.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tunder IT act . it is evidence . court will accept , it depends on lawyer to convince the court for the same . no presumptions please .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In your case, since you do not know the correct address of your husband, you can send the legal notice to his native address where his parents are residing. The parents are legally bound to accept the notice and inform the husband about it.\nSection 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (CrPC) provides for the maintenance of wife, children and parents by their relatives. Under this section, a wife can file a case for maintenance against her husband even if they are living separately. The court can order the husband to pay maintenance to the wife for her and her children's support.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttalk to the police and try to trace husband on social medea .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Here are a few points to consider:\n\n    Ex Parte Order: An ex parte order is one where a decision is made in favor of one party without the other party being present to contest it. If the order was passed without your knowledge or participation, you might have grounds to challenge it. However, this process could involve filing an application to set aside the ex parte order and presenting reasons why you were unable to attend the hearing.\n\n    Maintenance Amount: If the maintenance amount specified in the ex parte order is not accurate based on your actual income, you should gather evidence to prove your actual earnings. You might need to present documents such as pay stubs, bank statements, or other financial records to demonstrate your income accurately.\n\n    Options to Proceed: Given the complexities, it's advisable to consult with your attorney about the best course of action. You might consider filing an application to set aside the ex parte order and presenting your side of the case regarding the maintenance amount.\n\n    Enforcement Petition: An enforcement petition is typically filed when one party believes that the other party is not complying with a court order. In your case, it appears that the defense lawyer has filed an enforcement petition to ensure that you comply with the maintenance order. This could lead to further legal proceedings if the court finds that the order has not been followed.\n\n    New Judge: If a new judge is now presiding over your case, it's possible that they might review the situation differently. However, it's crucial to consult with your lawyer to understand how the new judge's involvement might impact your case.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir go for the appeal at the session court with  your salary slip job details  and your medical details . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

However, it's important to note that the process of appealing and obtaining a stay order can vary depending on your jurisdiction's laws and procedures. Generally, you would need to file an appeal and present valid reasons for requesting a stay order, such as financial constraints or other circumstances.\n\nPossibility of Stay Order:\nThe possibility of obtaining a stay order depends on the merits of your case and the arguments you present in your appeal. If you can demonstrate compelling reasons for seeking a reduction in the maintenance amount or for staying the enforcement of the order, the court might consider your request.\n\nMandatory Payment in High Court Appeal:\nIn many cases, courts might require you to deposit a portion of the due amount or a reasonable amount as security when filing an appeal to the higher court. This is often done to ensure that if the appeal is unsuccessful, the owed maintenance amount can be paid to the other party.\n\nHowever, the requirement for depositing a due amount can vary based on your jurisdiction and the specific facts of your case\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This person claimed that, there is a murder case registered against me in their police station. He said that they found my call records and chats and banking transactions that I paid to a girl for nudes and now they have found this girl dead at some delhi metro station. I have never been to Delhi however I have had these kind of services in the past. The person also said that the local police has been informed and soon I will be arrested. They provided me a phone number and said to send 8000₹ to close this case. I am 100% sure that this is a scam and I did not send them any money and informed local police about it. They advised to block the number. I would like to know if it was real and if it was can a case be filed ?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThis is purely a scam to extort money from you \nMany such  cases have been reported in the past too \nIgnore it \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nI think you have been a victim of a police impersonation scam, you also filed a police Complaint. So don't be scared the police will look into this and you may do what ever police said to do like blocking the number and providing them the number etc. You may ignore the phone call as it is a scam, if that would really happened police could not asked for bribe. So it is purely an scam, you may ignore the call and block it.\nThank you. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBased on the information you provided, it is highly likely that you were targeted by a scam call. There are several reasons to believe this:\n\nUnverified Caller: The person claimed to be an S.H.O. (Station House Officer) from a specific Delhi police station, but you did not have a way to verify their identity.\n\nUnusual and Unsubstantiated Claims: The story about a murder case, call records, chats, and banking transactions related to explicit content all sound highly unusual and lack credibility.\n\nRequest for Money: The scammer requested money to \"close the case,\" which is a common tactic in extortion scams.\n\nNo Official Communication: In genuine legal matters, law enforcement would not typically contact someone about a serious case over the phone and request payment to resolve it. Official communication is usually done through formal notices or in-person visits.\n\nNo Personal Involvement: You mentioned that you have never been to Delhi, which would make it highly unlikely that you would be involved in a murder case in that city.\n\nIt's good that you did not send any money and informed your local police about the incident. Scammers often use fear and intimidation to try to extort money from their victims.\n\nIn cases like this, it's essential to take the following steps:\n\nDo not engage with the scammer: Avoid further communication with the caller. Block their number if possible.\n\nReport the incident: Report the scam to your local police or law enforcement agency. They may provide guidance on how to proceed.\n\nKeep records: If you have any information about the call, such as the phone number, date, and time of the call, keep a record of it. This information may be useful for authorities.\n\nStay cautious: Be cautious of unsolicited calls or messages and be wary of sharing personal or financial information with unknown callers.\n\nBased on the details you provided, it is highly unlikely that a genuine case has been filed against you in this manner. Scammers often use fear tactics to exploit individuals, so it's essential to remain vigilant and take appropriate steps to protect yourself from such scams.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Legal disputes, especially those involving family matters, can be quite stressful.\n\nIf you find yourself in a legal situation you're uncomfortable with, consider the following steps:\n\nConsult Another Lawyer: If you're unsatisfied with your current advocate's advice or if you feel they are not acting in your best interests, consider consulting another lawyer for a second opinion. Sometimes a fresh perspective on the case can provide a different insight or strategy.\n\nStay Informed: Make sure you understand the specifics of the interim order and the consequences of not adhering to it. An interim order often holds until the case is finally decided. If the court has ordered a certain amount to be paid, it may lead to complications if not adhered to.\n\nNegotiate with the Opposite Party: Through your lawyer, try to negotiate with your wife or her lawyer. If paying the ordered amount is challenging, you might want to see if there's room for negotiation or if you can come to a settlement that's agreeable to both parties.\n\nRevision or Appeal: If you genuinely believe that the interim order is unfair or is based on incorrect facts, you can consider filing a revision or appeal in a higher court, challenging the order. You mentioned you've already appealed, so make sure you understand the grounds of the appeal and the chances of success.\n\nAlternative Dispute Resolution: Consider mediation or reconciliation processes which might help address the core issues without resorting to extended legal battles. Courts often encourage mediation in matrimonial disputes.\n\nLegal Aid: If affordability is a concern, consider seeking assistance from legal aid services. They often provide support to those who can't afford legal services.\n\nEmotional and Psychological Support: Such disputes can take a toll on your mental health. Consider seeking counseling or joining a support group to help navigate the emotional aspects of the situation.\n\nI must stress that I can't provide a contact number or offer direct consultation. It's essential to discuss your concerns in detail with a competent lawyer in your jurisdiction who can provide guidance tailored to the specifics of your situation. Consider reaching out to different legal professionals or services in your area to get the best possible advice.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\n\nYou need not give all the amount but the warrant amount to cancell the warrant.\nTell your advocate to stay the maintenance order till appeal is decided.\n\nPlz like if you satisfied with answer.

You can also request to be heard as an ex-parte. An ex-parte hearing is a hearing where the person who is being affected by the order is not present. In your case, the opposite party is not appearing in court, so you can request to be heard as an ex-parte. This will allow you to present your case to the Sessions Court and argue why the appeal should be dismissed.\nSection 29 of the Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act, 2005 (DV Act), an appeal against an order passed by a Magistrate Court under the DV Act can be filed in the Sessions Court. The appeal must be filed within 30 days of the order being passed.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you're facing a situation like this in a court of law, it's important to consult with legal counsel to get guidance specific to your jurisdiction and circumstances. However, I can provide a general perspective based on common legal principles:\n\nAbsence of the Appellant: Typically, if the party filing the appeal (the appellant) and their legal representation repeatedly fail to appear before the court without a reasonable explanation, it can be grounds for the court to dismiss the appeal. The rationale is that if someone initiates legal proceedings, it's their responsibility to pursue them diligently.\n\nFiling a Motion/Application: Depending on the rules of your jurisdiction, you might be able to file a motion or application requesting the court to dismiss the appeal due to the appellant's consistent non-appearance. This would be a proactive step to bring the matter to the court's attention.\n\nEx-parte Hearing: If the appellant remains absent without proper justification, the court might proceed with an ex-parte hearing where the matter is decided in the absence of the appellant. However, if you're looking for an ex-parte decision, you would need to present your case, and it would be wise to be prepared.\n\nDocumentation: Make sure to document every hearing and absence. Keep records of all the dates and events. This will be crucial when presenting your case for dismissal or in an ex-parte hearing.\n\nSeek Legal Advice: Given the complexities of legal processes and the importance of the outcome to you, it's crucial to seek advice from a legal professional. They will guide you on the best steps to take, based on the specifics of your case and jurisdiction.\n\nCheck Local Rules and Precedents: Procedures can vary from one jurisdiction to another. In some jurisdictions, the rules might dictate automatic dismissal after a certain number of missed appearances, while in others, a motion might be required. It's essential to understand the rules and procedures of your specific jurisdiction.\n\nRemember, the information provided here is general in nature. It's imperative to get legal advice specific to your situation and jurisdiction.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Only your brother could have made a legal will, and since he did not, the property will be inherited by his legal heirs. In India, the legal heirs of a person are determined by the Hindu Succession Act, 1956. Under the Act, the legal heirs of a Hindu male who dies intestate (without a will) are his wife, children, parents, and siblings. In your case, since your brother died without any children, his wife will be one of his legal heirs.  She will not have the power to make a legal will on his behalf. The property will be inherited by the remaining legal heirs, which in this case are you and your parents.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo. She does not have rights on the property.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tProperty is required to be partitioned first.

In the case of an intestate succession, the property of the deceased person is distributed among his/her legal heirs in accordance with the law.\nThe legal heirs of your brother are you and your brother's wife. Since your brother had no children, his wife is a Class I heir. This means that she is entitled to an equal share of your brother's property, along with you.\nYour brother's wife cannot make a legal will on behalf of your brother because she is not his legal heir. Only a legal heir can make a legal will on behalf of a deceased person.\nHowever, your brother's wife can make a will of her own property. If she dies without a will, her property will be distributed among her legal heirs in accordance with the law.\n\nAdv.

Their roles are somewhat different from that of an Advocate on Record (AOR) or a briefing lawyer.\n\nYou, as a litigant, certainly have the right to appoint a Senior Counsel for your case. However, the usual practice is for your advocate or briefing lawyer to consult with you and then engage the Senior Counsel on your behalf. This is because your advocate is more likely to be familiar with the intricacies of the case, the specific legal points that need to be argued, and which Senior Counsel might be best suited for the particular nature of the case.\n\nHere are a few things to consider:\n\nEngagement Process: While you can express a desire or preference for a particular Senior Counsel, the actual engagement process, including discussions about availability, fees, and briefing, is typically done through your advocate.\n\nBriefing Session: Once a Senior Counsel is engaged, there's usually a 'briefing session' where your advocate explains the case details to the Senior Counsel. You might be asked to attend this session, especially if there are complex facts or nuances that need to be explained.\n\nMultiple Lawyers: It's not uncommon for litigants to have multiple lawyers represent them in a single matter. You might have an Advocate on Record, a briefing lawyer, and one or more Senior Counsels for various hearings.\n\nCost Consideration: Engaging a Senior Counsel can be expensive, so you should be clear about the financial implications.\n\nDirect Engagement: In some exceptional circumstances, litigants might engage a Senior Counsel directly without going through an advocate. However, this is not the usual practice, and it's advisable to have an advocate to manage the procedural aspects of the case.\n\nIn any event, it's crucial to maintain open communication with your advocate. If you wish to engage a Senior Counsel, discuss this with your advocate to ensure a coordinated and effective legal strategy. Remember, the ultimate aim is to present your case in the best possible manner, and teamwork between your advocate and the Senior Counsel is paramount for this.\n\nHowever, as always, the exact practices and procedures can vary based on jurisdictional nuances and specific circumstances. It's advisable to consult with your advocate and possibly seek a second opinion if you're unsure about the way forward.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

To get a duplicate survey pavti, Go to the office of the concerned revenue department in your area. Submit an application for a duplicate survey pavti and the authority will issue the duplicate pavti.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you have lost the original survey \"pavti\" (receipt or document) from the year 2000 but have a photocopy, you may need to follow certain procedures to obtain a certified duplicate or to ensure the validity of your claims based on the document. Here's a general approach you might consider:\n\nVisit the Concerned Office: Depending on where you obtained the original \"pavti\" or the type of survey document it is, you should visit the concerned government office. This might be the local land records office, tehsil office, or any other relevant authority.\n\nFile an Application: Submit a written application explaining the loss of the original document and request a certified copy of the same. Attach the photocopy you have, if necessary. Some offices may have specific application forms for this purpose.\n\nFIR (First Information Report): In some cases, especially if the document is critical, you might be advised to file an FIR or a non-cognizable report (NCR) at the local police station stating the loss of the original document. This step helps in two ways: it protects you if the lost document is misused, and it provides a formal record that you reported the loss.\n\nNewspaper Advertisement: Some jurisdictions or offices might require you to publish an advertisement in a local newspaper about the loss of the document. This public notice serves as a warning to others that the original document is lost and that you possess only a copy.\n\nAffidavit: You might also need to get an affidavit notarized stating the loss of the original document and that you will be using the photocopy for all official purposes. The affidavit serves as a legal statement of the facts and can be used in the future, if required, to support your claim.\n\nFees: There might be nominal fees associated with obtaining a certified copy or completing other related procedures.\n\nKeep All Records: Once you've completed these processes, ensure you safely store all the related documents, including the application, FIR or NCR, newspaper advertisement, and affidavit. This will be useful for future references.\n\nConsult With an Expert: It's always beneficial to consult with a legal expert or someone familiar with land records in your area to guide you through the process.\n\nIt's essential to act promptly when you realize you've lost such a document to prevent potential misuse and to ensure you have all necessary records in place.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

There is an exemption for buildings with a plinth area of up to 75 square yards. This means that you do not need to obtain building permission for your 48 square yard construction. The exemption is provided under Section 433 of the Municipal Corporation Act, 1955. The section states that the municipal corporation may, by order, exempt any class or classes of buildings from the requirement of obtaining building permission. The GHMC has issued an order exempting buildings with a plinth area of up to 75 square yards from the requirement of obtaining building permission.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

After my maternal grandfather's death, my mother, maternal uncle and maternal grandmother became the joint owners and possessors of that property. My maternal uncle and maternal grandmother were not happy about my mother's stay at her father's home, rather, they were creating pressure upon my mother to transfer her share to my maternal uncle but my did not agree for that. \n\nIn March, 2023 my mother filed a suit for partition before the Court of Ld. Civil Judge (Sr.Division) and an ad-interim injunction granted in form of Status-Quo, directing my mother, my maternal uncle and my maternal grandmother to maintain the Status-Quo regarding alienation of the suit property and after grant of such Status-Quo, my mother got to know from one Website of West Bengal Govt that my maternal uncle and maternal grandmother already sold out their shares to third party in January, 2023 that is prior to filing of such partition suit by making side plan/sketch map, indicating the dimension of the portion of the third party as well as my mother's portion which is absolutely illegal because prior to such sale there was no partition effected between my mother and them either mutually or by the Court of Law by meets and bounds. This illegal act was reported to the Ld. Court by filing a petition and the Ld. Court directed my mother to implead the said third party as Defendant No. 3 to the suit. Accordingly, my mother impleaded the said third party as Defendant No. 3 and the Ld. Court has given new order, directing my mother and the Defendant No. 3 to maintain the Status-Quo regarding alienation and possession of the suit property. Till now, the said third party has not taken any possession due to such order. \n\nNow my mother wants to file a suit for cancellation of sale deed which is illegally executed by my maternal uncle and maternal grandmother in favour of such third party. Deed valuation is Rs. 13 Lakhs but on query it has come to know that for filing such suit my mother will have to pay Court Fee of Rs. 37000/- but she is not able to pay such Court Fee right now. Court staff and others said that such Court Fee can not be reduced or exempted. Is there any alternative remedy for filing such suit to get justice ?\n\nWill such suit for cancellation of sale deed be filed only in Civil Court ?

They are transiting to or from a third country by air. Indian citizens can enter Singapore with any mode of transportation but must depart via air or sea within the next 96 hours.\nFor more than 96 hours of stay, you have to apply for travel visa of Singapore. \n\nYou may call or mail me through pathlegal for professional assistance and advice. \nPlz LIKE in appreciation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nYes, there is a transit visa for Indian nationals who are transiting through Singapore. It is called the Visa Free Transit Facility (VFTF).Indian nationals are eligible for a 96-hour Visa Free Transit Facility (VFTF) in Singapore if they are transiting to or from a third country by air. Indian nationals are eligible for a 96-hour Visa Free Transit Facility (VFTF) in Singapore if they are transiting to or from a third country by air. This means that you can stay in Singapore for up to 96 hours without a visa, as long as you do not leave the transit area of Changi (Singapore) Airport.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIf you're transiting through Singapore's Changi Airport on separate tickets, there are several factors and regulations you'll need to be aware of, especially regarding visa requirements for Indian nationals:\n\nTransit Without Visa (TWOV) Scheme: Singapore has a Transit Without Visa (TWOV) scheme that allows travelers from certain countries, including India, to transit without a visa under specific conditions. However, as of my last update in September 2021, this program has specific requirements:\n\nYou must have a valid onward air ticket departing within 48 hours.\nYou should not be departing on a budget airline for your onward flight (this is relevant since some budget airlines may not participate in this scheme).\nYou should remain in the transit area of the airport (this is critical if you're not intending to leave the transit area).\nSeparate Tickets and Baggage: If you've booked flights on separate tickets, your baggage might not be checked through to your final destination. In such cases, you would typically need to clear immigration, collect your bags, and then check-in again for your next flight. If this is the situation, you would need a visa to enter Singapore, even if briefly.\n\nSingapore Visa: If you need to clear immigration (due to the reasons mentioned above or any other reasons), you would need to apply for a Singapore visa in advance unless you qualify for the TWOV scheme and meet all its requirements. Indian nationals typically require a visa to enter Singapore.\n\nCovid-19 Regulations: Given the pandemic situation, there might be additional restrictions, requirements, or changes to normal procedures. It's essential to check any COVID-related travel advisories or requirements set by the Singapore government and Changi Airport.\n\nContact Airlines: It would be a good idea to contact the airlines you're flying with to understand if there's any cooperation between them regarding transits, especially if the airlines have interline agreements.\n\nAlternative: If the transit seems too complicated or there are uncertainties regarding the visa, consider looking into changing the booking or route to ensure smoother transit. While this might have cost implications, it might provide peace of mind and a more seamless travel experience.\n\nBefore your journey, I highly recommend:\n\nChecking the official website of Singapore's Immigration & Checkpoints Authority (ICA) for the latest visa regulations and requirements.\nContacting the airlines involved for specific guidance.\nChecking Changi Airport's official website or contacting them directly for transit information.\nConsulting the official website or contact point for New Zealand's immigration or embassy to ensure you have all required documents and permissions for your final destination.\nAlways ensure that you're updated with the latest regulations as they can change, especially in light of evolving global situations like the Covid-19 pandemic. Safe travels!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

To do this, your mother will need to file an affidavit stating that her name in the property document is incorrect and that her correct name is the one in her Aadhaar card. She will also need to get the affidavit attested by a notary public. Once the affidavit is ready, your mother can take it to the sub-registrar's office where the property document was registered. The sub-registrar will then make the necessary changes to the property document and issue a corrected copy.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe name mismatch in your mother's Aadhaar card and property document can be resolved by getting her name changed in the Aadhaar card.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tName in Aadhar card can be changed.

FIR was registered in the case (under Section 380/448). Currently the trial is in process and case is running in district court.\n\nI would like to mention that, there was no formal rent agreement document between both us and our landlord since1988.\n\nBefore theft event, we were paying agreed rent via cheque and later via money order approx. 1200 rupees per month since landlord refused accepting the cheques from quite some time. After the event no attempt has been made to send the rent due to financial constraints and father’s health as he is paralysed.\n\nMy father is 73 years old. Since 2009 due to his worsening condition as a result of paralysis stroke in 2001 he used to visit the factory premise occasionally. He has been issued a Permanent disability certificate from govt hospital. Our factory work is in dormant state since 2009 due to his medical condition.\n\nWe have some bills of sale, purchase & labour job transactions done before 2009 for petty amounts along with 1 or 2 bills of stolen machines dated quite old.\n\nI do have a pic taken inside our factory premise before the theft where I and my father along with1 machine can be seen. Since we were suspecting that something could happen as landlord has stopped taking the rent.\n\nWe have acknowledgement of an FIR lodged in 2013 when landlord sold a part of our factory space to our factory neighbour. We registered complaint in police but proven futile. We have photos for same as well where wall is getting build.\n\nWe do have acknowledgement of FIR mentioning that in 2014 landlord tried to threaten us and he has broken the lock of our firm and he will throw our items and everything out of the premise such as machines (clearly mentioned).\n\nPost FIR, protection and safety was expected from police officials which was not provided. After this incidence, we gave accrued rent to landlord which he accepted.\n\nAgain landlord refused from accepting the rent starting January 2015 therefore we started sending money orders for same which as well he refused to accept.\n\nAt midnight in 2015 when theft took place, another tenant in landlord premises called & informed us about the theft. Landlord is running his own factory on the backside of our factory. Where he broke the window on the shared wall and entered in our factory premise and stolen everything.\n\nThe tenant who informed us of the theft, is my father’s friend but he don’t want to present himself as witness since his shop is also under the same landlord’s tenancy. Landlord has threatened all tenants from giving any statement in our favour. The day when theft happened, I sent an online email to police email address and got the receipt from Delhi commissioner.\n\nI was out of station at the time of this theft. Next day after returning, I visited police station and lodged FIR in person and also visited our factory premise with S.H.O. where Video footage and photos were taken by police.\n\nWhen we reached the backside factory, landlord workers were installing a door to cover the broken wall. Broken wall was newly constructed which is covered in the photos and video records submitted with court.\n\nInvestigation officer took bribe from accused and accused confirmed us verbally in person in one of the meeting after this event.\n\nPCR was informed same night of theft. In the chargesheet, one of the former I.O confirmed the theft activity.\n\nMatter is in court where accused had applied for bail and case state is Charge.\n\nCurrently I am jobless and I was thinking of taking the case back comparing the value of machines vs expenses happened and my current financial situation.\n\nHaving faith on the luck, I am now expecting to take a last chance via another lawyer, as I am not satisfied with our lawyer’s dedication in our case since past few dates.\n\nAlong with criminal case i.e already filed, proven futile in opposing bail of the criminal !\nAdditionally, If the complainent files Civil case in case of theft of their articles agaist the criminal(thief).\nWhat will be the loss in case complainent loses the cases against the criminal? I have heard if the complainent fails to win the Civil case, complainent has to bear the legal fees of the opposite party (i; e the one who did the theft) Please advise me on this, up to what extent it is true??\n\nAwaiting for your revert.  \n\n\nKind Regards\nCharanjeet Singh\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nI understand that you are in a difficult situation. You have lost your machines and raw materials in a theft, and you are not sure whether you should continue with the case against the landlord. If you decide to continue with the criminal case, you may be able to recover the value of your stolen property. It is important to note that there is no guarantee that you will win the case. The landlord may be acquitted, or the case may be dismissed. In addition to the criminal case, you may also want to file a civil case against the landlord. This would allow you to sue the landlord for the value of your stolen property, as well as for other damages, such as lost profits.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This is not necessary in a District Court. The Lok Adalat is a forum for alternative dispute resolution (ADR). ADR is a system of resolving disputes outside of the court system. Lok Adalats are often used to resolve civil disputes, such as property disputes, family disputes, and debt disputes. The District Court is a regular court of law. Cases are decided in the District Court by a judge.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

However, I can give you a general overview of the process:\n\nIssuance and Service of Summons: After filing your case, the court will issue a summons to the respondent (in this case, your tenant). The court usually directs the process server or bailiff to serve the summons to the respondent. In the context of the Small Causes Court in Mumbai:\n\nTypically, the summons could be served within a few days to a couple of weeks after the case is filed, but the exact timeline can vary. By the time of the next hearing, the court will expect the summons to have been served unless there are exceptional circumstances.\nAppearance of the Respondent: Once the summons is served, the respondent is expected to appear on the given date of hearing, either personally or through an advocate.\n\nFiling of Written Statement: If the respondent disputes your claims, they would be given a specific time to file their written statement, which is essentially their defense against your claims.\n\nFraming of Issues: Based on your suit and the respondent's written statement, the court will frame issues that need to be adjudicated. These issues are essentially points of contention or questions that need to be answered.\n\nEvidence Stage: Both parties will be given an opportunity to present evidence to support their claims or defenses. This evidence could be in the form of documents, witness testimonies, or any other relevant material.\n\nArguments: After the evidence has been presented, both sides will have the opportunity to make their arguments based on the evidence and the law.\n\nJudgment: After considering the evidence and arguments presented by both sides, the court will deliver its judgment.\n\nIt's important to note that the above is a broad overview, and the exact procedure can vary. Cases under the Maharashtra Rent Control Act can involve specific nuances, especially considering the nature of the sections you mentioned (which deal with aspects like unlawful subletting, repairs, and nuisance).\n\nTo navigate this process effectively:\n\nHire a good advocate (if you haven't already) who is familiar with the Maharashtra Rent Control Act and the workings of the Small Causes Court in Bandra.\nStay updated: Ensure you are in regular communication with your advocate, ask about the status of the summons and other procedural matters.\nPrepare your evidence and witnesses in advance, so you're ready when the evidence stage comes.\nLastly, always refer to the specific advice of your advocate since they'll have the most accurate and detailed understanding of your case's proceedings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The will may be Challenged as:\nThe will is not valid because it was not made in accordance with the Muslim Personal Law.\nThe will is not valid because it is not in the best interests of the widow's heirs.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen a Sunni Muslim woman marries a Christian man in India, several legal complexities arise, especially in matters related to succession and inheritance.\n\nPersonal Laws vs. Indian Succession Act: Sunni Muslims in India are generally governed by their personal laws when it comes to matters of inheritance. However, when a Muslim woman marries a non-Muslim, there are complications:\n\nUnder the Muslim Personal Law, the marriage between a Sunni Muslim woman and a Christian man would be considered void unless the man converts to Islam before the marriage.\nIf the marriage is considered void, then her inheritance would typically be governed by Sunni Muslim inheritance law.\nHowever, if she has made a will, the situation changes. The will of a Muslim who is not governed by the Shariat (i.e., when the woman is married to a non-Muslim and opts out of the Muslim Personal Law) can be governed by the Indian Succession Act.\nValidity of the Will: For the will to be valid:\n\nIt must be signed by the testator (the person making the will).\nThe testator must be of sound mind at the time of making the will.\nThe will should be attested by at least two witnesses.\nThe will should not have been made under coercion or undue influence.\nChallenges to the Will:\n\nValidity of the Marriage: Since interfaith marriages without a formal conversion or without getting married under the Special Marriage Act can be contested in India, there's potential that the marriage's validity may be challenged, impacting the will indirectly.\nCoercion or Undue Influence: If any party alleges that the will was made under coercion or undue influence, it can be challenged in court.\nQuestions of Law: There might be questions raised about which law applies: the Indian Succession Act or Muslim Personal Law. The fact that she has no Muslim legal heirs (like children or parents) might complicate this further.\nRights of the Trust: The terms and conditions governing the trust and its beneficiaries will also be examined to ensure that they are in line with legal standards.\nRecommendations:\n\nLegal Consultation: Given the complexities, it is crucial to consult with a lawyer experienced in both personal laws and the Indian Succession Act. They can guide on the potential challenges and ways to address them.\nClear Will Drafting: Ensure that the will is drafted clearly, detailing all assets and rights of the beneficiaries. The clearer and more specific the will, the fewer challenges it's likely to face.\nEvidence of Sound Mind: Any documentation or proof that showcases that the will was made without coercion and by a person of sound mind can be beneficial.\nIn summary, while the will's creator has the right to bequeath her property as she sees fit, given the complexities involved in interfaith marriages and the coexistence of personal laws with the Indian Succession Act, it's vital to be prepared for potential challenges. A consultation with a legal expert in this area is highly recommended.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In your matter if the incident has taken place in Kharghar, Raigad. So the case should be filed in the Raigad District Court, which has jurisdiction over all civil and family matters in the district. The Alibag bench also has jurisdiction over Kharghar, so you can file your case there as well.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIn Maharashtra, jurisdiction for civil suits is determined based on the subject matter and the territorial jurisdiction.\n\nTerritorial Jurisdiction:\n\nKharghar is located in the Raigad district of Maharashtra. Typically, the territorial jurisdiction for a matter arising in Kharghar would be the courts situated within the district.\nPanvel Court: Panvel has its court, and given that Kharghar falls under Panvel Taluka, it is likely that the Panvel court would have jurisdiction for most civil matters arising in Kharghar.\nAlibag Family Court: Alibag is the district headquarters for Raigad. If there is a specialized family court in Alibag, and if the matter pertains specifically to family disputes that fall under the purview of the Family Courts Act, then it might be more appropriate to approach the Alibag Family Court.\nNature of the Suit:\n\nCivil Suit: If it's a general civil suit, it would likely be appropriate for the Panvel court.\nFamily Matter: Matters like matrimonial disputes, maintenance, child custody, etc., that fall under the Family Courts Act, are typically taken up by the Family Court. If Alibag has a specialized family court, then such matters might be directed there, even if they arise in Kharghar.\nRecommendation:\n\nBefore filing any case, it's essential to consult with a local lawyer who is familiar with the courts in Raigad district. They can guide you on the specific court that would have jurisdiction for your matter.\nSometimes, even if a particular court has jurisdiction, parties might mutually agree to have their dispute adjudicated in another court. However, this would depend on the nature of the dispute and the willingness of both parties.\nAlways ensure that you're filing in the correct court to prevent any procedural issues or delays that might arise from jurisdictional challenges.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You may file a complaint with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI). The RBI is the central bank of India and it regulates the banking sector. You can file a complaint with the RBI online or by mail.\nSection 420 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, deals with fraud. The section states that whoever cheats and thereby dishonestly induces the other person to deliver any property to him or to make any payment to him or to do or omit to do anything which he would not do or omit to do, if he does not believe the deception, is said to commit fraud.\nSection 66D of the Information Technology Act, 2000, deals with cheating by personation by using computer resource.

This can include information such as:\n•\tNames and contact info\n•\tDate of Birth\n•\tSocial Security numbers\n•\tBank account information\n•\tCredit card and credit info\n•\tTrade secrets\n•\tTrademark and copyright info\nCybercrime can be accomplished through a number of ways, such as hacking, theft of passwords, fraud or misrepresentation, and other devices.\nAre There Any Defenses to Cybercrime?\nAlthough many cybercrime violations can involve serious legal penalties, there can also be some defenses to cybercrime. These may include:\n•\tAuthorization – The person being charged with cyber crimes was actually authorized to access the information\n•\tLack of knowledge – Many cyber crimes, such as internet fraud, require that the defendant knew what they were doing and intended to engage the victim in fraud. It may be a defense for instance if the person didn’t know that a certain form was fake, etc.\n•\tCoercion – It can sometimes be a defense if a person was forced to commit cyber crime under threat of harm or punishment to themselves or a loved one\nWhat If I’m Facing Cybercrime Charges?\nMany computer databases and internet devices have tracking mechanisms that record cyber activity. This can often help prove one’s innocence in a cyber crime case. These may include \"time stamps\" of when a person logged into an account; they can also tell from which location certain transactions occurred, and who authorized them.

You may wish to hire a criminal lawyer if you need assistance with a defense case. Your attorney can help locate and gather evidence that might help in proving your innocence. Also, if you need more information or research on legal issues, your lawyer can provide you with up-to-date legal info on cyber crime law\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir go for the FIR at the police department cyber cell .in person , calm down .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFile a complaint in the nearest police station.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFile a cyber complaint asap in your jurisdictional police station.\n\nClick thumbs up for my comments to appreciate!\nyou can reach me through PathLegal for consultation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

You need not worry about it and disconnect all connections with them. \nIs online data entry jobs are fake?\nit is totally scam people don't fall in to it they are not going to pay you anything they don't have proper company details or contact details you can not contact them for any issue after doing 5000rs work they will not pay..\n\nFake Data Entry Jobs To Beware Of\nHow does this fake data entry jobs racket operate?\nTwo companies, Oval Solution and Unitec Solution, get details of candidates from their online job websites profiles, such as Quikr. They offer the candidates to work from home opportunity. In Jasveer’s case, he was asked to write 120 pages by Unitec and type 10,000 captchas by Oval. Some employers even ask candidates to watch videos on YouTube. This work includes increasing video views. Jasveer was promised a remuneration of Rs 30,000 by Oval and Rs 25,200 by Unitec. Upon condition that he would complete his task within 12 days and with a 90% accuracy.\nThe scammers seem to be a full team of engineers, business developers and lawyers. They target people who have their resumes uploaded on job portals and are looking for work. They also lure people in by sending out mass messages. These messages often sound too good to be true. The content is usually to earn a big amount within a few days by working from home.\nThe scamming techniques\nBut the problem begins when firstly the task load seems difficult to complete within the allotted time period. Secondly, employers always take out maximum errors in the candidate’s work. Thus, making it extremely difficult to complete one’s task successfully. Which also happened in the case of Jasveer. Thirdly, the employers charge Rs 10,000 for utility and maintenance from the candidate. Though they promise to refund this amount in the succeeding month. Fourthly, the employers ask the candidate for their photo and digital signature. They then illegally use it on a contract of work between the employer and the candidate. Although, everything written on the contract was never communicated to the candidate in the first place. So candidates are left in the dark for what they are agreeing to.\nFor instance, in Jasveer’s case, the contract included that he would have to pay the utility charges monthly. It also said that if he was unable to complete his task within the given period, then he would be subjected to a penalty of Rs 10,000 by the employer for their loss. Inability to pay the penalty would result in a court case. Furthermore, withdrawing the court case would need a separate payment.\nTo scare the candidate further, they put a breach of contact on them under Section 73, 74 and 75 of the Indian Contract Act. The fake data entry jobs also call the candidates from pretending lawyers who ask them for money to withdraw their court case. The candidates would receive a no-objection certificate upon the payment. Then they will be free to go.\nLater, the employers reveal that the contract was actually for 11 months. So the candidate either has to work for the full term or pay the utility charges for the full term. In short, they do not let the candidate escape and keep harassing him for more money, as was the case with Jasveer.\nThe loopholes in the ongoing fake data entry jobs scam\nUpon consulting with Advocate Naman Mohnot on this situation, we got a clear idea of how the employers were trying to scam naive candidates. The two companies, Oval Solutions and Unitec Solutions, were harassing people with an Intent to Cheat. This means that the employer always wanted the candidate to fail and loot money from them maliciously. Thus, it could lead to a case of 420 on the employer. Intent to cheat was can verified due to the following reasons:\n•\tThe employer never asks the candidate for his ITR or bank records to check their paying capacity in the case of a penalty.\n•\tAn employer would never hire any candidate without interviewing them or any proof of their working capability. In Jasveer’s case, he was never interviewed. He was just given the job and promised a fixed amount.\n•\tOnline freelance websites never ask for money from candidates for incomplete tasks.\n•\tA company is eligible to ask for a refund from the candidate only when they invest in his training. Plus the candidate needs to have a signed bond with the company. But claiming for compensation without any investment on the candidate is a fraud.\n•\tA valid agreement or contract has to have the written signature of both parties. In Jasveer’s case, it was just an image of his signature. Additionally, two witnesses signatures are also compulsory on the agreement. This was lacking in Jasveer’s case too.\n•\tThere is also no notarization of the agreement or contract.\n•\tIt is also illegal to put multiple one-sided clauses in an agreement. Even if the other party signs the agreement, they are not held to fulfilling so many one-sided clauses.\n•\tThe employers also did not allow Jasveer additional days to check his work, even when his submission was before the due date. Thus the time duration given was invalid.\n•\tThere are also multiple and irrelevant calls from the company to scare candidates. There is no continuity in what they say either.\n•\tThe actual terms of the agreement are hidden on call before the candidate signs it, that too without his consent.\nHistory of these fake data entry jobs companies\nA quick Google search for Oval Solutions and Unitec Solutions leads one to the Consumer Complaints Forum. Here, multiple sources claim the scam they are facing from these fake data entry jobs. These fake data entry jobs firms are eligible to be sued under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. Filing an FIR against these companies is the ultimate answer.\n*******\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCould you please send the job offer/appontment letter so that I can check it and answer you.\nPlease contact.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI receive hundreds of such questions every month.

You need not worry about it and disconnect all connections with them. \nIs online data entry jobs are fake?\nit is totally scam people don't fall in to it they are not going to pay you anything they don't have proper company details or contact details you can not contact them for any issue after doing 5000rs work they will not pay..\n\nFake Data Entry Jobs To Beware Of\nHow does this fake data entry jobs racket operate?\nTwo companies, Oval Solution and Unitec Solution, get details of candidates from their online job websites profiles, such as Quikr. They offer the candidates to work from home opportunity. In Jasveer’s case, he was asked to write 120 pages by Unitec and type 10,000 captchas by Oval. Some employers even ask candidates to watch videos on YouTube. This work includes increasing video views. Jasveer was promised a remuneration of Rs 30,000 by Oval and Rs 25,200 by Unitec. Upon condition that he would complete his task within 12 days and with a 90% accuracy.\nThe scammers seem to be a full team of engineers, business developers and lawyers. They target people who have their resumes uploaded on job portals and are looking for work. They also lure people in by sending out mass messages. These messages often sound too good to be true. The content is usually to earn a big amount within a few days by working from home.\nThe scamming techniques\nBut the problem begins when firstly the task load seems difficult to complete within the allotted time period. Secondly, employers always take out maximum errors in the candidate’s work. Thus, making it extremely difficult to complete one’s task successfully. Which also happened in the case of Jasveer. Thirdly, the employers charge Rs 10,000 for utility and maintenance from the candidate. Though they promise to refund this amount in the succeeding month. Fourthly, the employers ask the candidate for their photo and digital signature. They then illegally use it on a contract of work between the employer and the candidate. Although, everything written on the contract was never communicated to the candidate in the first place. So candidates are left in the dark for what they are agreeing to.\nFor instance, in Jasveer’s case, the contract included that he would have to pay the utility charges monthly. It also said that if he was unable to complete his task within the given period, then he would be subjected to a penalty of Rs 10,000 by the employer for their loss. Inability to pay the penalty would result in a court case. Furthermore, withdrawing the court case would need a separate payment.\nTo scare the candidate further, they put a breach of contact on them under Section 73, 74 and 75 of the Indian Contract Act. The fake data entry jobs also call the candidates from pretending lawyers who ask them for money to withdraw their court case. The candidates would receive a no-objection certificate upon the payment. Then they will be free to go.\nLater, the employers reveal that the contract was actually for 11 months. So the candidate either has to work for the full term or pay the utility charges for the full term. In short, they do not let the candidate escape and keep harassing him for more money, as was the case with Jasveer.\nThe loopholes in the ongoing fake data entry jobs scam\nUpon consulting with Advocate Naman Mohnot on this situation, we got a clear idea of how the employers were trying to scam naive candidates. The two companies, Oval Solutions and Unitec Solutions, were harassing people with an Intent to Cheat. This means that the employer always wanted the candidate to fail and loot money from them maliciously. Thus, it could lead to a case of 420 on the employer. Intent to cheat was can verified due to the following reasons:\n•\tThe employer never asks the candidate for his ITR or bank records to check their paying capacity in the case of a penalty.\n•\tAn employer would never hire any candidate without interviewing them or any proof of their working capability. In Jasveer’s case, he was never interviewed. He was just given the job and promised a fixed amount.\n•\tOnline freelance websites never ask for money from candidates for incomplete tasks.\n•\tA company is eligible to ask for a refund from the candidate only when they invest in his training. Plus the candidate needs to have a signed bond with the company. But claiming for compensation without any investment on the candidate is a fraud.\n•\tA valid agreement or contract has to have the written signature of both parties. In Jasveer’s case, it was just an image of his signature. Additionally, two witnesses signatures are also compulsory on the agreement. This was lacking in Jasveer’s case too.\n•\tThere is also no notarization of the agreement or contract.\n•\tIt is also illegal to put multiple one-sided clauses in an agreement. Even if the other party signs the agreement, they are not held to fulfilling so many one-sided clauses.\n•\tThe employers also did not allow Jasveer additional days to check his work, even when his submission was before the due date. Thus the time duration given was invalid.\n•\tThere are also multiple and irrelevant calls from the company to scare candidates. There is no continuity in what they say either.\n•\tThe actual terms of the agreement are hidden on call before the candidate signs it, that too without his consent.\nHistory of these fake data entry jobs companies\nA quick Google search for Oval Solutions and Unitec Solutions leads one to the Consumer Complaints Forum. Here, multiple sources claim the scam they are facing from these fake data entry jobs. These fake data entry jobs firms are eligible to be sued under Sections 406 and 420 of the IPC. Filing an FIR against these companies is the ultimate answer.\n*******\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nI'm sorry to hear that you're going through this. It sounds like you've been the victim of a scam. You can send them a letter or email requesting a refund, explaining that you were misled into paying for services that you didn't receive. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, gives consumers the right to file a complaint against any company that has violated their rights. You can find more information about how to file a complaint on the NCDRC website. The Consumer Protection Act, 2019, prohibits unfair trade practices, such as misleading or deceptive advertising. \nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

As it's been more than 1 year and the case will not stand strong in court. \n\nDoes that mean working women can get abused and she will not Maintenace, and her life can be spoiled just because she is a educated working women and works day and night to lead life.\n\nI really wanted to teach my husband a lesson for spoiling my life.  \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour lawyer is incorrect as the law never differentiates between working and non working women in cases of physical abuse and domestic violence, though you won't be able to claim maintenance, but stil you can teach him a strong lesson.\nYou may contact me for professional consultation through call or whatsapp to discuss in detail \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFile dvc take maintenance in in dvc.dvc advocate will help u file dowry case against him and hisfamily\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nI'm sorry to hear about your situation. It sounds like you have been through a lot. The working woman can be eligible for interim maintenance in India, even if she is earning a monthly income. The amount of maintenance awarded will depend on the facts and circumstances of each case, But a working woman is not automatically ineligible for maintenance. The law does not specify a time limit for filing a 498A case. The court may take into account the delay in filing the case when deciding whether to grant relief. \nSection 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 Allows either spouse, including a working woman, to claim interim maintenance during the pendency of divorce proceedings.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour Advocate is wrong. If there is cruelty committed against you by husband and his relatives, you are entitled to file 498A and other cases for other offences committed against you. A working wife need not take any abuse just because she is working. No need to accept any abuse physical, mental, economic or social. You can keep your dignity intact. File cases for all offences committed against you. Seed guidance from me. Teach him and his relatives a lesson, he and they should not forget for life.

Given the friendly relationship between India and Nepal, many Nepalese nationals live and work in India under the framework of the India-Nepal Treaty of Peace and Friendship of 1950. However, living in India does not automatically grant one Indian citizenship.\n\nTo apply for Indian citizenship, here are the general steps and criteria:\n\nEligibility: As a foreign national, you can apply for Indian citizenship by Naturalization if you have resided in India during the last 12 months and for 11 out of the 14 years before the 12 months.\n\nApplication: You need to apply to the Ministry of Home Affairs on Form XII, as provided in the Third Schedule to the Citizenship Rules, 2009.\n\nDocumentation:\n\nProof of residence in India for the qualifying period.\nA good character certificate.\nKnowledge of any language in the Eighth Schedule to the Constitution.\nRenunciation of your Nepalese citizenship because India does not allow dual citizenship.\nOath of Allegiance: Once your application is approved, you need to take an Oath of Allegiance as a final step.\n\nSpecial Considerations for Nepalese Nationals:\n\nWhile the India-Nepal Treaty allows Nepalese citizens to reside and work in India without requiring a visa, this does not equate to citizenship. Therefore, the process of naturalization remains the primary route.\nRemember that acquiring Indian citizenship would mean giving up Nepalese citizenship, as neither country recognizes dual citizenship.\nConsultation: Always consult with an immigration lawyer in India for detailed guidance tailored to your specific situation. They can guide you through the process, assist with documentation, and help ensure that you meet all requirements.\n\nFurther Scrutiny: Applications for citizenship are carefully scrutinized, and it might be beneficial to have an advocate or a legal expert help you with the process.\n\nGiven the importance and complexity of such a decision and process, ensure you have all the facts, implications, and support you need before proceeding.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Only one official name can be used by a person at any point of time. There is no prohibitions on having any number of nicknames or aliases as long as only one official name is there on all documents.\n\nIf you have more than one name you are known by, you can decide which name to use for all official purposes. Once you select the name, you can affirm an affidavit before a First Class Magistrate stating that so-and-so and so-and-so are one and the same person, who for all official purposes shall be known as so-and-so.\n\nYes you can file a petition under divorce under cheating.  \n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCall and discuss the matter in details. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tAll are false  and fraud. click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes,\nYou can File cheating, misleading court complain against her in local police station. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tLegally and officially two names are not permitted.

I have proper authentic documents of my property. I am visiting courts and tehsil offices but no body solving my issue , can i solve my issue or should not expect anything. Previous 7/12 has proper information.The half area land of my property is being shown in my neighbour's 7/12, but on my 7/12 it is half the area than on  actual documents.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSorry to hear about your property issues. The 7/12 extract (also called \"Saath Baara Utara\" in Maharashtra) is an essential legal document associated with agricultural land that shows the ownership, area, and other details about the property. If there's a discrepancy in this document, it can lead to various legal and transactional issues.\n\nHere's what you can consider:\n\nHire a Lawyer: If you haven't already, consider hiring a lawyer who specializes in property matters. They can provide guidance on the necessary legal steps and represent you effectively in legal proceedings.\n\nDocumentation: Ensure that you have all original documents in place. These include purchase agreements, prior 7/12 extracts, tax receipts, and any other relevant documentation that shows the correct details of your property.\n\nRTI Application: You can file an RTI (Right to Information) application to seek information on how and why the changes in the 7/12 extract occurred. This can give you clarity on the series of events or mistakes that led to this discrepancy.\n\nLodging a Complaint: Submit a formal written complaint to the concerned Tehsil or Revenue Office explaining the discrepancies in detail. Make sure to attach copies (not originals) of all relevant documents as evidence.\n\nEngage with your Neighbour: Since the discrepancy also affects your neighbor's 7/12 extract, it might be worthwhile to have a dialogue with them. They might also be unaware of the discrepancy or may have noticed it. Addressing the issue collaboratively might be more effective.\n\nLegal Route: If all administrative remedies are exhausted and there's no resolution in sight, you may need to approach the courts to get an order to correct the 7/12 extract.\n\nLand Survey: Consider getting an official land survey done. A new, accurate survey of your property might help in establishing the correct area and boundaries of your land.\n\nStay Persistent: Property matters, especially in India, can often take time to resolve. Be patient and persistent. Engage regularly with the relevant officials and follow up on your complaints and applications.\n\nLastly, remember that accurate legal documentation is crucial for any property-related matters. It is always in your best interest to resolve such discrepancies as they can impact future transactions, inheritance, or any other legal claims related to the property.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI am forwarding online link  submit an application to talathi for correction in your 7/12 online.

    "headline": "Need advice in medical negligence case",
    "data": " \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI had filed a medical negligence case in 2005 in State Commission Mumbai which went till Supreme Court and was dismissed in 2015 without obtaining Expert Doctors opinion.\nIn 2016 i filed second time complaint in  NCDRC under fresh and continues cause of action and discovery of new facts with 4 doctors opinion from my side making Anaesthesiologist a new party in the case along with operating surgeon and hospital which was dismissed as not maintainable because I had made anaesthetist a party after 14 years, then I filed Civil Appeal in Supreme Court challenging NCDRC judgement, but due to Corona the hearing was done on video conferencing and due to technical reasons judge's could not understand the case properly and they dismissed the case. Then I filed Review Petition in Supreme Court against Civil Appeal dismissal which was heard in Chamber and then i filed Curative Petition which was also heard in Chamber and the same was dismissed.\nBoth the time none of the courts appointed an expert doctor panel to check the petitioner and medical records  and did not take doctors opinion before deciding the case.\nSo now can I file an SLP in Supreme Court or file 3rd time complaint in NCDRC under fresh and continues cause of action and ask for appointment of doctors panel?\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYour only option is to move writ petition to reopen the case on production of new evidences.\nSLP is not possible.\nYou may call or mail me through pathlegal for assistance, clarification and advice. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nThe only thing you can do is file a writ petition to have the case reopened upon the production of fresh evidence.\nSLP cannot be done.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou should rather discuss the entire issue with any lawyer and get the best suited legal advice in your case.\nThe courts, especially Higher Courts, usually don't dismiss the petition without any reason, or unless they find it meritless.\nSo, either your petition was wrongly drafted or your Advocate was too poor to defend your case.\nTherefore, you may, first of all, get your petition checked and then only plan to take further action.\nYou may contact me for professional consultation through call or whatsapp to discuss in detail.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can file a Special Leave Petition (SLP) in the Supreme Court against the dismissal of your Curative Petition. However, the Supreme Court will only grant an SLP if it finds that there is a prima facie case of medical negligence. You will need to provide the Supreme Court with strong evidence to support your case, such as medical records, expert reports, and witness statements.\nYou can also file a third complaint in the NCDRC under fresh and continues cause of action. However, the NCDRC is unlikely to appoint an expert doctor panel unless you can show that there is new evidence that was not available in your previous cases.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tbased on the sequence of legal actions you've described, there are a few important points to note:\n\nRes Judicata Principle: The principle of \"res judicata\" prevents the same parties from litigating on the same issue more than once. Since the Supreme Court, which is the highest court in the country, has already passed judgment on your matter (including the review and curative petitions), it may be challenging to bring the same cause of action before the court again.\n\nSpecial Leave Petition (SLP): An SLP in the Supreme Court is generally used to appeal against judgments from lower courts or tribunals. Given that you've already gone to the Supreme Court and had subsequent petitions dismissed, it would be critical to consult with legal counsel on the feasibility and rationale for filing an SLP.\n\nNCDRC Complaint: Filing a complaint for a third time under fresh and continued cause of action would require clear, distinct, and new grounds that haven't been presented before. Even then, the NCDRC might view the repeated petitions with caution, especially if there's significant overlap with prior complaints.\n\nAppointment of Doctor's Panel: The courts have discretionary powers regarding the appointment of expert panels or committees. While you can request this, it's not guaranteed. Courts might rely on available evidence and arguments presented before them.\n\nNew Legal Avenues: If there are genuinely new grounds or new evidence that wasn't available or considered in previous complaints, you might consider discussing with your legal counsel about how best to approach this. It might provide a new avenue for legal action.\n\nLegal Advice: Given the complexity of your case and the number of legal actions you've already undertaken, it's crucial to consult with a seasoned legal practitioner familiar with medical negligence cases in India. They can provide specific advice tailored to your situation and help you understand potential next steps, feasibility, and potential outcomes.\n\nLastly, it's essential to weigh the emotional, financial, and time investments against the potential outcomes, especially given the history of legal actions and their outcomes.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If your bail condition states that you should not engage in any act that is unlawful or could prejudice the proceedings, it's essential to consider whether your actions in raising complaints related to encroachments and illegal constructions could be interpreted as violating this condition.\nWhile raising complaints related to encroachments and illegal constructions may not necessarily be unlawful, it's crucial to ensure that your actions do not impede the ongoing legal proceedings or interfere with the evidence. If your complaints are pursued within the boundaries of the law and do not tamper with evidence or prejudice the court's proceedings, they might not be considered a violation of your bail conditions.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If the bank seizes the collateral and sells it, they may use the proceeds to offset the outstanding loan amount. If the sale doesn't cover the entire debt, you might still owe the remaining balance.\nRegarding attaching your property, in some cases, lenders might have the legal right to go after your other assets if the debt remains unpaid. This can vary based  the terms of your loan agreement, and the outcome of your arbitration.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir, When your car was stolen and FIR has been lodged then you should have asked the insurance company to give insured amount to you that money may be adjusted against loan and if you get that money .   bank should inform that  car is found and it should be restored to you but instead bank sold it without informing you which is not lawful, now till you not paid EMI before stolen car, bank may file recovery case in the court and can not attach any other property except recovery by court order.

However, the brother then sold the land to the second buyer in 1959, and the second buyer sold it to you in 1983.\nThe son of the original owner is arguing that the sale of the land to the second buyer and to you was invalid because the brother did not have the right to sell the land. He is also arguing that the sale of the land to you was invalid because you were not aware of the mistake in the plot number.\nYou will need to hire a lawyer to help you fight this case. The lawyer will be able to advise you on the best course of action and will represent you in court.\nIt is also important to remember that the police and government officials are not likely to be able to help you in this case. This is a civil matter, and the police and government officials are only involved in criminal matters.\nThe best way to protect your property is to file a case in court. This will force the son of the original owner to prove his claim. If he is unable to prove his claim, you will be awarded the land.\nI know that going to court is a daunting prospect, but it is the only way to protect your property.

Here are some general steps and methods that might be considered to try and establish the legality of the marriage in the context of a civil suit in India:\n\nPersonal Testimonies: Witnesses who were present during the marriage can provide testimony confirming the occurrence of the marriage. These could be friends, relatives, or neighbors who were present during the marriage ceremonies.\n\nPhotographs: Any photographs from the wedding ceremony could serve as circumstantial evidence of the marriage.\n\nRituals and Customs: Explaining the rituals and customs that were followed during the marriage and having witnesses testify about them can be useful, especially in the context of Hindu marriage, which has certain ceremonies like 'Saptapadi' (seven steps) which are considered crucial for the marriage.\n\nPresence of a Priest: If a priest officiated the marriage and he is still alive, his testimony can be pivotal. If not, records or any other evidence of his involvement could help.\n\nSubsequent Conduct: Evidence of the couple living together as husband and wife, having children, attending family or public events together, or any other social acknowledgment of their status as a married couple can serve as circumstantial evidence.\n\nFinancial and Property Records: Any joint property or financial transactions, bank accounts, or investments can serve as evidence of a marital relationship.\n\nInvitation Cards: If there were any invitation cards for the marriage, they could serve as evidence.\n\nAffidavits: In the absence of direct evidence, affidavits from close relatives or friends attesting to the fact of marriage can be presented.\n\nChildren's Birth Certificates: If the couple had children, their birth certificates showing the names of both the husband and wife can be an indirect proof of their marriage.\n\nAny Other Indirect Evidence: Any letters, documents, or communications between the couple or with others which indicate their status as husband and wife can be valuable.\n\nLack of Opposition: If no one contested or objected to the marriage at the time, that itself might be used as circumstantial evidence of its validity.\n\nRemember, given that this is a legal issue pertaining to a partition suit and the legitimacy of a marriage, it's crucial to work closely with a legal professional in India who can provide guidance tailored to your specific circumstances. Only a qualified lawyer can give legal advice on how best to present the evidence in court and address any legal challenges that might arise.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir, Step son should  challenge the legality of marriage of so call second wife of his father, The onus of burden lies upon the second wife  to Provel that she was married after the death of  first wife of your father lawfully as second wife  otherwise  failing to   prove she will be treated as illegal wife.Please like my advice\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

    "data": " \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tMy father filed a case in high court of Gujarat since 5 year on 2019 against state of Gujarat. He got more that 10 next listing dates. High court is not taking a case. This case is special civil case regarding pension issue. But every time they are giving new date. Please guide me further as we are lack of money \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIt's important to consult with a legal professional for advice tailored to your specific case.\n\nConsult Your Lawyer: If your father already has a lawyer, it's essential to communicate with them regularly. They can provide insights into the specific reasons behind the delays and suggest possible strategies to move the case forward.\n\nCheck for Delays: Sometimes, delays are inevitable due to the court's workload and various procedural requirements. Check with your lawyer if the case is genuinely stuck or if there are legitimate reasons for the delays.\n\nRequest for an Expedited Hearing: Given the nature of the case (pension issue), you could request the court to expedite the hearing based on the critical financial implications involved. Your lawyer can guide you on how to make such a request.\n\nMediation or Settlement: Depending on the circumstances, you might want to explore the possibility of mediation or reaching a settlement with the opposing party. This could potentially lead to a faster resolution and save both time and money.\n\nLegal Aid: If you're struggling financially, inquire about the availability of legal aid or pro bono services. These services might help you continue pursuing the case without incurring significant expenses.\n\nPetition for Progress Report: In some cases, you might be able to petition the court for a progress report on why the case is being delayed. This could potentially put pressure on the court to expedite the proceedings.\n\nCheck for Administrative or Procedural Issues: Sometimes, cases get delayed due to administrative or procedural issues. Make sure all necessary paperwork is in order and that there are no outstanding requirements on your end.\n\nContact the Court: If the case has been consistently delayed without a clear reason, you might consider contacting the court's administrative office to inquire about the status and any potential reasons for the delays.\n\nSeek Additional Legal Opinions: If you believe your current legal representation is not providing adequate assistance, you might consider seeking a second opinion from another lawyer. They might provide fresh insights or suggest alternative approaches.\n\nStay Persistent and Patient: Legal proceedings can be slow and frustrating, but it's important to remain patient and persistent. Continue to communicate with your lawyer, follow their guidance, and work towards a resolution.\n\nRemember that every legal case is unique, and the strategies that work will depend on the specifics of your situation.

This is often referred to as \"zero FIR\" or \"inter-state FIR.\" The concept of zero FIR allows the victim, or anyone with knowledge of the crime, to report the incident to any police station, regardless of the jurisdiction in which the crime occurred.\n\nThe primary purpose of zero FIR is to ensure that victims of crimes can promptly report incidents and initiate the legal process without being limited by geographical restrictions. The police station where the zero FIR is lodged then registers the complaint, conducts the initial investigation, and can subsequently transfer the case to the appropriate jurisdiction if necessary.\n\nHowever, laws and procedures may vary from one jurisdiction to another, so it's important to consult with legal experts familiar with the laws and regulations in the specific area where the incident occurred. If you're dealing with such a situation, it's advisable to contact a lawyer or legal professional who can provide accurate guidance based on the relevant laws in your region.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tUnder Section 179, if crime is committed at one place but consequences ensue at other place, complaint can be filed at such other place.

Even if the crime was not committed inside the boundaries of a specific jurisdiction, this is not a reason to forego filing the FIR. \nIn many jurisdictions, a First Information Report (FIR) pertaining to a crime against women may be filed at a police station away from the scene of the offence. This is frequently referred to as \"inter-state FIR\" or \"zero FIR.\" No matter whose jurisdiction the crime took place in, the notion of zero FIR enables the victim or anybody with knowledge of the incident to report the incident to any police station.\nZero FIR's main goal is to guarantee that victims of crimes can swiftly report occurrences and begin the legal process without being constrained by regional boundaries. The police station where the zero FIR is filed then files the complaint, opens an investigation, and, if necessary, can refer the case to the proper authority.\nBut since laws and procedures might differ from one jurisdiction to the next, it's crucial to speak with legal professionals versed with the rules and laws in the particular location where the occurrence took place. It is advised that you speak with a lawyer or other legal expert if you find yourself in such a predicament so that they can provide you precise advice based on the applicable laws in your area. \n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

If special leave is granted, the court will then proceed to hear the case on its merits.\n\nStay of Judgment: In some cases, the Supreme Court may consider staying the judgment of the lower court while the appeal is pending before it. However, the grant of a stay is not automatic and is usually considered based on factors such as the strength of the arguments, the potential harm to the parties, and the balance of convenience.\n\nMerits of the Case: If the Supreme Court decides to hear the appeal on its merits, it will consider the legal arguments presented by both parties. The court will analyze the facts, legal principles, and previous decisions to arrive at a decision.\n\nDecision: The Supreme Court can uphold the lower court's judgment, modify it, or reverse it. The court's decision will be based on its interpretation of the law and its assessment of the evidence presented.\n\nTimeline: The timeline for the Supreme Court proceedings can vary widely. It might take several months or even years for a case to be heard and decided, depending on the court's caseload and the complexity of the case.\n\nIt's important to note that the Supreme Court's decision to grant special leave, stay a judgment, or decide on the merits of the case is based on its evaluation of the legal issues involved.

It's possible that they could initiate legal action seeking damages or other remedies. This is why it's important to consult with a legal professional who can provide guidance based on the specifics of your case and the relevant laws.\n\nLegal Advice: Given the potential legal implications, it's strongly recommended that you consult with a lawyer who specializes in property transactions or contract law.

It's important to consult a legal expert in your jurisdiction for accurate information tailored to your situation.\n\nHere's some general information:\n\nBail Eligibility: Whether an offense is bailable or non-bailable depends on the specific drug-related laws in your jurisdiction. In many places, drug offenses can be considered non-bailable due to their potential impact on public safety and the seriousness of the charges. However, some offenses might still be bailable depending on the quantity of drugs involved and other factors. Consult your jurisdiction's drug-related laws or consult with a lawyer for accurate information.\n\nBail Application: If the offense is bailable, the accused can apply for bail. The time it takes to secure bail can vary widely. In some cases, the bail application might be heard shortly after it's filed, while in others, it might take longer due to court schedules, holidays, or other factors.\n\nFactors Considered for Bail: Courts typically consider factors such as the accused's criminal history, the seriousness of the offense, the strength of the evidence against them, and their ties to the community when deciding whether to grant bail. Consulting an experienced criminal defense lawyer is crucial to present the strongest possible case for bail.\n\nChoice of Advocate: Drug-related cases are serious criminal matters and should be handled by experienced criminal defense lawyers who specialize in handling drug cases or related offenses. Look for an advocate who has a proven track record in criminal defense and understands the nuances of drug-related laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nLegal Process: The legal process for securing bail involves submitting a bail application to the appropriate court. The court will review the application and the evidence before making a decision. Your lawyer will play a critical role in presenting a strong case for bail.\n\nDuration: The time it takes to secure bail can vary. In some cases, bail might be granted relatively quickly, while in others, it might take longer due to various factors like court schedules, holidays, and the complexity of the case.\n\nLegal Advice: It's important to consult a qualified criminal defense lawyer who specializes in drug-related cases. They can provide you with accurate advice based on the specific laws in your jurisdiction and the details of your case.\n\nIf you or someone you know is facing a drug-related case, it's highly recommended to consult a legal professional who can guide you through the legal process, provide advice on your specific situation, and ensure that your rights are protected throughout the proceedings.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nall the drug cases are non bailable \nthe bail is available or not depends on various factors\nengage an experienced advocate and he will take up the issue further\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nAlthough drug possession offences under the NDPS Act are not subject to bail, the court may nevertheless grant bail if the quantity of narcotics recovered falls within a certain range. It takes time to obtain bail in a drug-related case, and whether or not the offence is bailable might depend on a number of factors, including the particular laws of your jurisdiction, the evidence against the accused, the facts of the case, and the effectiveness of the legal system.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

To get accurate advice based on your specific circumstances and the laws of your jurisdiction, consult with a qualified attorney.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, when a person passes away without leaving a valid will, the laws of intestate succession come into play to determine how the deceased person's property will be distributed. These laws vary from place to place, but they often prioritize close family members in the distribution process.\n\nIf you were to pass away without a will, the distribution of your property would depend on the laws of your jurisdiction and your family's situation. In many cases:\n\nSpouse's Share: Your husband would likely have a legitimate claim to a portion of your property, as he is your legal spouse. The specific percentage he might inherit can vary based on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nChild's Share: Your minor daughter would typically have a right to inherit a share of your property as well. In many jurisdictions, her share might be held in trust until she reaches a certain age or a legal guardian is appointed to manage her interests. The specific percentage she might inherit can vary based on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nGuardianship: If you pass away and your daughter has no appointed guardian, the court might appoint a legal guardian to manage her interests until she becomes of legal age. This guardian would typically be responsible for managing her inheritance and making decisions on her behalf.\n\nDistribution Process: The distribution process can be complex and might involve legal procedures and court interventions. It's important to consult with a lawyer to ensure that your daughter's rights and interests are protected.\n\nWriting a Will: One way to have more control over the distribution of your property is to write a valid will. This allows you to specify how you want your assets to be distributed and who you want to serve as your daughter's guardian if needed.\n\nIt's crucial to consult with an attorney who is knowledgeable about the laws of your jurisdiction. They can provide you with accurate advice and help you make informed decisions about estate planning, guardianship, and property distribution to ensure that your wishes are followed and your loved ones are protected.\n\n\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear sister\n1. there is no right answer under the assumptions and presumtions\n2. it depends on the situation so drop the assumption that what when you will be leaving the world\n3. as per the law both will have 50%\n4. as it is property is yet to come\n5. raise the question when you get the property\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nNo both will get 50 percent of share.

You can take preventative measures to thwart your husband's attempts. \n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It provides legal protection and support to the victim. It's not just limited to physical violence but also includes emotional, sexual, and economic abuse. If you're subjected to any form of domestic violence, you can seek protection under this law.\n\nInfluence and Misuse of Power: While it is true that there are cases where individuals use their influence to bend the rules, it doesn't mean that justice cannot be served. It is crucial to find a trusted advocate or lawyer who can guide you through the legal process and ensure your rights are protected.\n\nSeek Legal Counsel: If you feel that your in-laws might use their influence against you, consult with an attorney about your situation. They can give you guidance on how to handle this.\n\nSupport Organizations: There are various NGOs and women's rights organizations in India that provide support and shelter to victims of domestic violence. Organizations like Women's Helpline, National Commission for Women, and various other local NGOs can assist and support you.\n\nGathering Evidence: If it's safe to do so, try to gather evidence of the threats and abuse you are facing. This might include voice recordings, text messages, photos, or any other evidence that might be used to support your claim in court.\n\nSafety First: Your safety is paramount. If you believe your life is in danger, try to find a safe place, such as a friend's or relative's house. Once you're in a safe environment, you can take further steps to address the situation.\n\nProperty Rights: Legally, no one can force you to transfer your property against your will. If your property is in your name, you have the legal right to it. If anyone is trying to force or pressurize you into signing over property or any other assets, it's essential to involve the authorities.\n\nWhile the challenges you face are undoubtedly significant, it's essential to know that there are laws in place to protect women from domestic violence in India. Seek assistance from trusted individuals, be it friends, relatives, or professionals.\n\nAgain, if you're in immediate danger, please contact the police or other appropriate authorities.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFile a police complaint in  the nearest police station.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes possible . if you consider your properties are different from family property  please file D V case you may succeed also but marriage is over . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tmadam as you did write to us the same way write complaint to the police department , CAW cell . no madam it is their insecurity greed and try to avoid the punishment from the court . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\n\nDon't worry no one can put you in jail without any gravious offence.

Then what should be the limitation period within which lender should reply before any recourse under Sec 13(4)?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe SARFAESI Act, 2002 (Securitization and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002) is an Indian law that allows banks and other financial institutions to recover their non-performing assets (NPAs) without the intervention of the court.\n\nAs per the act:\n\nSection 13(2): If a borrower defaults in repayment and the account is classified as a Non-Performing Asset (NPA), the secured creditor can issue a notice to the borrower asking them to discharge their liabilities within 60 days.\n\nSection 13(3A): If the borrower raises any objection or places any representation against the notice issued under Section 13(2), the secured creditor should consider such representation or objection and send a reply to the borrower within 15 days.\n\nThe provision does suggest that the creditor should reply within 15 days. However, if courts have interpreted this time frame as non-mandatory, then the explicit mandatory period is not binding. But even so, the bank or financial institution must act in a reasonable timeframe. What is considered \"reasonable\" may vary and often depends on the facts and circumstances of each case.\n\nSection 13(4): If the borrower fails to comply with the notice under Section 13(2), the creditor has the right to take possession of the assets, sell the assets, or take over the management of the business of the borrower.\nThere isn't a specific limitation period mentioned for lenders to reply before they proceed under Section 13(4). However, a lender should follow the procedures and timeframes laid down in the act to ensure that their actions are legally sound.\n\nIn any event, if you're dealing with an issue related to the SARFAESI Act, it would be prudent to consult with a legal professional in India who can provide detailed advice specific to your situation.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir what ever court says is more mandatory .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\n\nThe Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest (SARFAESI) Act, 2002, is an Indian law that empowers banks and financial institutions to take possession of and sell assets pledged as collateral by borrowers in the event of default. Section 13(3A) of the SARFAESI Act pertains to the right of the borrower to appeal against the action taken by the secured creditor (bank or financial institution) under Section 13(4).\n\nSection 13(3A) reads as follows:\n\n\"(3A) Any person (including borrower), aggrieved by any of the measures referred to in sub-section (4) of section 13 taken by the secured creditor or his authorised officer under this Act, may make an application along with such fee, as may be prescribed, to the Debts Recovery Tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter within forty-five days from the date on which such measures had been taken: Provided that different fees may be prescribed for making the application by the borrower and the person other than the borrower.\"\n\nThis section essentially grants the borrower the right to appeal against the actions taken by the secured creditor (usually a bank) under Section 13(4) of the SARFAESI Act. Section 13(4) deals with the measures that a secured creditor can take to recover their dues, including taking possession of the secured assets and selling them to recover the outstanding debt. If the borrower is aggrieved by such actions, they have the option to file an application with the Debts Recovery Tribunal (DRT) within forty-five days of the date on which the measures were taken. The appeal must be accompanied by the prescribed fee.\n\nIn the context of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (SARFAESI Act) of 2002, the specific time frame within which a lender should reply to the representation of a borrower under Section 13(2) might not be explicitly defined in the Act itself.\nHowever, the Act provides a mechanism for borrowers to make a representation against the measures taken by the lender under Section 13(2). The lender has the discretion to consider and reply to the borrower's representation. While there may not be a strict statutory time frame for the lender's response, it's generally advisable for lenders to reply within a reasonable time to ensure transparency and fair dealings.\nIf the lender fails to reply or the borrower is dissatisfied with the lender's response, the borrower can take recourse under Section 13(4) of the Act.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Here are some strategies you could consider to minimize or defer capital gains:\n\nRetirement of Partners: Instead of dissolving the firm, consider the retirement of partners. When a partner retires and takes his share of the capital asset, it might be considered a mere distribution of his share in the partnership. However, the interpretation and tax implications may vary, and the tax treatment might be disputed by the tax authorities. You'll need to ensure that the transaction is structured correctly and in accordance with the partnership deed.\n\nRevaluation of Assets: Revalue the assets of the partnership before the distribution. This might increase the book value of the asset, which could potentially reduce the capital gains that arise at the time of distribution.\n\nInvesting in Specific Bonds: If there's still a capital gain, you can consider investing the capital gains in specified bonds under Section 54EC of the Income Tax Act. These bonds have a lock-in period of 5 years and can help save taxes on the capital gains.\n\nInvesting in a New Property: Depending on the nature of the asset, if it's a real estate property, you might qualify for exemptions under Section 54 or Section 54F by reinvesting the capital gains in a new residential property.\n\nGift or Will: A more long-term approach might be to consider gifting the property or bequeathing it via a will, as gifts are generally not considered a 'transfer' for capital gains purposes. However, remember that there could be other implications like stamp duty.\n\nHolding Period: If the properties are close to completing a holding period that will make them long-term capital assets (typically more than 24 months for property), it might be beneficial to wait. Long-term capital gains have more beneficial provisions for tax than short-term capital gains.\n\nTransfer to an LLP: Another approach might be converting the partnership firm into an LLP (Limited Liability Partnership) and then distribute the assets. However, this has its own set of conditions and might not necessarily save you from capital gains tax, but could provide more flexibility.\n\nLastly, it's essential to work closely with a tax consultant or a chartered accountant familiar with such transactions. They will help structure the distribution in a manner most beneficial and compliant with the law. Given that tax laws and interpretations can be complex, professional guidance will ensure you take the right steps.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In the context of partnership firms in India, the distribution of assets or properties to its partners can potentially lead to capital gains tax implications. Here are some methods you might consider to reduce or avoid the impact of capital gains:\n\nRetirement of Partners: The retirement of a partner and taking his share in the capital asset could be considered as mere distribution of his share in the partnership, rather than a 'transfer' for the purposes of capital gains. However, this is a complex area, and the tax treatment might be disputed by the tax authorities. You'll need to structure this carefully and in line with the partnership deed.\n\nRevaluation of Assets: Before the distribution, consider revaluing the assets of the partnership. By doing so, you can potentially increase the book value of the asset, which could, in turn, reduce the capital gains that arise at the time of distribution.\n\nContinue the Partnership Firm with Adjusted Capital Contribution: If the objective is just to distribute the properties and not dissolve the firm, you could re-adjust the capital contributions of the partners. By doing so, the property could stand in the name of the partners to whom they are supposed to be transferred, and the capital of the other partners could be adjusted accordingly.\n\nInvestment in Specified Bonds: If capital gains still arise, consider investing the gains in specified bonds under Section 54EC of the Income Tax Act. This can help in getting an exemption on the capital gains, provided the gains are invested within 6 months of transfer.\n\nConversion to LLP: Converting the partnership into a Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) could be an option. While the transfer of a capital asset to an LLP does not attract capital gains tax, the subsequent distribution to partners might. It's essential to understand the tax implications fully before taking this route.\n\nHolding Period: Capital assets that are held for more than 24 months (for immovable properties) are classified as long-term and attract a more favorable rate of capital gains tax. If your properties are nearing this timeline, it might make sense to hold off the distribution until they become long-term assets.\n\nFamily Settlement: Given that this is arising out of an internal family settlement, it may be argued that there is no 'transfer' in the eyes of law and hence no capital gains. However, this area is grey, and tax authorities might dispute it. Proper documentation of the family settlement is crucial.\n\nIt's imperative to consult with a chartered accountant or a tax lawyer who can guide you based on the detailed facts of your case. The strategies listed above are general in nature, and the best approach would depend on your specific circumstances and the latest judicial precedents.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

They will provide you with advice and guidance specific to your situation and jurisdiction. Both spouses must agree to seek a divorce and be willing to cooperate throughout the process. In a mutual consent divorce, both parties agree that the marriage has irretrievably broken down and they wish to end the marriage. Some jurisdictions require a mandatory separation period before filing for divorce. During this time, you and your spouse may need to live separately for a specified period of time. The duration of this separation period can vary depending on local laws. Your attorney will help you draft a joint petition for divorce. This document outlines the terms of your agreement, including issues such as property division, child custody, child support, alimony (if applicable), and any other relevant matters.\nBoth parties will need to provide complete financial disclosures, including assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. This is essential for an equitable division of assets and to determine any spousal or child support obligations. If there are any disagreements or complex issues, negotiations between the spouses or their attorneys will take place to reach an agreement on all terms. Once all terms are agreed upon, a settlement agreement is drafted. This document outlines the terms and conditions of the divorce, covering property division, custody arrangements, child support, alimony, and any other relevant matters. The joint petition for divorce, along with the settlement agreement, is filed with the appropriate court in your jurisdiction. Filing fees and required documents may vary based on your location. In some cases, both parties may need to appear in court for a brief hearing. This is usually a formality to ensure that both parties are entering the divorce voluntarily and understand the terms of the settlement agreement. Once the court is satisfied with the terms and all legal requirements are met, a final divorce decree will be issued. This legally terminates the marriage.\n\nThe Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 enshrines the right to divorce by way of mutual consent under Section 13B. The spouses can jointly file a petition seeking divorce under Section 13B before the family court, which possesses the jurisdiction to pass such a decree of divorce under Section 13B.\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Madam,\nYou may immediately go for mutual divorce and it may not happened without a lawyer. \n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

For mutual consent divorce you both should have lived separately away from each other for a period of more than a year. Out of court divorce is not legally valid.\nAs per the Hindu Marriage Act petition for divorce can be allowed only after one year, before also you can file, but it is the discretion of the Court to allow the petition or not. After allowing the petition, time will take to grant divorce 6 months min. and max 7 months.\nSection 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, provides for the circumstances in which either of the spouses can opt for divorce. It is important to note that, as enumerated in Section 14, parties cannot file a petition for divorce within one year of their marriage.\n\nThank You\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, it is possible to get a divorce before one year of marriage in India, but only under certain circumstances.\nUnder Section 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955, a husband or wife can seek divorce on the grounds of cruelty, desertion, or insanity. However, in order to get a divorce on the grounds of cruelty, the cruelty must have been such that it would be impossible for the parties to live together. In the case of desertion, the spouse must have deserted the other spouse for a continuous period of at least two years. And in the case of insanity, the spouse must have been of unsound mind for a continuous period of at least two years.\nIf the parties are able to prove one of these grounds, then they can file a petition for divorce in the family court. The court will then decide whether to grant the divorce or not.\nThe time it takes to get a final divorce decree will vary depending on the case. However, it is generally a lengthy process, and it can take several months or even years to get a final decree.\n\nAdv.

In the past few years there have been many such instances, to showcase an example, an 81-year-old woman was seriously threatened by recovery agents, she got 375 threatening calls concerning her child's unpaid bank dues. After that, she moved to the police, and a case was filed against these agents. Another incident quoted as per media reports stated that a private bus was halted, and 42 travellers were held hostage for three hours by recovery agents, who needed to recover money from the travel company that owned the bus. These cases affirm that recovery agents/offices are feared in India.   A recovery agent seeks clients and organizations that owe instalments to banks. Many of these recovery agents collect the banks'clientspayment dues for a charge or a percentage of the total amount owed. These agents are generally a third-party\n\nhttps://www.legalserviceindia.com/legal/article-4865-remedies-against-harassment-by-recovery-agents.html\n\nYou may get issue a strong legal notice from my office or file a Suit for Permanent Injunction against Recovery Agents and Bankers. \n\n ICCI Bank Limited vs. Prakash Kaur case,\n\nThe Supreme Court in a landmark judgement  reiterated its earlier stand that banks cannot deploy musclemen for recovery of loans from defaulters thus forcing them to end their lives.\n     \n\"We deem it appropriate to remind the banks and other financial institutions that we live in a civilised country and are governed by the rule of law,\" a bench comprising Justices Tarun Chatterjee and Dalveer Bhandari said.\n     \nThe court while dismissing the ICICI Bank's plea refused to delete the Delhi High Court's remarks that held the bank and its musclemen responsible for abetting a youth to commit suicide by humiliating him and taking away his motorcycle financed by the largest private sector bank.\n     \nIt also asked the ICICI Bank to to pay Rs 25,000 as cost of this litigation to the respondents within three weeks and directed the Delhi Police to conclude the investigation against the bank expeditiously within three months, keeping in view the gravity of the allegations.\n     \nThe court also directed the concerned Deputy Commissioner of Police to submit the investigation report in the Delhi High Court.\n     \nAccording to the court, complaints received by Reserve Bank regarding violation of the above guidelines and adoption of abusive practices followed by banks recovery agents would be viewed seriously.\n     \nReiterating the RBI Guidelines on Engagement of Recovery Agents, the court said, \"The Reserve Bank may consider imposing a ban on a bank from engaging recovery agents in a particular area, either jurisdictional or functional, for a limited period. In case of persistent breach of above guidelines, Reserve Bank may consider extending the period of ban or the area of ban.\"\n     \n\"RBI had expressed its concern about the number of litigations filed against the banks in the recent past for engaging recovery agents who have purportedly violated the law,\" Justice Bhandari, writing the verdict for the bench, stated.\n     \nRBI in a letter accompanying its April 24, 2008 Guidelines had stated that it might consider imposing a ban on a bank from engaging recovery agents in a particular area, either jurisdictional or functional, for a limited period.\n     \nICICI Bank had moved the apex court seeking deletion of some paragraphs in the High Court order which had said that \"...the proximate cause of death of the deceased that led him to commit suicide was on account of humiliation caused by the Bank people from where loan was taken by him.\"\n     \n\"The modus-operandi employed by the banks like ICICI for realisation of their loan amount and for recovering the possession of the vehicle against which loans are given is extra legal and by no stretch of imagination they can be permitted to employ musclemen and goons for recovery of their dues even from a defaulting party,\" the High Court had observed.\n     \nThe High Court order had come on a petition filed by Shanti Devi Sharma, the deceased's mother, seeking a probe against the ICICI bank and its staff for the unlawful action, which led to the suicide of her 34-year old son Himanshu Dev Sharma.\n     \nSharma had committed suicide in October 2005 by hanging himself at his house after he was allegedly intimidated and humiliated in front of his neighbours and family by recovery agents employed by the bank for recovering the loan amount taken for his motorcycle.\n     \nThe ICICI Bank had contended that it was within its rights to recover loans and had followed the required procedure for recovering dues.\nKeep these rules in mind while facing a loan recovery agent\nKnow the facts\nBanks may have an in-house collection department or they may outsource the job to a third-party collection agency. Keep in mind that no bank likes non-performing assets, or bad debts, on their balance sheet. A debt becomes bad when it’s not paid for three consecutive months.\n“Usually if the debt is unpaid for a month, the collection team sends reminders or calls up the customer for recovery. However, the delay in payment could just be an oversight on the borrower’s part,” said a senior banker with a private sector bank, who did not want to be named. “But when the debt becomes 90 days overdue, we initiate recovery agent visits.”\nThis, however, depends on a bank’s policy.\nIn case you are unable to repay on time, it’s best to tell the bank about your situation. If you have a genuine reason, the bank may be willing to work towards a solution. This also depends on the bank’s policy.\n“A credit card debt can be easily converted into an EMI instead of total loan outstanding amount,” said the senior banker cited above. “The bank may even restructure a loan in some cases. Of course, this also depends on your past payment record.”\nHandling agents\nKeep in mind that at times recovery agents have big targets to achieve and may also have incentives linked to the number and volume of collection. So they are a motivated lot and handling them isn’t easy.\nKnow the rules: You, as a debtor, have certain rights. Knowing those rights will help you handle a recovery agent.\nIdentity: You can ask the recover agents to show their identity cards issued by the bank or under the authority of the bank.\nPrivacy: You have a right to privacy. The recovery agent cannot discuss the debt to another person. So don’t panic if he threatens to tell neighbours or co-workers about your debt. If he does so, you can file a complaint against him with the bank.\nTime: The recovery agent should contact you between 7am and 7pm. However, if your working hours or work shift does not permit this, you may be contacted beyond this time limit.\nCalls: You can choose the place and time for receiving recovery calls. You can also request them to not call you at a particular place or time. For instance, if you don’t want to receive calls at work, specify the same to the agent or the bank. Keep in mind, they will respect your request only till they feel you are not avoiding them.\nDecency: The recovery agent has to talk to you in a decent and civilized manner. No abusive language should be used. Also, the written communication sent by the banks should be easy to understand.\nInvestigation: If you file a complaint against a recovery agent, the bank needs to investigate the matter. This makes recovery agents accountable for their collection practice.\nInappropriate occasions: If there is a death in your family or any such event, you can tell the agent not to call you or make visits for a few days.\nRecords: Banks document the content of conversations between customers and agents along with the time and number of calls. Banks also need to keep all copies of communications sent to customers.\nDisputes: If you face any dispute or differences regarding dues, seek assistance of the lender.\nSeeking help\nThere could be various reasons for you not being able to pay instalments on time— medical conditions, job loss or a twin-income family becoming a single-income household. Macroeconomic factors such as high inflation or rising interest rates, too, can be the reasons. If the reason for non-payment is not temporary, it’s best is to approach credit counselling agencies and seek help. “We provide free credit counselling for those who are struggling to get out of debt,” said Narayanan Raja, chief executive, BCSBI.\nDebt counselling agencies such as Abhay and Disha also offer such services for free. If you are uncomfortable going to these centres, you can avail counselling over telephone which also is provided without any cost.\nRecourse if harassed\nIf you think the agent is not following any of the above mentioned rules, you should file a complaint. Raja said, “If a borrower thinks he is being harassed, he should first approach the bank, and if not satisfied by its response, he should get in touch with the banking ombudsman.”\nThough rules have been laid down to assist borrowers, it is best to rework household budget and make provisions to accommodate the unseen change in the repayment amount.\nThe bank can sue you on defaulting the credit card payment. It cannot amount to criminal liability as it would be considered as non payment of loan which will constitute as a civil act by nature.\nThe Banks and Financial Institutions can lend money even without security, normally, the Banks and Financial Institutions insist for security for the repayment of loan. The fixed assets, receivables etc. can be securities acceptable to the Banks and Financial Institutions for sanctioning the loans. The loan entitlements, the procedure for sanctioning the loan, the security issues etc, are exclusively governed by the guidelines/norms issued by the Reserve Bank of India.\nLoan being an agreement or understanding between the Bank and the borrower, the general laws like Law of Contract, Transfer of Property Act, Specific Relief Act, Specific Performance etc., are applicable to all banking transactions depending upon the nature of transaction. When a borrower fails to repay the money to the Bank, what the Bank can do for recovering the loan is to file a civil suit earlier.\nin India the remedy available to lenders has been to file an ordinary money suit for recovery against the defaulting borrower for the outstanding amounts or to file a summary suit as provided for under Order 37 of Code of Civil Procedure 1908\nRBI CIRCULARS  LINK - Recovery Agents engaged by Banks\nhttps://www.rbi.org.in/CommonPerson/english/scripts/Notification.aspx?Id=347\nComplaints against the bank / its recovery agents\n3. Banks, as principals, are responsible for the actions of their agents. Hence, they should ensure that their agents engaged for recovery of their dues should strictly adhere to the above guidelines and instructions, including the BCSBI Code, while engaged in the process of recovery of dues.\n4. Complaints received by Reserve Bank regarding violation of the above guidelines and adoption of abusive practices followed by banks’ recovery agents would be viewed seriously. Reserve Bank may consider imposing a ban on a bank from engaging recovery agents in a particular area, either jurisdictional or functional, for a limited period.

This is a violation of the SARFAESI Act. You can approach the DRT and challenge the bank's action. You can also file a writ petition in the High Court.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\nyes you are clearly knowing and telling everything\nif you dont repay they will proceed for the symbolic possession\neven then if you dont repay they will proceed for the actual possession\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nYou are correct that the secured creditor is required to reply to the representation of the borrower against the 13(2) notice within 15 days from the date of service of the notice. This is mandated by Section 13(3A) of the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act, 2002 (SARFAESI Act).  In your case, the bank has not replied to your representation within 15 days. You can therefore approach the DRT for relief. The DRT can order the bank to reply to your representation and to consider it in good faith.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The IT Act also allows the police to compel the service provider to disclose the identity of the person who submitted the anonymous tip.  The time it takes for the Rajasthan police to preliminarily investigate a tip related to a sextortion racket depends on a number of factors, such as the nature of the tip, the availability of resources, and the workload of the police.

In your case you have been discriminated by your religion so your fundamental right has been violated so you can appeal before the court of law. \nSince you have been harassed by your religion Section 295A of the Indian Penal Code lays down the punishment for the deliberate and malicious acts, that are intended to outrage religious feelings of any class by insulting its religion or religious beliefs.

My mother faced breathing issue in tension. So this incident happened in May. We shifted to new home in May.\n\nBut this is August now. The owner has not returned back advance.\n\nWhen I asked him he is saying that he will not return money until some new tennant will come\n\nHe says in agreement it is mentioned 3 months before only I should inform him if I'm going to vacate.\n\nHe says he will deduct 3 months rent now. \n\nBut he is not going to give advance until another Tennant arrives.\n\nI have made an audio clip file of the fight that happened in our house with the neighbour. 2 years ago also a fight happened with another neighbour\n\nThing is that these neighbours are all living in our compound and same gate. Because they are tennants of our owners relatives\n\nThey always created issue for even small things.\n\nThis time they came to home saying my mother said something and they were fighting with us.\n\nThey were shouting and yelling.\n\nHow can I now get the advance back from this owner.\n\nWe actual locked home for 10 days after the incident and went away. And then shifted to new home. We informed owner only after shifting to new home\n\nI'm wondering is owner correct in saying he will deduct 3 months rent? Is he current in saying that he will not advance until new one comes\n\nBecause already now close to 3 months has gone since we shifted to new home\n\nHe is also saying some ashada is there so nobody will come and he won't give mone until new tennant comes to his come\n\nHow should I get advance back sooner from this person?\n\nHe also threatened me once saying he will come with lawyer and all\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHi .. don’t worry send him a legal notice through advocate stating ur facts and if if they don’t refund amount go for recovery of money case ..court is grant order in tenant favour .one similar case I got order in my favour with interest .

It sounds like you have a valid reason for leaving the property, and the landlord is not being reasonable in his demands.  To get the advance back you need to check your lease agreement, See if there is anything in the agreement that says you are required to give the landlord 3 months' notice before you vacate the property. If there is no such clause, then the landlord is not entitled to deduct 3 months' rent from your advance. If the landlord does not pay you, You can file a lawsuit in the Small Claims Court, which is a less expensive and less formal way to resolve disputes.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfile recovery suit . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tHave u vacated fullu or not of not don't vacate of vacated give legal notice and file police complaint against owner\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

This is because the Bl&lro records are the official records of land ownership in West Bengal. If the Bl&lro records do not show that you are the owner of the land, then you may not be able to sell the land or mortgage it. You have been trying to get the Bl&lro records changed for the past 10 years, but they have not been successful. This is a frustrating situation. You can try to contact the Bl&lro office and speak to someone about your case. Explain that you have a FHTD in your name and that you have been trying to get the records changed for the past 10 years. Ask them what else you need to do to get the records changed. If you are not able to get the Bl&lro records changed, you may need to file a lawsuit.\nThank You.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The disposal of the goods is your responsibility as the landlord. You can file a petition for permanent eviction and collect the rent till he evicts the house and by court's order you may dispose off the goods.\nHope this advice would really helpful to you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The family tree is required in order to transfer the khata (land record) to the beneficiaries named in the will. Without the Aadhaar card, it will be difficult to prove that your uncle's wife is a member of the family. If your family member refuses to give Aadhaar card you may file a petition in the court of law.\nHope this advice would be really helpful to you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir,\nYou have two options you may get issue a legal notice or go to the Police or approach Civil Court and get mandatory injunction order. \n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

The buyer's request to sign Form 29 and 30 and make a contract on a court paper is a good start, but it is not enough. The ownership of the scooter will not be transferred until the buyer has submitted the relevant documents to the RTO and the RTO has issued a new registration certificate in his name. If you give the buyer your scooter before the ownership has been transferred, you will still be responsible for any fines or penalties that the buyer incurs while driving the scooter. You will also be liable if the buyer is involved in an accident.\nHope this advice would be really helpful to you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tit is invalid . court has no role in this , you need to contact RTO only , in person . never trust on any person like the same .who is he to transfer the owner ship as when you are the owner and RTO is there for the same . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

    "headline": "Can I file criminal defamation against Investigating Officer",
    "data": " \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSir,\n\nIn the year 2021, our neighbour filed an application U/S 156(3) Cr.P.C against me and my mother which was absolutely false and as per the direction of the ACJM, concerned Police Station registered an F.I.R against us U/S 323,354,379, 506,120(B), 34 IPC. Thereafter, we voluntarily surrendered before the ACJM Court with a prayer for bail and our bail was allowed. Subsequently, Charge-Sheet was filed U/S 323,354,506,34 IPC. We perused the application U/S 156(3) wherein it was stated by our neighbour that the alleged incident took place on 05.05.2021 and it was also stated therein that she lodged a complaint before the concerned Police Station by Post on the basis of the said alleged incident date but police did not take action. \n\nSubsequently, we filed RTI application before the concerned police department, seeking certified copy of her police complaint which was lodged prior to filing 156(3) and finally we got the copy of such police complaint. After perusal of such police complaint, we got extremely surprised and shocked that the De-facto complainant in that police complaint stated that the alleged incident took place on 02.06.2023. The alleged incident date in the application U/S 156(3) and police complaint are absolutely different. \n\nImmediately thereafter, we filed an application before the ACJM Court, seeking discharge from this case as it was absolutely false and fictitious. Notice was served upon De-facto to attend the hearing of discharge application but on the date of hearing, she did not attend. The ACJM heard our submission and the Public Prosecutor and finally on 04.07.2023 the ACJM has been pleased to pass the final order, discharging us from this case. The observations made that the charges are groundless and no prima facie case is made out against us. \n\nNow I would like to know that since we have been discharged from this case, so, can I file criminal defamation case against the De-facto complainant i.e. our neighbour for our false implication in this case ? and can I also file it against the Investigating Officer who did not investigate the case in a proper and fair manner and using his legal power two innocent persons were put in the Charge-Sheet. \n\nSome Ld. Lawyers have told me that I can proceed against the De-facto complainant only by filing criminal defamation but not against the Investigating Officer. So, is it true that I can take action against the De-facto only ? is there no remedy to take action against the Investigating Officer, for whom we were implicated in this case unnecessarily since a long-time. Please tell me the remedy. \n\n\nThank You. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes, you can file a criminal defamation case against the de facto complainant for falsely implicating you in a criminal case. You can also file a complaint against the investigating officer for not conducting a fair investigation and causing you unnecessary harassment.\nThe remedy for action against the investigating officer would depend on the specific facts of your case. You may be able to file a complaint with the police or the State Human Rights Commission. You may also be able to file a civil suit for damages.\nIt is important to consult with a lawyer to discuss your specific case and to get advice on the best course of action.\n\nHere are some of the laws that you may be able to rely on to file a case against the de facto complainant and the investigating officer:\n\nSection 499 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC) - Defamation\nSection 196 of the IPC - Giving false information to a public servant with intent to cause injury\nSection 211 of the IPC - False charge of an offence\nSection 154 of the Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) - Power of police to investigate\nSection 177 of the CrPC - Duties of investigating officer\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou can proceed against complainant only, not against police.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir file the case at the DJ court , the lawyer must be in fear for the police , but for sure to file case on the police you need to have very strong evidence . just saying that the police did not investigate the case would do no good .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\n1. this is a negligible mistake committed by the defacto complainant \n2. so no criminal defamation arises out of this\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This is a very frustrating situation, and I can understand your concern.\nHere are some things you can do:\nSend a legal notice to the builder. This is a formal letter that will put the builder on notice that you are not happy with the delay. The letter should state the date of the agreed possession, the amount of money you have paid, and the reasons why you are not happy with the delay.\nFile a complaint with the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA). RERA is a government body that was set up to regulate the real estate sector. They can help you resolve disputes with builders.\nFile a case in court. This is a last resort, but it may be necessary if the builder is not willing to cooperate.\nIf you decide to file a case in court, you will need to gather evidence to support your claim. This includes the sale agreement, the legal notice, and any other documentation that shows the delay in possession.\nYou should also be aware of the time limits for filing a case. In most cases, you will need to file a case within three years of the date of the breach.\n\nAdv.

The letter should include the agreed-upon date of possession, the amount of money you have paid, and your complaints about the delay.\nInform the Real Estate Regulatory Authority (RERA) of your grievance. RERA is a governmental organisation that was established to control the real estate industry. They can assist you in settling issues with contractors.\nMake a court case. This is a last resort, but if the builder is unwilling to assist, it might be required.\nYou will require evidence to back up your claim if you choose to present a case in court.

And its time i want to leave. \nBut before i put in papers there is rather something that can be an issue. I have a bond here of 3 years or pay 5 lakhs. \nWhich i wont. And am not capable of currently. \nPrior to me there has been an employee for whom the company has waived the bond. Giving her the reason that it was only valid for the year. \n\nAlthough there are many discrepancies in the bond itself. Company has not given me any special training. The training i got is same as everyone else. Who everyone gets. Plus all the technologies they have mentioned that we will be trained on is incorrect and we havent been trained on that. \n\nCan you pls show me a way to get out of this, cause i am mentally suffering.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNegotiate with the company. Explain your situation to your manager and HR department, and see if they are willing to waive the bond. You may be able to negotiate a settlement, such as paying a smaller amount of money or agreeing to work for the company for a shorter period of time.\nChallenge the bond in court. If you believe that the bond is invalid, you can challenge it in court. You will need to prove that the bond is unreasonable or that it violates your rights.\nWait out the bond period. If you are not able to negotiate with the company or challenge the bond, you can simply wait out the bond period. Once the bond period is over, you will be free to leave the company without any penalty.\nIn your case, it sounds like you have a good case for challenging the bond. The fact that the company has waived the bond for other employees, and that the training you received was not as described in the bond, are both strong arguments in your favor. You may also be able to argue that the bond is unreasonable because it is for a period of three years, which is longer than the industry standard.\nIf you decide to challenge the bond, you should speak to an attorney who specializes in labor law. They will be able to help you assess your case and determine the best course of action.\n\nAdv.

Ask your manager and the HR division if they would be prepared to waive the bond after you have explained your position to them. You might be able to come to an agreement with the corporation, perhaps by offering to pay less or working there for less time.\nIn court, contest the surety bond. You can contest the bond in court if you think it is invalid. You'll have to provide evidence to support your claims that the bond is excessive or violates your rights.\nLet the bond period expire. You can just wait out the bond time if you are unable to negotiate with the corporation or refute the bond. You will be free to exit the company without incurring any fees after the bond time is over.\nYou appear to have a solid case for disputing the bond in this instance. Both the fact that the business has waived the bond for other workers and the fact that the training you received did not match the bond's description are powerful considerations in your favour. The bond's three-year duration, which is longer than the industry norm, may help support your claim that it is unfair.\nIf you choose to contest the bond, you should consult with a lawyer who focuses in labour law. They'll be able to assist you in evaluating your situation and choosing the best line of action.\n\nThank You\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDon't get mentally suffer, go to labour court complaint,there  labour commissioner.or contact me \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFirst, one need to look into the surety bond and the employment contract, if any.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Arrest is when you are taken into custody by the police and detained. In your case, you were simply detained at the police station for a short period of time, and then released after signing a personal surety bond.\nA personal surety bond is a document that you sign that promises to appear in court if required. It is a form of bail, and it allows you to be released from police custody without having to pay any money.\nThe fact that you were released after signing a personal surety bond means that the police did not consider you to be a flight risk. They believe that you are likely to appear in court when required.\nIt is possible that an FIR was registered in your case, but it is also possible that it was not. If an FIR was registered, the police will have to investigate the matter and then file a charge sheet in court. However, if the police do not consider your case to be serious, they may decide not to file a charge sheet.\nIf you have not heard anything from the police or the court in three months, it is possible that the case against you has been dropped. However, you should not assume this is the case. You should contact the police station where you were detained and ask for an update on your case.\nIn the meantime, you should keep a copy of the personal surety bond that you signed.

When you are detained by the police after being taken into custody, that is an arrest. You were just briefly detained at the police station in your instance, and following the execution of a personal surety bond, you were allowed to leave.\nA personal surety bond is a contract you sign pledging to show up in court if necessary. It functions as a type of bail and enables you to leave police custody without having to pay any cash.\nYou were freed following the execution of a personal surety bond, which proves that the police did not believe you posed a flight risk. They think you'll probably show up in court when it's necessary.\nIn your case, a FIR might have been filed, but it's also possible that it wasn't. The police must conduct an investigation if a FIR was filed before submitting a charge sheet to the court. However, the police could decide not to file a charge sheet if they don't think your case is serious.\nIt's possible that the case against you has been withdrawn if you haven't heard anything from the police or the court in three months. You shouldn't, however, presume that this is the case. Ask for an update on your case by contacting the police station where you were held.\nYou must preserve a copy of the personal surety bond you completed until then. If you ever find yourself in court, this paper will be crucial.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Does the grandson own the right to the property?\nAll property's owned by a Hindu person devolves onto his class one legal heir's. \n\nNow to the specific scenario's in ur example (for sake of convenience I'm presuming your grandfather has only one legal heir)\n\nSenario1: The property is self acquired by your Grandfather, in such case upon his demise intestate (without a will) the property would devolve upon ur Father and not you. In case your father passes away before your grandfather then in such case it would devolve upon you, your mother and ur siblings equally.\n\nScenario 2: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather father ( ur great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.\n\nScenario 3: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfather grand father ( ur great great grand farther) - would devolve same as scenario 1.\n\nScenario 4: the property in question is self acquired by ur grandfathers great grand father ( ur great great great grand farther) - then in such a case you would be entitled to the property by birth as it becomes ur ancestral property.\n\nTo give you more clarity on the concept of Ancestral Property's : any property which passes undivided down 4 generations of male lineage is called ancestral property. The right to such property acquires at birth unlike other laws of inheritance where right arises upon the death of the the owner.\n\nHope this brings some clarity to your question and your sense of entitlements.\nMeaning of ancestral property  in India-An ancestral property means a propertywhich is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father's fatheror father's fathers' father. ... That means when a coparcener acquires his share inancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it.\nMeaning of ancestral property in India-An ancestral property means a property which is devolved upon heirs by the 3 generations above them; father, father’s father or father’s fathers’ father. It passes to the next three generations.\nMeaning of will-A will means a document in which a person specifies the method to be applied in management and distribution of properties after his death.\nThe basic principle involved is that the property should be four generations old. The right to use and acquire property is accrued by persons through birth itself. The division of property is per stripes i.e. that share of one generation is calculated first than the share of successive generations is subdivided according to share of their predecessor. These basic elements are for governing majorly the Hindus.\nIf A inherits property, whether movable or immovable, from his father or father’s father, or father’s father’sfather, it is ancestral property as regards his male issue. If A has no son, son’s son, or son’s son’s son in existence at the time when he inherits the property, he holds the property as absolute owner thereof, and he can deal with it as he pleases . A person inheriting property from his three immediate paternal ancestors holds it, and must hold it, in coparcenary with his sons, sons’ sons and sons’ sons’ sons but as regards other relations he holds it and is entitled to hold it, as his absolute property.”[1]\nNow answer to the question is that that will to ancestral property is not entirelyillegal. That means when a coparcener acquires his share in ancestral property than he can make a will to that share and bequest it. However will shall be executed after the death of the testator and if the coparcener before acquiring a share makes a will than that will be illegal. Share in ancestral property will be inherited by coparceners. So he can make a will to his share in ancestral property.As whatever he acquires is his share now and he can dispose his assets according to his wishes.\nSurender Kumar vs Dhani Ram CS (OS) No.1737/2012 decided on 18th January, 2016 Hon’ble Mr. J. Valmiki Mehta of Delhi High Court ruled-\nIf a person dies after passing of the Hindu Succession Act, 1956 and there is no HUF existing at the time of the death of such a person, inheritance of an immovable property of such a person by his successors-in-interest is no doubt inheritance of an ‘ancestral’ property but the inheritance is as a self acquired property in the hands of the successor and not as an HUF property although the successor(s) indeed inherits ‘ancestral’ property i.e. a property belonging to his paternal ancestor.\n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

The plaintiff has been in continuous possession of the land for more than 60 years, which is the statutory period for adverse possession in most jurisdictions. The fact that the plaintiff does not have any other bills like EB or water connection does not necessarily mean that their possession is not hostile. The plaintiff has been using the land as a cow shelter, which is a clear indication that they are claiming the land as their own and excluding the true owner from possession.\nThe RDO may still decide to evict the plaintiff from the land, but the plaintiff would have a strong case against them. The plaintiff has a valid sale deed and HSD patta, and they have been in continuous possession of the land for more than 60 years. The RDO would need to show that the plaintiff's possession is not adverse, or that the plaintiff's title is invalid.\nThe permanent injunction would be decided based on the plaintiff's possession of the land. The plaintiff has a strong case for a permanent injunction, as they have been in continuous possession of the land for more than 60 years and they have a valid sale deed and HSD patta.\nHowever, it is important to note that the specific laws governing adverse possession and permanent injunctions vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. It is always best to consult with an attorney to discuss your specific situation.\nHere are some additional points to consider:\nThe plaintiff should be prepared to provide evidence of their continuous possession of the land, such as witness testimony, photographs, and tax records.\nThe plaintiff should also be prepared to argue that their possession is hostile, meaning that they have been claiming the land as their own and excluding the true owner from possession.\nThe plaintiff should be aware of the specific laws governing adverse possession and permanent injunctions in their jurisdiction.\n\nAdv. Sarika Khude\nRajgurunagar Pune\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nYes, in addition to the sale deed and HSD patta, the plaintiff in the permanent injunction complaint may also cite adverse possession. The plaintiff has owned the property continuously for more than 60 years, which is the time frame required by law for adverse possession in the majority of states. The absence of any other bills from the plaintiff, such as EB or a water connection, does not guarantee that their possession is not hostile. The plaintiff has been utilising the property as a cow shelter, which demonstrates their claim to ownership and exclusion of the rightful owner.\nThe plaintiff would have a strong evidence against the RDO even if they chose to evict them from the property. The plaintiff has been in continuous ownership of the land for more than 60 years and has a valid sale deed and HSD patta. The RDO would have to demonstrate that either the plaintiff's title is flawed or that the plaintiff's possession is not adverse.\nDepending on the plaintiff's ownership of the land, the permanent injunction would be decided. Given that they have had continuous possession of the property for more than 60 years, as well as the fact that they have a legal sale deed and HSD patta, the plaintiff has a compelling case for a permanent injunction.\nThe following are some extra considerations:\nThe plaintiff should be ready to offer proof of their ongoing ownership of the property, including witness testimony, pictures, and tax documents.\nAdditionally, the plaintiff must be prepared to establish that their possession is hostile since they have been claiming the property as their own while keeping the rightful owner out of it.\nThe plaintiff should be familiar with the local rules that regulate adverse possession and permanent injunctions.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThough there are many intricacies you should remember that you are in long possession of land having HSD patta to show your possession. Suit for injunction is right. Adverse possession is applicable only against the legal owner of a proper registered regular piece of land. So it's not applicable for you in your case. Is it HSD PATTA or B MEMO receipts? Kindly clarify for more clarity.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\n1. as the plaintiff is holding the possession of the land for the last 60 years the plaintiff will get the permanent injunction after going through the documents and the bills you are holding\n2. after you got the permanent injunction you file a separate suit based on the adverse  possession\n3. after that order mutate your name in the government revenue records  \nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

    "headline": "What can Criminal Court do if minor witness is not present",
    "data": " \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSir,\n\nIn 2021, our neighbour filed a false FIR against me and my mother U/S 325, 354B, 504, 506, 34 IPC. We obtained anticipatory bail and thereafter, Charge Sheet filed under the aforesaid sections. On each and every date we remained present before the Trial Court without fail but despite summons, complainant, his mother, his wife and his son (minor) are not being present in Court on any date. On the strength of non bailable warrant issued by Trial Court, complainant, his mother and his wife were arrested and forwarded them to the Court and ultimately their evidence was recorded and they were discharged. \n\nBut now the only problem is that complainant's son is not appearing in Court despite receiving summons. The said son is the minor witness. The Trial Court ordered that the guardian will produce such minor witness, even despite such direction, minor witness is not present. \nSir I know that Court can not issue warrant against minor witness but what is the remedy to secure the presence of such minor witness ? Because everytime, Court issues fresh summons upon such minor witness and minor witness receives summons and the on the date fixed he is being absent in Court. This game is going on since a long-time. Can Court issue warrant against his guardian i.e. the complainant ? Does the Court have such power ? If so, then under which section of Cr.P.C ? Pls Pls tell me. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tPray to court to close the evidence of minor witness, and move on the matter on merits.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnically court cannot issue warrant against guardian for non production of witness who is minor. Court can issue warrant. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe Criminal Procedure Code (CrPC) does not specifically mention the power of the court to issue a warrant against the guardian of a minor witness. However, there are a few sections of the CrPC that could be interpreted to allow the court to do so.\n\nSection 160 of the CrPC allows the court to issue a warrant for the arrest of any person who fails to appear before the court after being summoned. This section does not specifically mention minors, but it could be interpreted to include them.\n\nSection 162 of the CrPC allows the court to take the evidence of a minor witness in camera. This section also allows the court to order that the minor witness be produced in the court by their guardian.\n\nBased on these sections, it could be argued that the court has the power to issue a warrant against the guardian of a minor witness who fails to produce the minor witness in court. However, it is important to note that there is no clear precedent on this issue.\n\nIf you are concerned about the non-appearance of the minor witness, you should speak to your lawyer. They will be able to advise you on the best course of action, and they may be able to file a petition with the court requesting that the guardian of the minor witness be ordered to produce the minor witness in court.\n\nAdv.

Minors may be included even though this section does not directly mention them.\n\nThe court may hear a minor witness' testimony in secret under Section 162 of the Criminal Procedure Code. The court may also order that the minor witness be brought before it by their guardian under this clause.\n\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

According to Indian law system adultery is not consider as crime it will give wrong direction to society and demoralize society It will destroy many families if Indian woman involve in adultery and have extra marital affairs then according to Indian law system husband unable to award punishment to his wife through court It is a responsibility of Indian law maker to show right path to Indian society and citizens. All long Indian men or husband will survive with stigma that his wife involve in adultery and have extra marital affairs .\n\n4. According to Indian law system if man do wrong then very long and strict punishment awarded to man but if woman do same crime Indian law system treat them systematically and very low and nominal punishment awarded to woman why this double standards in Indian law system why Indian law system not treat Indian men and women equally.\n\n5. Why no action and no punishment awarded to police officials for register false FIR, advocate for pursue false case and fabricate or produce false evidences and honorable judges for award punishment to innocent in false case and ruined their lives can in Indian law system have any provision for this kindly clarify how and under which section.If not why.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tRead sec 181 to 211 of IPC\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tIndia law is excellent and only looser falsely blame it. Man is equally responsible. Clapping is not possible by one hand. If wife is asking her rights provided in law, then nothing is wrong. This not the right platform to vomit your frustration. Consult a good psychologist and also a competent lawyer. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe existence of National and State Women's Commissions in India is primarily to address and protect the rights and welfare of women, who historically have faced discrimination and marginalization. These commissions work towards gender equality and women's empowerment. However, it is worth noting that there are provisions in the Indian legal system to address men's issues as well. For instance, the National Human Rights Commission (NHRC) and State Human Rights Commissions (SHRCs) deal with various human rights violations, including those affecting men.\n\nIf a false case is registered against a man by a woman in India, the woman could be charged with filing a false complaint or providing false evidence, depending on the specific circumstances. Such actions are punishable under various sections of the Indian Penal Code (IPC), including Section 182 and Section 211.\n\nSection 182: Punishment for giving false information to a public servant.\nSection 211: False charge of an offense made with the intent to injure a person.\nThe punishment for these offenses may include imprisonment and/or a fine.\n\nAdultery was considered a criminal offense under Indian law until 2018 when the Supreme Court of India decriminalized it. The court held that adultery should be treated as a private matter between consenting adults rather than a criminal offense. The decision was based on principles of individual autonomy and privacy.\n\nIt is essential to differentiate between moral and legal aspects. While adultery may be morally wrong for some individuals, the law is designed to uphold certain principles of justice and privacy. The absence of criminalizing adultery does not mean that it is encouraged or supported by the legal system. Instead, civil remedies such as divorce and legal separation remain available to address issues arising from extramarital affairs.\n\nThe perception of unequal treatment in the Indian legal system regarding crimes committed by men and women can stem from various factors, including historical social norms and biases. It is essential to understand that the law aims to treat all individuals equally, regardless of gender.\n\nHowever, if there are instances where unequal treatment is perceived or demonstrated, it is essential to address them through discussions and reforms. The Indian legal system is subject to continuous development and improvement, and efforts are made to ensure fairness and equality in the administration of justice.\n\nIf someone, including police officials, advocates, or judges, is found to be involved in filing false FIRs, pursuing false cases, fabricating or producing false evidence, or rendering unjust judgments, there are provisions under the law to hold them accountable.\n\nFor police officials: Misconduct or filing a false FIR can lead to departmental inquiries, disciplinary actions, and even criminal prosecution under relevant provisions of the law.\nFor advocates: Filing false cases or fabricating evidence can result in professional misconduct proceedings, and they may face disciplinary action by the Bar Council of India or the concerned State Bar Councils.\nFor judges: If a judge is found to have rendered a judgment based on false evidence or misconduct, they can be subject to legal proceedings, and the higher judiciary may take appropriate action against them.\nHowever, it's crucial to understand that the legal process for addressing such issues may involve due process and investigations to ensure fairness and protect the rights of all parties involved. It is the responsibility of the concerned authorities to investigate and take appropriate action against those found guilty of wrongdoing.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir kindly put all this on social medea , not to lawyer . we deal with the problem what ever comes to us , we are not platform to discuss . sir the FIR is fake or not , it comes after the investigation only ,,how a person can know that the thing is false with out investigation . sir for the punishment for police and the lawyer is official matter , it can never come to the general public , no. general public has full right to submit their innocence evidence as alibi , after the investigation they are released .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ti understand your concern instead writing here kindly make representation of these facts and write to law ministry and prime minister office to make law on that. \nsecondly, adultery was crime for both men and women under ipc now it ground for divorce only,moreover if you aggrieved men than file cruelty and harassment complaint at concerned ssp office. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\n\nThe absence of national and state men's commissions in India might be due to various factors, including historical context, prevailing societal norms, and focus on specific gender-related issues. The establishment of such commissions could involve complex considerations.\n\nIf a false case is registered against a man by a woman, the specific punishment would depend on the details of the case, the evidence presented, and the sections of the Indian Penal Code that are relevant to the situation.\n\nAdultery laws and societal impact are subjects of debate. It's important for legal systems to evolve and consider various perspectives while addressing such matters. Changes in laws are typically driven by societal shifts and legislative processes.\n\nDiscussions around gender-based legal standards often involve complex considerations related to historical context, societal norms, and perspectives on equality. Legal systems may evolve over time to address these concerns.\n\nThe Indian legal system has provisions to address false FIRs, fabricated evidence, and miscarriages of justice. These might fall under sections related to perjury, false evidence, or abuse of authority. The application of such provisions depends on the specific circumstances and evidence presented during legal proceedings.\n\nMoreover, there had been many legal cases wherein the Hon’ble High Court and Supreme Court had considered these questions and provided verdict accordingly.\n\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

A codicil is a supplementary document that amends or adds to a will. It must be executed in the same way as a will, with the testator's signature witnessed by two people. The codicil should state that it is intended to amend the original will and should specifically identify the property that is being added. It is also a good idea to have the codicil registered at the same time as the original will.\nSection 63 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925: This section deals with the execution of wills. It states that a will must be in writing and signed by the testator in the presence of two witnesses.\nSection 68 of the Indian Succession Act, 1925: This section deals with codicils. It states that a codicil must be executed in the same way as a will.\nHope this advice will help you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNotary does not have any power of registration.

This is called a codicil. A codicil is a supplement to a will that changes or amends the terms of the will. It must be signed and witnessed in the same way as a will.\nIn your grandfather's case, he would need to make sure that the codicil specifically refers to the property that he is adding to the will. He would also need to make sure that the codicil is signed and witnessed by the same witnesses who signed the original will.\nOnce the codicil is executed, it will become part of the will and will be treated as if it was included in the will from the beginning. This means that the property that is mentioned in the codicil will be distributed to the beneficiaries named in the codicil, not the beneficiaries named in the original will.\nIt is important to note that a codicil cannot revoke the entire will. If your grandfather wants to revoke the entire will, he will need to make a new will that specifically revokes the original will.\n\nAdv. Sarika Khude\nRajgurunagar Pune\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

A writ of mandamus is a command issued by a court to a public official or body to perform a certain duty that is imposed on them by law.\nIn your case, the civil suit has been pending for about a year since the filing date. This could be considered a violation of natural justice, as the petitioner has a right to a speedy hearing.

The fact that he is now willing to give evidence in the miscellaneous case does not change this obligation. The wife can file a motion with the court to enforce the interim maintenance order.\nSection 65B of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, provides for the admissibility of electronic records as evidence. Under this section, an electronic record can be admitted as evidence if it is accompanied by a certificate signed by a gazetted officer or a person authorized by the court. The certificate must state that the electronic record is a true copy of the original record and that it has been produced in the manner specified in the section.\nIn the case of the wife's affidavit, the certificate under Section 65B is not essential for the admissibility of the evidence. If the court does not accept the affidavit without the certificate, the wife's advocate can try to obtain the certificate from the appropriate authority.\nIf the court does not accept your affidavit, you can appeal the decision. You can also file a motion with the court to reconsider its decision. In your appeal or motion, you should explain why the court should accept your affidavit. You should also address any concerns that the court may have about the admissibility of the affidavit. If you are successful in your appeal or motion, the court will order the affidavit to be admitted as evidence.\nI hope this advice will help you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFike ep husband shall br jailed for not giving maintenance  to wife kid if any\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

This means that your employer is responsible for paying you your full and final amount, even if you have left the organization.\nHope this would help you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tCall for accurate guidelines.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tcontact HR  and account department , in person for the same . if then too no answer then send legal show cause notice to the office and the head office regarding the same . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tI can provide some general guidance on possible steps you may consider taking:\n\nReview Your Employment Agreement: Look at the terms of your employment contract, company handbook, or any other relevant documents that outline the procedures and timelines for receiving your full and final settlement.\n\nDocument Communication: If you have already communicated with your employer about this issue, make sure to keep all email correspondence, letters, and other evidence of communication.\n\nSend a Formal Written Request: If you haven't done so, consider sending a formal written request (preferably via registered mail or email with confirmation) to your employer's HR department or appropriate authority, outlining the amount due, the efforts you've made to collect it, and the timeline you expect for payment.\n\nConsult with a Labor Lawyer or Legal Professional: If your employer continues to ignore your requests, you may wish to consult with a labor lawyer or legal professional in your jurisdiction. They can review your situation, provide specific legal advice, and may be able to send a legal notice on your behalf.\n\nContact a Labor Board or Regulatory Authority: Depending on your jurisdiction, there may be a government labor board or regulatory agency that oversees employer compliance with labor laws. They may be able to assist you with resolving the dispute.\n\nConsider Legal Action: If other avenues fail, legal action may be an option. This could involve filing a lawsuit or pursuing alternative dispute resolution like mediation or arbitration. A legal professional will be able to guide you through this process based on the laws in your jurisdiction.\n\nEvaluate the Costs and Benefits: Pursuing legal action may involve costs, such as legal fees. It's essential to weigh these against the amount you're trying to recover, and a legal professional can help you assess your options.\n\nProtect Your Rights: Employment and labor laws vary widely by jurisdiction, and there may be time limitations or specific procedures that must be followed to protect your rights. Acting promptly and seeking professional guidance can help ensure that you don't inadvertently forfeit any rights or remedies available to you.\n\nAgain, please consult with a legal professional in your jurisdiction, as they can provide advice and assistance tailored to your specific situation, location, and applicable laws.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In the list of scheduled property they have added one  self acquied property of us. We didn't tried to remove it because my lawyer gave wrong information to my father. We have all the documents to prove the ownership of that property. One of the brother who is on our side did appeal in high court against all properties(still not got stay order). Now is there any chance to rectify this order in Anekal district court. We also have reasons to convince judge if time limit is over.

Section 152 of the CPC states Amendment of judgments, decrees or orders.\n(1) Clerical or arithmetical mistake in any judgment, decree or order, or error arising therein from any accidental slip or omission may at any time be corrected by the Court either of its own motion or on the application of any of the parties.\n(2) No application for the purpose of this section shall be made after the expiry of six months from the date of the judgment, decree or order sought to be corrected.\nIn your case, the mistake in the order was that your self-acquired property was included in the list of scheduled properties. This is a clerical or arithmetical mistake, so you can apply to the court to rectify the order. You can apply to the court even if the time limit of six months has expired, but you will need to show the court that there is a good reason why you did not apply to the court earlier.\nI hope this advice is helpful to you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFile and application for the rectification of the order with all the evidence.

If you feel you've been subjected to cruelty, you have every right to seek legal recourse under this law.\n\nAs to where you can file the case, typically you can file the complaint where the alleged offense took place or where you are currently residing.\n\nThe jurisdiction of the case is generally determined based on where the alleged offense took place. If the alleged acts of cruelty happened in different places, each of those places could potentially have jurisdiction. If you have been residing in Bangalore after leaving your marital home due to the alleged cruelty, you can possibly file the complaint there.\n\nIt's not certain if the case would be transferred to your native place if you filed it in Bangalore. Jurisdictional issues can be complex and are decided on a case-by-case basis by the courts.\n\nHowever, the Supreme Court of India, in the case of Krishna Veni Nagam vs Harish Nagam in 2017, allowed for the transfer of cases on the basis of the convenience of the parties involved and for the interest of justice.

The section 209 satisfied as the ingredients of an offence under section 209 appears to be satisified.\n\nWhat is this (1) of Section 195 CrPC. Is it only applicable for public servants who made false claim? or any normal people who come to the court and made a false claim?. If it is only for public servants, normal victim can't use this 340 CrPC.  Kindly clarify.\n\n195. Prosecution for contempt of lawful authority of public servants, for offences against public justice and for offences relating to documents given in evidence.\n(1) No Court shall take cognizance-\n(a) (i) of any offence punishable under sections 172 to 188 (both inclusive) of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860 ), or\n(ii) of any abetment of, or attempt to commit, such offence, or\n(iii) of any criminal conspiracy to commit such offence, except on the complaint in writing of the public servant concerned or of some other public servant to whom he is administratively subordinate;\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSection 195is applicable to all   For public servants the punishment is s harsh.> File application and court will decide . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nsection 195 of CRPC will be applicable.\nSection 195 of the CrPC talks about prosecution for crimes against public justice, crimes involving documents used as evidence, and crimes involving contempt of the lawful authority of public servants.\nThe offences under the Section 195 of IPC have been categorized as Bailable offences. A bailable offence is those crimes or offences which are less serious in nature, in such cases bail is a right and the arrested person shall be released after depositing the bail with the police.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBased on your description, it seems you are seeking to initiate proceedings under Section 340 of the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC) for what you believe to be false statements or perjury committed by the petitioner.\n\nSection 340 of the CrPC is used when it is alleged that an offense affecting the administration of justice has been committed. This could include false evidence and offenses against public justice, as per the sections mentioned in Section 195(1)(b) of the CrPC.\n\nThese sections (193 to 196, 199, 200, 205 to 211, and 228 of the Indian Penal Code) refer to offenses such as giving false evidence, fabricating false evidence, using evidence known to be false, false statements made in declaration which is by law receivable as evidence, etc.\n\nAs per Section 195 of the CrPC, cognizance of such offenses can be taken only on a complaint in writing from the court before which the offense was allegedly committed. This is where Section 340 comes in. Section 340 provides a procedure for the court to make a complaint regarding such offenses.\n\nIn the context of your question, there is no requirement that the person who made the false claim must be a public servant. If it can be established that false evidence was given by any person in a judicial proceeding, then it is possible to invoke Section 340 of the CrPC.\n\nHowever, it is essential to understand that these are complex legal procedures and a lot will depend on the specific facts and circumstances of the case. I would strongly advise you to consult with a legal professional who can provide more specific advice based on the exact facts of your case.\n\nPlease note that this information is based on the legal understanding up until September 2021, and there may have been changes or amendments in the law since then.

Now the seller has waited for past 2 years for the government decision, now asking to go for GPA as there is no decision on this so far.\n\nMy Questions :-\n1) Whether I can go for GPA on this land or to back off from this deal by loosing the token amount ?\n1a) If GPA has to be made then what precaution to be taken that their legal heirs should not re-claim or the seller himself could not cancel this GPA and if I have build my own house or to resell it after building house or to resell the land  in future.\n1b)  If GPA gets registered ,  will it reflect in Encumbrance Certificate (EC).\n1c) Whether the GPA can be cancelled by seller itself without my notice to tme, then I would be impacted ?\n\n(or) \n\n2) Should I have to wait for the government decision by giving some more amount to the seller ?\n2a) If I have to go with some more amount  do I have get MOU  and whether it should be sufficient  if notarized ?\n\n3) Is there any other way to over come this situation i.e to proceed to buy that land.\n\n\nRegards,\n\nKamlesh Kumar\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\n\nRegarding GPA (General Power of Attorney): a) GPA can be an option to proceed with the land deal, but it's crucial to ensure the document is legally binding and safeguards your interests. \n b) To protect your rights, the GPA should be drafted carefully to prevent legal heirs from making claims or the seller from canceling it without your consent. Include clauses about house-building rights and future resale conditions. \nc) The impact of GPA on the Encumbrance Certificate (EC) may vary based on local regulations. \n\nWaiting for the Government Decision: \na) Waiting for the government decision may be an option, but it's essential to clarify with the seller on the additional amount and any terms through a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). It's advisable to get this MOU notarized to make it legally enforceable.\n\nExploring Other Options: Consider discussing alternative solutions with the seller, such as finding another mutually agreeable property or exploring different legal arrangements that protect both parties' interests.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Mr. Kumar,\n\nI understand your predicament and I will try to give you the best guidance possible based on the legal understanding up to September 2021. However, please consult with a legal professional who can provide the most accurate and updated advice, as real estate laws can be complex and can vary from state to state.\n\nGoing for a GPA (General Power of Attorney) is generally not considered as safe or legally solid as an outright purchase because a GPA does not give you ownership rights, only possession rights. The original owner can still legally sell the property. You may lose your token amount if you decide to back out, depending on the terms of your agreement.\n1a) If you decide to go for a GPA, make sure it is properly registered. It should be clearly stated in the GPA that it is irrevocable. Ensure that the GPA specifically mentions your right to construct a house on the property and sell it. However, remember that a GPA can't stop the seller or his legal heirs from selling the property unless it's explicitly mentioned and legally binding.\n\n1b) A registered GPA should reflect in the Encumbrance Certificate, but this can vary based on regional laws and practices.\n\n1c) If the GPA is explicitly stated to be irrevocable, the seller cannot cancel it unilaterally. However, this depends on the exact terms of the GPA and local laws.\n\nWaiting for the government decision is a personal decision based on your risk tolerance and how much you value the land.\n2a) If you decide to give more money, an MOU (Memorandum of Understanding) can provide additional protection. A notarized MOU has legal standing but is not as strong as a registered document.\n\nAs for other ways to buy the land, you could consider setting up a joint venture with the owner or buying a share in the owner's company if it's a company-owned land. Consult with a legal professional for more options.\nPlease note that this advice is based on the legal understanding up to 2021 and there may have been changes since. Always consult a legal professional for the most accurate advice.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir due to many fraud , it is honorable supreme court verdict to stop all types of property registration ,  file request petition at the DJ court for the same .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Can this Amendment be challenged?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\nIn the run-up to the Assembly polls, the Congress had promised to amend the PTCL Act. Dalit groups have been demanding the removal of the time bar for claims on lands that were originally granted to them but were subsequently sold or taken over by others.\nThe Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands (Amendment) Bill, 2023 was tabled in the state legislature on July 19 after a special Cabinet meeting. The Congress had promised to amend the law in the run-up to the Assembly polls.\nOn July 7, during his Budget speech, Chief Minister Siddaramaiah had stated that he was intent on amending the PTCL Act. “In order to enable SC/ST land grantees to appeal for restoration of land, suitable amendments will be made to the Karnataka Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prohibition of Transfer of Certain Lands) Act, 1978 by prescribing timeline in the Act itself,” he had stated.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes if it affects you  . you can  not challenge if you are not personally affected . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe State Legislature has power to amend any Act, which is concerned with state subjects. Since, land is a state subject, hence the State Legislature can amend it. However, such amendment cannot be inconsistent with the provision of the Constitution or cause unreasonable and irreparable loss to the public.\nReasonable time period and fixed time period are two distinct interpretations.\nFixed time limit is governed by the law of limitation, where time limit is prescribed and none can be allowed to breach the limitation, unless courts condone the delay, which means that the court has discretionary power to extend the limitation period in certain situation to ensure end of justice.\nWhereas, the reasonable time means a fair time limit under which the aggrieved party can approach the court, when no specific time limit has been mentioned.\n25 years is not a reasonable time limit, but an unreasonable delay, which violates the Law of Equity, which speaks that\" law supports only those who are agile for their rights and not those who are sleeping\".\n\nand hence, it can be challenged in the court, if such amendment causes irreparable loss to him.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir kindly contact the department in person .to find the details , then go for any action . no hurry .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This process usually requires a gift deed to be executed, and it varies based on local laws and regulations.\nPartition Deed: If the property is co-owned with others, you can execute a partition deed to divide the property among the co-owners. This will result in your share of the property being transferred to the other co-owners.\nRelinquishment Deed: In case you co-own the property with others and wish to give up your share, you can execute a relinquishment deed. This legal document will formalize the process of surrendering your rights to the property.\nInheritance: If you pass away, your ownership of the property can be transferred to your heirs through the legal process of inheritance, according to the laws of intestate succession or a valid will.\nObtain No Objection Certificate (NOC): Your sister may need to provide a No Objection Certificate (NOC) stating that she has no objection to your removal from the property papers. This document is often required to ensure that the transfer is not done under duress.\nStamp Duty and Registration: Depending on your region's laws, stamp duty, and registration fees might apply to the transfer deed. \nUpdate Property Records: Once the legal transfer is complete, the relevant property records must be updated to reflect the change in ownership. This will involve updating the land registry or any other government authority responsible for property records.\n\nRemember, each of these processes can have legal and financial implications, including taxes and fees.\nThank You \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tExecute necessary rectification deeds.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBY registering relinquish deed or gift deed as it suits you according to stamp duty rules . click\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tU make relinquishment In favor of your sister and inform sister and society\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir ask the area sub registrar about the rectification process , if they say not possible then ,  make  the registered relinquish deed , in sister favor.  but for sure remember it will be done only once , not repeatedly , as now you want to leave and after some time you prefer to take it back . nothing like the same . so rethink .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDO the relinquishment and release deed in her name.\n\nClick thumbs up for my comments to appreciate!\nyou can reach me through PathLegal for consultation.\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou register a release deed in the name of your sister and release all your rights on that property in her name. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Sir,\nYou have to execute Release Deed in favour of your sister relinquishing your share of 50% in favour of your sister then approach the concerned authorities to remove your ownership from the records. \n\nI could have explained more if background is known to me.

If an employer is forcefully asking an employee to resign, it could potentially be a violation of Indian labor laws.\nProtection under Industrial Disputes Act, 1947 (IDA):\nThe Industrial Disputes Act provides protection to employees against wrongful termination or dismissal. If the employer coerces an employee into resigning, it may be treated as a \"retrenchment\" under the IDA, and the employee could be entitled to certain protections and benefits.\nConstructive Dismissal:\nIn India, constructive dismissal occurs when the employer makes working conditions so unbearable that the employee is forced to resign.

If you prove your allegations then on the ground of cruelty you can get divorce. Maintenance is separate and is necessary for livelihood so wife who, if, is not having sufficient income is entitled to maintenance, alimony, residence etc. Wife version is sldo required to be looked into. Clap is not possible by single hand. Though in 80% such cases are false but there are 20% genuine cases also where husband and his family have caused physical and mental cruelty against wife. Nothing wrong if wife exhaust available legal remedies. Indian judicial system is excellent.Criminals always plead innocence. The case is a matrimonial dispute and is not a case of gender bias. \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe case details which you provided shows that the wife will not be entitled to claim any type of maintenance or alimony if she is intentionally doing harm to you and your family. Now to the divorce, the case is leaning towards you in your case as you said you have all the evidences against her so she will not be able to deny those when put on trial. The property of your parents have nothing to do in the case of divorce as the assets of both the parties are assessed not the property of the parents. Now coming to he issue that you raised about the gender biasness that is because court believes that even if the guilty escapes but no innocent should suffer so they always presume that the female party in the divorce cases are victims which are often misused by them too. Now to the maintenance or alimony to be giving to your wife, I can tell you that it is law that every husband should maintain his wife but the amount you will have to give will greatly vary due to the circumstances of the case.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir go for the FIR and file case at the family court for the same . no sir then wife is not eligible to get any thing from husband , rather she needs to pay fine to the husband for the same . sir as no one can return the time for the same only fine system is there . no sir the justice is tried to delayed by the public only as they do not provide the evidence , law never deny the same . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear Client,\n\nUnder Indian laws, a wife's entitlement to maintenance or alimony does not depend on her performance of marital duties. Maintenance and alimony are provided to ensure the financial well-being of the wife and are not contingent upon her fulfilling specific marital obligations. The primary consideration is whether the wife is unable to maintain herself financially.\n\nHere are the key points to understand:\n\nHindu Marriage Act, 1955: Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act allows either spouse (husband or wife) to claim interim maintenance during the pendency of a divorce case. The court may grant maintenance based on the financial needs and income of the spouse seeking maintenance, without considering any specific performance of marital duties.\n\nSection 125 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: This section applies to all religions, and it allows a wife (including those in a void or voidable marriage) to claim maintenance from her husband if she is unable to maintain herself. The court will consider factors such as the husband's income, the wife's needs, and other dependents while determining the quantum of maintenance.\n\nDomestic Violence Act, 2005: This act allows women in domestic relationships to claim maintenance from their husbands if they are subjected to domestic violence or are living in a shared household. Again, the focus is on the financial needs of the aggrieved party, not on the performance of marital duties. \n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In your case, the police have already denied to register an FIR based on the complaint of the lady. If the court now orders the police to register an FIR, it will be a case of judicial overreach.  if the court does order the police to register an FIR, the police can arrest you if they have a warrant from the court. The fact that you are already on bail in another case will not prevent the police from arresting you in this case.\nSection 156 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973: This section states that a police officer can register an FIR if he has reason to believe that a cognizable offence has been committed.\nThank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tBoth the cases will be deemed as two separate cases and if the court orders the police to register FIR, you may be arrested.\nIt would be better to defend your case fiercely and apply for anticipatory bail before the Session Court, so that you could not get arrested, once the FIR is lodged.\nYou may contact me for professional consultation through call or whatsapp to discuss in detail.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYes.

The case in which you got bail is different from the one in which the complaint has been filed by the lady.

I go legally against the company, I afraid they may hold my relieving letter and experience letter..\nPlease suggest what can I do?\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear client,\n\nIssue legal notice through advocate stating your greviences to your appointing authority,  to allow your resignation. Then complaint before labour commissioner. \nGenerally these kind of matters are settled amicably after issuing legal notice itself,  and they will not hold your relieving letter and experience letter.\n\nYou may call or mail me through pathlegal for professional assistance. I can help you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tReview your agreement: Carefully read your employment agreement to ensure there are no hidden clauses or policies regarding the notice period. Even if it's not explicitly stated in the agreement, there might be company policies or handbooks that provide additional information about notice periods.\nTalk to your current employer: Have an open conversation with your employer about your situation and the new job offer. Explain your intentions and try to negotiate a mutually agreeable solution. They may be willing to be flexible under certain circumstances.\nRequest an early release: Ask your current employer if they would consider an early release, given the lack of a notice period clause in your agreement. Be polite and professional in your approach.\nReview the new job offer: Check if the new company can accommodate a later joining date. They might be understanding of your situation and be willing to adjust the start date to accommodate your notice period requirements.\n\nAdv.

This will allow you to join your new job on October 2, 2023. However, you will not be paid for the 60 days of the notice period.\nYou can ask your employer to waive the 60-day notice period. This is unlikely, but it is worth asking. If your employer agrees to waive the notice period, you will be able to join your new job on October 2, 2023 and you will be paid for the full month of September.\nSection 35 of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947: This section states that an employer cannot force an employee to work beyond the notice period.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tYou put your resignation by email etc and if agreement does not prov8de for notice period then give a specific date by month ending date as your last working date and join new company. In utter precaution you can date after 60 days without mentioning notice period of 60 days.

The decree is typically granted in cases where the spouses have been living apart for a period of time and one spouse wants to end the separation.\nIn your case, you have been awarded an RCR decree by the court. The decree has been in effect for 120 days, but your wife has not yet returned to the marital home. You have also filed an execution petition with the court, but the outcome of the petition is still pending. You can file for a divorce petition even though the execution petition is still pending.\nSection 13 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955: This section states that a husband or wife can file for divorce if the other spouse has willfully and without reasonable cause refused to perform their marital obligations for a continuous period of at least two years.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tn most cases, a divorce petition can typically be filed at any time, even if there are ongoing proceedings related to the execution of an earlier decree. The divorce petition is a separate legal matter from the execution petition, which is focused on enforcing the previous court order.\n\nGiven that you have been living separately for four years, it appears that you may have grounds for a divorce based on the length of separation. However, the specific grounds for divorce and the legal requirements vary by jurisdiction.\n\nAdv.

The Court can grant both interim and final decision to one party also.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tThe likelihood of a final order (decision) being in favor of a party can vary based on several factors and the specific circumstances of the case. Interim orders are temporary decisions made by the court to address immediate issues until the final judgment is delivered. The final order may or may not align with the interim order, as the court will consider all the evidence, arguments, and legal principles before reaching a final decision.\n\nFactors that may influence the final order include:\n\n    Strength of Evidence: The evidence presented by both parties during the trial can significantly impact the final decision. Strong and convincing evidence may sway the court in favor of one party.\n\n    Legal Arguments: The legal arguments made by the parties and their legal representatives will be evaluated by the court. The strength of these arguments and their alignment with applicable laws can influence the final decision.\n\n    Case Precedents: Previous court decisions in similar cases (case precedents) can influence the final judgment, as courts often refer to these precedents to guide their decisions.\n\n    Witness Testimonies: Credible witness testimonies can play a crucial role in supporting a party's claims and influencing the final outcome.\n\n    Judges' Discretion: Judges have the discretion to make decisions based on their interpretation of the law and the facts presented in the case.\n\n    Changed Circumstances: If there are significant changes in the circumstances of the case between the time of the interim order and the final judgment, it may impact the outcome.\n\nIt's essential to remember that every case is unique, and predicting the exact outcome of a legal proceeding is challenging. The final order will be based on a thorough evaluation of all the evidence and legal arguments presented during the trial. It's crucial to have proper legal representation and ensure that all relevant evidence and arguments are effectively presented to maximize the chances of a favorable final order.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir interim order is,  demand order for some thing, or to provide some thing ,  between the case , final order is case over . no presumption please .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Next day divorce can be filed. For ground of desertion 2 years separation. Husband is bound to pay maintenance till the death of wife or till she gets married. \n2. Yes husband and wife can make settlement but unless wife confirm and accept settlement in court such settlement is useless. Mutual divorce case can be filed only by husband and wife both. Single party cannot file divorce by mutual consent divorce. \n3. Wife donot have any right in her in laws property but she is entitled to 50% share in husband's properties acquired after marriage. \n4. Yes, husband can file. \n5. Yes.

Until the wife passes away or until she marries, the husband is obligated to make maintenance payments. \nFor a mutual divorce, which is when both parties agree to the divorce, the minimum period of separation required is one year. Section 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 deals with the provision for mutual divorce by husband and wife.\n2. Yes, a settlement between a husband and wife is possible, but it is pointless unless the woman approves it in court. Only a husband and wife can file for a mutual divorce. By mutual consent, a single party cannot initiate a divorce. \nSection 13B of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955 deals with the provision for mutual divorce by husband and wife.\n3. NO, wife don't have any right on husband and husband parents property and bank balance. The woman has no claim to the ancestral property of the deceased husband unless and until she inherits it from him. However, the wife is entitled to a share that is equal to that of a son in the event of a joint family property division (between her husband and his sons).\n4. Divorce by mutual consent can be obtained within six months, but no petition in such a case can be filed within first year of marriage. There also has to be gap of six months between the first and second motions. The court can waive this cooling off period in some cases.\n5. YES a cruel or mentally torture wife to husband and husband parents eligible for maintenance or alimony from husband. Section 25 of the Hindu Marriage Act, mentions the terms alimony and maintenance.\n\nThank You\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir call and discuss. never go for the out of court settlement as it has no evidence .wife has right on every thing of husband. but no right on in laws things no . mutual divorce . evidence is needed FIR copy is needed for the torture .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

It is a binding source of international law that all UN member states are required to comply with.\nThe Geneva Conventions are a set of international treaties that protect the victims of war. They set out rules on the treatment of prisoners of war, the wounded and sick, and civilians in times of war.\nThe Universal Declaration of Human Rights is a non-binding declaration that sets out the fundamental human rights of all people.

Here are the general steps involved in filing a complaint under Section 498A:\n\nFiling the Complaint: The complainant, who is usually the wife or a relative of the wife, can file a complaint at the police station where the offense occurred or where the complainant resides. It is essential to provide detailed information about the incident, the accused individuals, and any supporting evidence.\n\nRegistration of FIR: Once the complaint is filed, the police should register a First Information Report (FIR) based on the complaint. An FIR is a formal document that launches the criminal investigation.\n\nInvestigation: After the FIR is registered, the police will conduct an investigation into the allegations made in the complaint. They may record statements of the complainant, witnesses, and the accused, collect evidence, and conduct inquiries.\n\nArrest (if necessary): If the police believe that there is enough evidence to support the complaint, they may arrest the accused individuals.\n\nChargesheet: After completing the investigation, the police will file a chargesheet in court, detailing the evidence gathered during the investigation.\n\nTrial: The case proceeds to trial in a court of law. During the trial, both the prosecution (representing the state) and the defense (representing the accused) will present their arguments and evidence.\n\nVerdict: Based on the evidence and arguments presented during the trial, the court will make a judgment. If the accused is found guilty, they may face penalties under the law.\n\nThe duration of the entire process can vary depending on several factors, including the complexity of the case, the workload of the police and courts, and any legal challenges or appeals.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSection 498A of the Indian Penal Code, which deals with cruelty against married women by their husbands or in-laws. Please note that laws and procedures can vary, and it's essential to consult a legal professional for advice specific to your situation and jurisdiction. Additionally, my information might not be up-to-date, so it's always best to verify with current sources.\n\n    Section 498A of the Indian Penal Code:\n    Section 498A deals with \"Cruelty by husband or relatives of husband.\" It aims to protect married women from harassment and cruelty by their husbands and in-laws.\n\n    Filing a Complaint:\n    If you believe you are a victim of cruelty and harassment within your marriage, you can file a complaint with the police. Typically, these complaints are registered at the Women's Cell or Crime Against Women (CAW) Cell in your local police station. However, if there is no women's cell nearby, you can file the complaint at the regular police station.\n\n    Documents and Evidence:\n    When filing the complaint, it's crucial to provide all relevant information and supporting documents, such as details of the alleged incidents, any evidence of cruelty, medical reports (if applicable), and names of the accused.\n\n    Investigation:\n    After the complaint is lodged, the police will initiate an investigation into the matter. They may record statements from the complainant, the accused, and any witnesses. They might also collect evidence, such as medical reports or any other relevant documents.\n\n    Mediation:\n    In some cases, the police might suggest mediation between the parties to resolve the dispute amicably. However, if the matter is of a severe nature, mediation might not be pursued.\n\n    Filing of FIR and Chargesheet:\n    If the police find sufficient evidence to support the complaint, they will file an FIR (First Information Report). After completing the investigation, they will submit a chargesheet in the court.\n\n    Court Proceedings:\n    Once the chargesheet is filed, the court proceedings will begin. Both parties will be summoned, and the trial will take place. The accused will have the opportunity to present their defense and counter the allegations made in the chargesheet.\n\n    Trial and Verdict:\n    The court will conduct the trial based on the evidence presented and arguments made by both parties. After considering all aspects, the court will deliver its verdict. If the accused is found guilty, appropriate legal actions will be taken.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

The Special Marriage Act, 1954, which governs registered marriages in India, does not require the consent of parents or guardians for a person to get married. However, the marriage must be registered with the Registrar of Marriages in the district where it is solemnized. The registration certificate will be issued to the couple and will be a public document. This means that anyone can search for it on the Registrar of Marriages' website.\n\nIn your specific case, if your daughter secretly got married in West Bengal, her father or guardian could search for the marriage registration on the Registrar of Marriages' website. If they find the registration, they will be able to see the date of the marriage, the names of the couple, and the place where the marriage was solemnized.\n\nIt is important to note that even if a marriage is registered, it does not necessarily mean that it is valid. For example, if the couple was not of legal age to get married, or if they were not mentally competent to give their consent, the marriage could be declared invalid. If you are concerned about the validity of your daughter's marriage, you should consult with an attorney.\n\nHere are some additional things to keep in mind:\n\nThe Special Marriage Act does not require that a registered marriage be solemnized in a religious ceremony. However, many couples choose to have a religious ceremony in addition to the civil registration.\nIf a couple is married under the Special Marriage Act, they are not required to live together. However, if they do live together, they will be considered to be legally married.\nA registered marriage under the Special Marriage Act is not automatically dissolved if the couple gets divorced under religious law. If the couple wants to dissolve their marriage, they will need to file for divorce under the Special Marriage Act.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1.

Explain to them that you are not trying to take any of their land, and that you are simply trying to correct an error in the land records. If they are still not willing to cooperate, you can try the following steps.\nFile a complaint with the SDM. The SDM is the Sub-Divisional Magistrate, and they are responsible for land records in their jurisdiction. You can file a complaint with the SDM explaining the situation, and requesting that they order the correction of the land records.\nFile a civil suit. If the SDM does not order the correction of the land records, you can file a civil suit in court. In the civil suit, you can ask the court to order the correction of the land records, and to award you damages if your neighbors have suffered any losses as a result of the error.\nIt is important to note that the court will only order the correction of the land records if it is satisfied that there is an error in the records. The court will also consider the interests of all the parties involved, including your neighbors.\n\nHere are some additional things to keep in mind:\n\nThe correction of land records is a complex process, and it is important to seek legal advice if you are considering taking action.\nThe court may order the correction of the land records even if your neighbors are not willing to cooperate. However, the court may also order that you compensate your neighbors for any losses they have suffered as a result of the error.\nIf you are not satisfied with the decision of the court, you can appeal the decision to a higher court.\n\nAdv.

This means that if you are summoned to produce a document in a criminal case, you will not be cross-examined unless you are asked to be a witness.\nSection 146 of the Indian Evidence Act states that the cross-examination of a witness may relate to any matter relevant to the issue in the case, or to the credibility of the witness. This means that the APP can cross-examine you on the documents that you produce, as well as on any other relevant matters, such as your knowledge of the documents, the circumstances in which you came to possess the documents, and the accuracy of the documents.\nHope you got enough knowledge  regarding the matter.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDear brother / sister\n1. yes the APP will cross examine\n2. the scope of the cross examination is wide and it is left to the APP and the Magistrate\n3. without appearing in the witness box  you cant mark your document\n\nAdvocate, A.P.Loganathan, Madras High Court\nPlease click LIKE for encouraging/appreciating me\nFor more clarification contact me, getting details from path legal or Google site\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tdepends on the need of the court . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tWhen you produce your documents, you will have to swear an affidavit called the proof affidavit.

Then in May 2014, the land seller, with  6 other persons of the inheritance who his wife, sons and daughter were mutation to the revenue records as partners. And by verbally canceling the contract as per the agreement, in the meantime, the seller paid back all the amount given under the agreement of the land to the buyer  by the cheque.

The buyer has a weak case and the buyer has waited too long to file the lawsuit. Under the Transfer of Property Act Section 3, a registered sale-deed is a notice to all other persons who have an interest in the property. The buyer has had eight years to object to the sale of the land to the other six co-owners, but the buyer has not done so.\nThe buyer is now trying to sue the seven co-owners for specific performance. However, the buyer has no legal basis for this lawsuit. The buyer has already received a refund of the money that the buyer paid for the land. The buyer has also had eight years to object to the sale of the land to the other six co-owners, but the buyer has not done so.\nThank you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir basically the case is week on both side , then too discuss with lawyer in person. to discuss every if and but of the case . \t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

This means that the land is not subject to the provisions of the Act and you can purchase it regardless of its size.\n\nDear Client,\nIf you want to purchase a piece of land that is less than 11 guntas in size and zoned as residential, you will need to obtain the following permissions:\nPermission from the local authority: The local authority will need to approve your plan to construct a house on the land.\nConversion of land to non-agricultural (NA) use: If the land is currently classified as agricultural land, you will need to obtain permission from the local authority to convert it to non-agricultural use.\nBuilding permission: You will need to obtain a building permission from the local authority before you can start construction on the house.\nThe process for obtaining these permissions may vary depending on the local authority. You should contact the local authority for more information.\nIt is important to note that the Maharashtra government has recently amended the Act to allow for the fragmentation of agricultural land below the prescribed standard area in certain cases. \nHope this would help you.\nThank you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\ttake collector permission .\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

The below are the remedies available to you.\nFile a declaration of title suit: You can file a declaration of title suit in the court. In a declaration of title suit, you can claim that you are the rightful owner of the property. You can also claim that the gift deed is invalid because it was executed after the sale deed was validated.\nFile a suit for specific performance: You can file a suit for specific performance in the court. In a suit for specific performance, you can claim that the seller is obligated to transfer the property to you. You can also claim that the gift deed is invalid because it was executed after the sale deed was executed.\nFile a suit for damages: You can file a suit for damages in the court. In a suit for damages, you can claim that you have suffered damages as a result of the seller's breach of contract. You can also claim that the gift deed is invalid because it was executed after the sale deed was executed.\nThe best possible way to proceed in this case is to file a declaration of title suit. This will ensure that your ownership of the property is legally recognized. You can also file a suit for specific performance or a suit for damages, but these suits may not be as effective as a declaration of title suit.\nSection 34 in The Specific Relief Act, 1963 which deals with Discretion of court as to declaration of status or right.\nHope this would solve the issue.\nThanking you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFile it immidately take stay also\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tsir  yes you need to go for the declaration of the property . go for it . with the purchase deed . injunction has no role in it . reason the sign of the witness is not there . \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

In their suit, they can claim that the second wife had no right to sell the property as she was not a legal heir. They can also claim that the sale of the property was fraudulent and void. Once the children of the first wife have filed their suit, the court will appoint a commissioner to investigate the matter. The commissioner will visit the property and prepare a report on its condition and value. The court will then hear the arguments of both parties and decide whether to grant the children of the first wife a share in the property. If the court grants the children of the first wife a share in the property, the second wife will be required to return the property to them or pay them compensation.\nSection 53 of Transfer of Property act deals with the fraudulent transfer which was done by the second wife in this case. \nHope you got the sufficient amount of information related to the matter.\nThanking you.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Some of the house owners are interested in going for correction of that aforesaid difference and while approaching the Town panchayat officer they said they will give kootu patta only for the lower grounds (i.e 9.88 against 10.66). How do we approach. It it so can we able to get the higher sq.ft approvals. Becoz we almost loose 20 sq.ft per flat owner which some of us does not wants to loose.

As per this act, you need to obtain a license from the concerned authorities before digging a borewell or extracting groundwater for any purpose. The license is issued by the Ground Water Department of Haryana, and you can apply for it online through their website.\n\nThe license will specify the quantity of groundwater that can be extracted, the purpose for which it can be used, and the location of the borewell. The license fee varies depending on the quantity of groundwater to be extracted and the purpose of usage.\n\nIt is also important to note that indiscriminate and excessive groundwater extraction can lead to depletion of groundwater resources and can cause environmental damage. Therefore, it is advisable to use groundwater judiciously and in a sustainable manner.\n\nI hope this information helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t"

Anticipatory bail is a type of bail that is granted before arrest, and it can help protect you from arrest for a certain period of time.\n\n4. Collect evidence: It is important that you collect and preserve any evidence that can support your defense. This can include communication records, financial records, and witness statements. Your lawyer can advise you on what evidence is relevant and how to collect it.\n\n5. Stay calm and composed: It is important that you stay calm and composed during the legal proceedings.

This crime is referred as “False evidence”.\n\nSection 191 of the IPC deals with false evidence which deals with making a false statement under oath which he believes to be false and still makes it knowing its falsehood.\nThe Punishment in Section 193of the IPC would extend till seven years with fine. Intentional fabrication of false evidence would further increase the term for another three years with fine,\nFalse evidence would also be punished if one uses corrupt or false or fabricated evidence, with knowledge of it being false. Such an Act would be punished under Section 196 of the IPC.\n\nThe Supreme Court observed that the tendering of affidavits and undertakings containing false statement would amount to contempt of court. A person who who makes a false statement before the Court and makes an attempt to deceive the Court, interferes with the administration of justice and is guilty of contempt of court. \n\nThank You\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNo case of contempt or perjury is made out.
