Instead of giving vouchers, they started to sell thier membership. We denied multiple times but they were keep insisting us. Finally they offered us in discounted prices with monthly EMI of 1934/- for 24 monthsThey instructed us to sign the contract. We signed without reading term and conditionWhen we came back to home, we realised that there is annual maintenance charges of 8500. I immediately requested for cancellation.The next day I got a call and the agent told me that the amount is not refundable. But in term & condition it is mentions that if you cancel, the charge 30% in 1 to 7 days. But I cancelled in 3 hours. Can I get refund coz I am not falling in 1 to 7 days slab. "
