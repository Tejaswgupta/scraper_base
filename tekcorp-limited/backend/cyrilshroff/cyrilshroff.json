    "data": "Introduction:A division bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, comprising Hon’ble Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice J. B. Pardiwala in Celir LLP v. Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Pvt. Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”).

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

USD 27 million) for restricting and controlling the discounts offered by its dealers to the end consumers. Such conduct by India’s leading passenger vehicle manufacturer was held to be anti-competitive resale price maintenance (RPM), and thus violative of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 (as amended) (Competition Act).

This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

Can I send the money through a private trust?—Name withheld on requestIt is trite law that a personal action or claim extinguishes with the death of a person. This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”).

Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict.

Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors.

However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

    "data": "Introduction:A division bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, comprising Hon’ble Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice J. B. Pardiwala in Celir LLP v. Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Pvt. Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Draft M&A Regulations would replace the current CCI (Procedure in regard to the transactions of business relating to combinations) Regulations, 2011 (Combinations Regulations, 2011).2022 was an eventful year for competition law in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants. The recent updates seem to be aimed at investor protection and ensuring compliance with the existing array of laws related to AIF Regulations.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 30th May, 2023.

Can I send the money through a private trust?—Name withheld on requestIt is trite law that a personal action or claim extinguishes with the death of a person. This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”).

Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict.

Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors.

However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

    "data": "Introduction:A division bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, comprising Hon’ble Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice J. B. Pardiwala in Celir LLP v. Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Pvt. Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Draft M&A Regulations would replace the current CCI (Procedure in regard to the transactions of business relating to combinations) Regulations, 2011 (Combinations Regulations, 2011).2022 was an eventful year for competition law in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants. The recent updates seem to be aimed at investor protection and ensuring compliance with the existing array of laws related to AIF Regulations.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 30th May, 2023.

Can I send the money through a private trust?—Name withheld on requestIt is trite law that a personal action or claim extinguishes with the death of a person. This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”).

Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict.

Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors.

However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

    "data": "Introduction:A division bench of the Hon’ble Supreme Court, comprising Hon’ble Chief Justice D.Y. Chandrachud and Justice J. B. Pardiwala in Celir LLP v. Bafna Motors (Mumbai) Pvt. Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Draft M&A Regulations would replace the current CCI (Procedure in regard to the transactions of business relating to combinations) Regulations, 2011 (Combinations Regulations, 2011).2022 was an eventful year for competition law in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants. The recent updates seem to be aimed at investor protection and ensuring compliance with the existing array of laws related to AIF Regulations.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 30th May, 2023.

Can I send the money through a private trust?—Name withheld on requestIt is trite law that a personal action or claim extinguishes with the death of a person. This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”).

Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it.

The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations.

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt.

The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1].

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region.

It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict.

Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs. DRS Logistics and held that Google cannot escape liability in case of trademark infringement by an AdWord, by claiming benefit of safe harbour provisions under the Information Technology Act, 2000.Introduction:The new draft guidelines titled ‘Guidelines for Prevention and Regulation of Dark Patterns, 2023’[1] (“Draft Dark Pattern Guidelines”), released by the Department of Consumer Affairs in September 2023, define dark patterns as “any practices or deceptive design patterns using UI/UX (user interface/user experience) interactions on any platform; designed to mislead or trick users to do something they originally did not intend or want to do; by subverting or impairing the consumer autonomy, decision making or choice; amounting to misleading advertisement or unfair trade practice or violation of consumer rights”."

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime.

This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor.

It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors.

However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary.

It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

Ltd. and Ors[1] on September 21, 2023, held that a borrower only has right of mortgage redemption till the publication of auction notice under Section 13(8) of Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security Interest Act (“SARFAESI Act”). The Hon’ble Supreme Court analysed orders passed by various Hon’ble High Courts in interpreting the provisions of Section 13(8) of the SARFEASI Act, post the amendment in 2016 (“Amendment”) and the intent of the Amendment.INTRODUCTIONIt is trite law that while criminal proceedings operate in rem, the consequence of such proceedings (viz. imprisonment) impacts the liberties of individual person(s). It is equally well settled that legal heirs of an accused/ convict cannot be made to serve imprisonment on the death of the accused/ convict. This begs the question whether the demise of the individual also sounds the death knell on the connected criminal proceedings against him. In the present article, we explore whether the criminal appellate/ revisional proceedings would abate ipso facto on the death of the accused/ convict.The Hon’ble Calcutta High Court in Rohan Builders (India) Pvt. Ltd v Berger Paints India Limited 2023 SCC OnLine Cal 2645 recently deliberated on the issue of whether Courts can extend an arbitral tribunal’s mandate under Section 29A(4) of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“the Act”), after the mandate of the arbitral tribunal has been terminated.BackgroundThe Supreme Court of India has recently taken important strides towards protecting personal liberty and curbing indiscriminate exercise of power by the Directorate of Enforcement (“ED”). In a fresh judgment in Pankaj Bansal v. Union of India[1], the Supreme Court has criticised disparate procedures being used by various officers of the ED across the country while arresting a person accused of committing an offence under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, 2002 (“PMLA”), mandating that the provision of written grounds of arrest be provided to the arrested person as a matter of course and without exception.In the matter of Ashish Bhalla vs. State and Another[1](“Judgment”), the Hon’ble High Court of Delhi (“Court”) has recently ruled that once an investigation by the SFIO under Section 212 of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”) has been initiated, a parallel investigation by a separate investigating agency into the affairs of the company is not permissible, considering the bar under Section 212 of the 2013 Act (“Section 212”). While the Madras High Court in the matter of Ravi Parthasarathy and Others vs. State of Another[2] had made similar observations to sub-clause (2) of Section 212, its application had not been sufficiently visible.Introduction:The Reserve Bank of India (“RBI”) has proposed a transparent mechanism to identify and declare borrowers as Wilful Defaulters. The Central Bank issued the ‘Draft Master Direction on Treatment of Wilful Defaulters and Large Defaulters’ (“Master Direction” or “Direction”) on September 21, 2023, on which stakeholder comments have been invited till October 31, 2023.An arbitral award can be challenged by filing an application under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (“Act”). Ordinarily, along with the application to set aside an arbitral award, another application is filed under Section 36(2) of the Act seeking a stay on the operation of the award. Prior to the amendment to the Act in the year 2015, mere filing of an application under Section 34 of the Act would lead to an automatic stay on the enforcement of the award. However, pursuant to the Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015, Section 36(2) was amended to state that filing of an application to set aside an arbitral award shall not by itself render the award unenforceable and a specific order of stay of operation of the award shall have to be granted on a separate application being made for that purpose. Upon the filing of a separate application, seeking a stay on the operation of the arbitral award, the court may grant the stay, while imposing certain conditions, as it may deem fit. These conditions could entail either furnishing a bank guarantee or depositing cash with the court, to secure the arbitral award. The form and quantum of the security depends on the facts and circumstances of each case and is typically driven by the financial wherewithal and the conduct of the judgment debtor.The Bombay High Court was recently called upon to decide an application filed by Anupam Mittal (“Applicant”), the founder of shaadi.com, seeking to restrain Westbridge Ventures II Investment Holdings and other directors of People Interactive (India) Private Limited (“Respondents”) from enforcing an anti-suit injunction granted by the High Court of Singapore. The anti-suit injunction restrained the Applicant from proceeding with his oppression and mismanagement petition before the National Company Law Tribunal (“NCLT”) on the ground that parties had agreed to resolve their disputes via arbitration seated in Singapore and disputes pertaining to oppression and mismanagement were arbitrable under Singapore law.IntroductionDissolution of a Partnership under The Indian Partnership Act, 1932, “Partnership Act” can have far-reaching consequences, affecting not only the erstwhile partners but also related third parties. The process of dissolution involves activities such as settling of accounts, concluding of on-going business matters, discharging the Partnership firm’s liabilities and finally, distributing any remaining assets among the partners basis their respective shares. The Limitation Act, 1963 provides a period of three years from the date of dissolution within which  the parties can agitate their claims arising from the dissolution and winding up of the firm[1]. The period of limitation rests on the notion that the date of dissolution marks the conclusion of the firm’s winding-up process and settling of the rights and liabilities of the affected parties. However, is dissolution synonymous with winding up of the firm? Can erstwhile partners not have a right to agitate their claims post the period of three years if the process of winding-up could not be completed within the timeframe? Pertinently, through this blog, we aim to analyse whether any claims surviving the period of three years, which have been left unadjudicated are deadwood or can be brought under the period of limitation and give rise to a continuing cause of action."

    "data": "Context‘What would constitute an ‘undertaking’ of a company’ has been among the most hotly debated topics in the history of India’s company law regime. This question arises while evaluating whether a transaction falls within the purview of Section 180(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 2013 (“2013 Act”), which corresponds to Section 293(1)(a) of the Companies Act, 1956 (“1956 Act”).Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act provides that shareholders’ approval by a special resolution is required to sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or substantially the whole of the undertaking of the company or where the company owns more than one undertaking, of the whole or substantially the whole of any such undertakings. Section 180(1)(a) is applicable to public limited companies, with the MCA exempting private companies from complying with the requirements of Section 180[1].While neither Section 180(1)(a) nor Section 293(1)(a) of the 1956 Act define the expression ‘undertaking’ – there is one important difference between Section 180(1)(a) and Section 293(1)(a).Section 180(1)(a) now provides numerical criteria to determine what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, by stating the following:The introduction of the above numerical criteria was expected to resolve all the ambiguities surrounding the scope and meaning of ‘undertaking’. However, it has proven to be insufficient as the provision is silent on whether ‘undertaking’ should be construed in a watertight sense (to only include the entire business/ division/ unit, on a going concern basis), or liberally, to include even individual assets that meet the numerical criteria.While there are a host of contentious issues under Section 180(1)(a), an important one that companies grapple with frequently is whether ‘sale of shares’ would constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a). In this blog, the authors delve deeper into this issue, and argue why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a).Legislative BackgroundIn the Indian context, the requirement to obtain shareholder approval for sale/ disposal of an undertaking has its genesis in Section 86H of the Indian Companies Act, 1913, which provided that the directors of a public company (or a subsidiary of a public company), shall not, except with the consent of the company in a general meeting, sell or dispose off the undertaking of the company.The Bhabha Committee Report (which led to the introduction of the 1956 Act) recommended that along with ‘sale’ and ‘disposal’ of an undertaking, even ‘leasing’ should be brought within the purview of shareholders’ approval[2]. The rationale was that as the company would be formed inter alia for working the undertaking, even leasing of the undertaking should require shareholders’ approval.A reading of the Bhabha Committee Report highlights the original legislative intent, where ‘undertaking’ was envisaged to cover a transfer of a business/unit/division on a going concern basis only, and would not include transfer of individual assets that are held or owned by the company. It is also interesting to note that while the provisions of the 1956 Act were substantially borrowed from the English Companies Act, 1948 (“1948 English Act”), Section 293(1)(a) did not directly resemble any provision of the 1948 English Act.Further, specifically in the legislative context of the 2013 Act, while the Irani Committee Report (2005) notes that “certain additional items that should require shareholders’ approval may include sale/transfer of investment in equity shares of other bodies corporate which constitute 20% or more of the total assets of the investing company”[3] – this recommendation has not been expressly incorporated into the scheme of Section 180(1)(a).The Parliamentary Standing Committee Reports of 2010 and 2012 (which threadbare discusses various new provisions later inserted by the 2013 Act) also do not in any way provide that ‘undertaking’ should be read expansively to cover transfer of individual assets held or owned by the company.In fact, interestingly, the English Companies Act, 2006[4], and its predecessor Act of 1985[5] define ‘undertaking’ in an even narrower sense, to only include (a) body corporate or partnership, or (b) an unincorporated association carrying on a trade or business, with or without a view to profit.A view may accordingly be taken that in the absence of a specific deeming provision stating that ‘shares’ would constitute an ‘undertaking’ for the purpose of Section 180(1)(a), it can be argued that sale/ disposal of shares, exceeding the numerical threshold prescribed under Section 180(1)(a), would not be deemed to be a sale/ disposal of an ‘undertaking’ of the company.Whether ‘shares’ constitute an ‘undertaking’ – Case Law JurisprudenceIn view of the above legislative background, it is also instructive to refer to case law jurisprudence, which also suggests that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’. In Brooke Bond India Limited v. U. B. Limited and Others[6], the Bombay High Court held that “…the sale of shares, whatever be their number, even if it amounts to a transfer of the controlling interest of a company, cannot be equated to the sale of any part of the “undertaking” so as to come within the mischief of section 293(1)(a)”.In Rustom Cavasjee Cooper v. Union of India[7], the Supreme Court of India (“SC”) distinguished between an ‘undertaking’ and individual assets that constitute the undertaking, stating as follows – ““undertaking” clearly means a going concern with all its rights, liabilities and assets as distinct from the various rights and assets which compose it… the undertaking means the entire organization… it is an amalgam of all ingredients of property and are not capable of being dismembered… That would destroy the essence and innate character of the undertaking…..”.In P. S. Offshore Inter Land Services Pvt. Ltd. and another vs. Bombay Offshore Suppliers and Services Ltd. and others[8], the Bombay HC had provided an asset-based test for determining what would constitute an ‘undertaking’, stating as follows:“…… the expression “undertaking” used in this section is liable to be interpreted to mean “the unit”, the business as a going concern, the activity of the company duly integrated with all its components in the form of assets and not merely some asset of the undertaking…”.In Commissioner of Income Tax v. UTV Software Communication Limited[9], Bombay HC had provided the distinction between “transfer of shares” and “transfer of an undertaking”, in the context of the Income Tax Act, 1961 (“Income Tax Act”), stating that the transfer of shares cannot be considered to be a slump sale of an undertaking under Section 2(42C) of the Income Tax Act. Reference was made to the SC decisions in Vodafone International Holdings BV v. Union of India[10] (“Vodafone”) and Bacha F. Guzdar v. CIT[11](“Bacha F Guzdar”), which reiterate the cardinal principle that since a company is a separate legal person in the eyes of law, a shareholder does not exercise ownership interest over the assets of the company.In Tracstar Investments Limited and Another v. Gordon Woodroffe Limited and Others[12], the Company Law Board (“CLB”) held that: “The main object of the company is not even to engage in the business of investing in shares. Consequently, the disposal of these shares would not bring the business of the company to a standstill. Thus, the sale of the shares does not certainly pass through the test prescribed…”.In an interesting decision in Gujrat NRE Mineral Resources Ltd. v SEBI[13], the Securities Appellate Tribunal, in the context of the definition of unpublished price sensitive information (UPSI) under the PIT Regulations, 1992, held that the words: “disposal of the whole or substantial part of the undertaking”…would mean when a company decides to dispose of the whole or substantial part of its business activity or project in which it is engaged. The word ‘undertaking’ cannot possibly mean investments held by an investment company which are its stock-in-trade” (“Gujarat NRE Case”).The Gujarat NRE Case supports the view that ‘sale of shares’ would not constitute ‘sale of an undertaking’ even for an investment company, which acquires/ sells shares in its ordinary course of business, and whose assets predominantly comprise of its holdings in other investee companies. Even if the investment company has a controlling stake in the investee company, pursuant to the SC decisions in Vodafone and Bacha Guzdar, its shareholding will be considered as distinct from the undertaking/ assets of the investee – and the investment company would not exercise ownership interest over the undertaking/ assets.Additional Considerations for Listed CompaniesThe recently introduced Regulation 37A of the SEBI (Listing Obligations and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2015 (“LODR Regulations”), provides that shareholders’ approval by special resolution, along with consent of the ‘majority of minority shareholders’ of the listed entity is required in case of sale/lease/disposal of an undertaking/ substantially the whole of the undertaking by a listed company. Given that Regulation 37A provides that the expressions ‘undertaking’ and ‘substantially the whole of the undertaking’ shall have the same meaning as assigned to them under Section 180(1)(a) of the 2013 Act – the above analysis on why ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ will also be applicable in this context.However, it may be noted that as per Regulation 24(5) of the LODR Regulations, a listed entity shall not dispose of shares in its material subsidiary, resulting in reduction of its shareholding (either on its own or together with other subsidiaries) to less than or equal to 50% or cease the exercise of control over the subsidiary without passing a special resolution in its general meeting. The requirement to obtain shareholders’ approval (by special resolution) in the above scenario is an independent compliance requirement applicable to listed entities. Further, listed companies are also required to examine implications under Regulation 24(6), which provides that selling, disposing and leasing of assets amounting to more than 20% of the assets of the material subsidiary on an aggregate basis during a financial year shall require prior approval of shareholders by special resolution.Concluding ThoughtsBasis the case law jurisprudence and the legislative context discussed above, there are strong legal grounds to take a view that ‘shares’ would not constitute an ‘undertaking’ under Section 180(1)(a), and the law therefore does not mandate shareholders’ approval by special resolution in case of sale/ disposal of shares exceeding the numerical criteria prescribed under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a).Unfortunately, given that Section 180(1)(a) does not provide a specific definition of the nature/type of assets that would constitute an ‘undertaking’ – the introduction of numerical criteria under the Explanation to Section 180(1)(a) has failed to settle the long-standing debate on the precise scope and ambit of the term ‘undertaking’ under the said Section. The ambiguities surrounding the precise scope and ambit of what would constitute an ‘undertaking’ is yet another example of how inadequate drafting of various provisions of the 2013 Act has resulted in unforeseen interpretative challenges, along with the lack of consistency in the practices followed by India Inc.For ensuring consistency in the practices followed by companies the MCA should, in the next round of amendments to the 2013 Act, consider inserting an Explanation to Section 180(1)(a), to clarify that ‘shares’ would not ‘constitute’ an ‘undertaking’  and issue a clarification in the interim to facilitate the ease of doing business in India.[1] MCA Notification No. GSR 464(E), dated June 5, 2015.[2] Report of the Bhabha Committee on Company Law, 1952, at Paras 102 and 104 of the said report.[3] Report of the Expert Committee on Company Law, chaired by Dr. Jamshed J.

The Central Government, pursuant to its powers under Section 227 of IBC, had notified Insolvency and Bankruptcy (Insolvency and Liquidation Proceedings of Financial Service Providers and Application to Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 2019 (“FSP Rules”) for resolving specified non-banking financial companies (“Specified NBFCs”) registered with the Reserve Bank of India.[1]The Department for Promotion of Industry and Internal Trade (“DPIIT”) released a new standard operating procedure for processing foreign direct investment (“FDI”) proposals on August 17, 2023 (“New SOP”)[1]. It replaced the erstwhile standard operating procedure dated November 9, 2020 (“Erstwhile SOP”)[2], which covered the manner in which FDI proposals that required government approval under the Consolidated FDI Policy 2020 (“FDI Policy”) and the Foreign Exchange Management (Non-Debt Instruments) Rules, 2019, were being processed.            Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) can generate and manipulate our ideas and thinking by creating human-like content via non-human intelligence.[1] These software(s) such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT/ GPT-4, Google’s BARD, inter alia, are initially trained on a large data sets and computing power. After the training, they are capable of self-enhancement to generate unique and personalised content.[2] This has posed novel questions before the copyright experts, as content generation, previously reliant on human inputs, has moved beyond that realm. Now, instead of answers based on user queries – as obtained via Google’s search engine – customized personal content is delivered to the user. Creation of this new content through GenAI has led to concerns on copyright infringement, privacy violation, libel and defamation, etc. Copyright infringement is particularly worrisome as the companies are using the user-generated data to train these software(s), which includes the data generated by minors, amplifying their vulnerability. Questions arise regarding the extent to which the companies can claim ‘fair-use’ exception of the Copyright Act? This article attempts to bring some clarity over these issues. It incorporates two landmark US cases against OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc., respectively[3], and their implications in India, including the India’s recently-passed Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023.Increasing the role and relevance of ‘Proxy Advisory Firms’ in corporate governanceUntil very recently, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms did not impact companies much, as it did not have the power to influence or fail/ stop a resolution from being passed. However now, the recommendations of proxy advisory firms are becoming increasingly relevant given that many institutional investors are basing their positions while voting on resolutions on such advice. This is evidenced from the fact that a proxy advisory firms have recently managed to prevent a resolution for granting employee stock options to employees of a group entity of a very large Indian bank from being passed due to the absence of “any compelling reasons”.[1] In another interesting case, a proxy advisory firm came very close to preventing a resolution pertaining to an increase in the remuneration of a director from being passed on account of this increase being “skewed” and “guaranteed”.[2]Introduction:The objective of the PIT Regulations is to prohibit insiders with access to Unpublished Price Sensitive Information (“UPSI”) from making illicit gains and to ensure timely, adequate and even disclosure of UPSI to the public. Hence, the determination of what constitutes as UPSI becomes necessary. In this regard, the Securities and Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has signalled a shift from a principle-based regime to a more prescriptive regime, which is likely to result in increased compliance obligations for the listed companies.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) issued a notification on October 03, 2023 under Section 14(3)(a) of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code, 2016 (“IBC”), exempting the applicability of moratorium under Section 14(1) of the IBC to transactions, arrangements or agreements under the Cape Town Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment (“Convention”) and the Protocol to the Convention on International Interests in Mobile Equipment on Matters Specific to Aircraft Equipment (“Protocol”) (the “Notification”).On August 11, 2023, India’s long-awaited general personal data protection legislation, the Digital Personal Data Protection Act, 2023 (“DPDPA”) was finally enacted.Governing the world’s fifth largest economy and one of its fastest growing digital markets, the DPDPA will be of importance to a large number of international businesses that operate in India, rely on Indian service providers/group service companies for their operations, or are looking to enter Indian markets.IntroductionThe division bench of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court recently agreed with the findings of the single judge of the Hon’ble Delhi High Court in Google LLC Vs.

    "data": "Litigation centred around ‘maintenance’ remains an abrasive subject for litigants. For the courts, it is usually a mixed question of law and facts. However, at times, the issues involve an exercise in statutory interpretation. Recently, the Hon’ble Delhi High Court[1] ruled that a ‘divorced daughter’ cannot claim maintenance from her brother or her mother. The rationale being that a divorced daughter does not qualify as a ‘Dependent’ under Section 21 of the Hindu Adoption and Maintenance Act, 1956 (“HAMA” or the “Act”). The Hon’ble Delhi High Court, in this case, was sitting in appeal over a judgement of the Ld. Judge, Family Court, South-East Saket, New Delhi (“Saket Family Court”), which had dismissed the appellant’s plaint. As the Hon’ble Delhi High Court refused to set aside the judgement of the Saket Family Court, in the process, it clarified the law on maintenance to divorced daughters in India. An overview of the law in respect of maintenance under the HAMA may provide a useful background to the issues involved in this lis.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 12th September, 2023.

My father wishes that the said property or realizable value thereof may be shared equally by both the children. What is the suitable, tax-friendly method of achieving this division of property? One simple way could be that my father signs a deed of relinquishment before the mutation of the property.

While every country has a CSR regime, the Indian CSR regime is unique due to its distinctive departure from the voluntary nature, which is one of the core aspects of a CSR framework. India is the only country in the world which has made both, the spending and reporting of CSR obligations mandatory. The new CSR regime notified by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) on January 22, 2021 brought about a fundamental shift from the erstwhile ‘comply or explain’ regime to a mandatory CSR regime. This includes specific obligations relating to CSR fund disbursement, ‘utilisation’ of disbursed funds, monitoring and evaluation.The Securities Exchange Board of India (“SEBI”) has been actively updating the SEBI (Alternative Investment Funds) Regulations, 2012 (“AIF Regulations”) to strengthen the governance mechanism of alternative investment funds (“AIFs”) and bring in more transparency and accountability for market participants. The recent updates seem to be aimed at investor protection and ensuring compliance with the existing array of laws related to AIF Regulations.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 30th May, 2023.

Can I send the money through a private trust?—Name withheld on requestIt is trite law that a personal action or claim extinguishes with the death of a person. This principle has been appropriately captured in the common law maxim – “action personalismoritur cum persona”, which is the Latin equivalent for “a personal right of action dies with the person”. The maxim, however, has limited application on cases, such as (i) a defamatory action, (ii) criminal proceedings in lieu of personal injury not amounting to murder, (iii) where the grant of any relief in a suit would be nugatory owing to the death of a party, etc. However, where a judgement debtor dies before fully satisfying a money payment decree, the decree holder can apply to the court that had passed the decree to get the decree executed against the legal representatives and/ or legal heirs of the deceased judgement debtor. Here, the above mentioned common law maxim has no application. In this paper, we will discuss the extent of liability of a legal heir in such a situation where the judgement debtor has expired before the execution of a money decree.The following article was first published in the Mint newspaper on 29th March, 2023.

Is it any different from a regular will?—Name withheld on requestA living will is a written legal document that individuals can execute during their lifetime, whereby they can specify whether they shall or shall not be given medical treatment in the future if they become terminally ill. It does not deal with the disposal of any property, either during one’s lifetime or after death. On the other hand, a last will and testament is a formal, legal declaration of the intention of individuals with respect to their property which they desire to be carried into effect after their death—strict formalities apply to its execution and implementation.“I’m not saying I’d make a better CEO. That’s unsaid.” – Connor RoyAt the time of publication, we are just a few days away from the release of the final season of HBO’s highly acclaimed family business drama, Succession. For many viewers in India, the show’s portrayal of the perils and tribulations of running a family business hits uncomfortably close to home. Many would say this show is an example of art imitating life. Others may see it as a docudrama about their family business. It is a poignant example of what can happen without a clear succession plan, and it packages together many common issues faced by many Indian family businesses – such as an aging founder who is unwilling to cede control or induct his middle aged children, a failure to modernize (as seen in many older media houses that are going through similar existential dilemmas), siblings squabbling for the CEO role, and a founder family & business enthralled in multiple full-blown crises."

    "data": "The Most Favored Nation ClauseA Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) with one country might have a different treatment for the same income as compared to DTAA with another country. To ensure that such differential treatment is avoided, and similar benefits are available across different DTAAs, DTAAs may include the Most Favored Nation (“MFN”) clause. The MFN clause is not a part of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development’s (“OECD”) or the United Nation’s model tax conventions and is also not a standard clause of all DTAAs. Such a clause can be negotiated and included at the discretion of the contracting states for certain income (typically investment income).BackgroundThe Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) contains various machinery provisions which enable tax authorities to recover tax dues from taxpayers. When payments are made to non-residents that are chargeable to tax under the IT Act, payers (both resident and non-resident) are obligated to withhold tax at applicable rates prior to remittance of funds. Typically, no such obligation arises if the payments are not subject to tax in India. Thus, there are times when taxpayers don’t withhold tax on payments, believing they should not be subject to tax under the IT Act. However, if the Indian tax authorities take a different view, they may initiate proceedings under section 201 of the IT Act against such taxpayers, i.e., the person responsible for withholding taxes.The ITAT recently dismissed an appeal and slammed Cognizant India Private Limited (“Cognizant India”) for what it perceived as  using a colorable device to evade taxes during its INR 190 billion share buyback exercise.Despite India being the third[1] largest domestic aviation market in the world, a majority of the aircrafts in the country (more than 70% approximately) are procured through lease arrangements, with most of them being provided by overseas lessors. Airline companies do not have the financial wherewithal to purchase aircrafts and hence, are forced to take them on lease. However, since the aircraft financing industry is at a nascent stage in India and considering the risks involved, new players are unwilling to enter the business. While leasing aircrafts helps to manage the liquidity position of aircraft operating companies, it comes at a heavy cost and significant financial risks for aircraft operating companies and creates huge trade imbalance for the country.The Goods and Services Tax (“GST”) legislation has recently completed its sixth anniversary. The 50th GST Council meeting conducted on July 11, 2023 was marked by tax rate changes, availability of exemptions, procedural amendments, etc. It is noteworthy that the GST Council is proactively considering representations and feedback from all quarters of the industry. While the Government has been persistent in its efforts to iron out all creases, bottlenecks continue to exist. It was also expected that several sectors, including online gaming, would get relaxation – that the GST authorities would simplify the law, avoid unnecessary ambiguities, but in reality, it appears that on certain fronts, it has merely focussed on increasing sources of tax collection.The Bombay High Court has recently allowed a writ, challenging a reassessment notice served on the Assessee (by the income tax department) for FY11-12 on share premium issued by it. The assessing officer, however, failed to come up with any reasonable grounds that led him to believe that income had escaped assessment during the relevant FY. Section 56(2)(viib) was introduced into the (Indian) Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) as an anti-abuse provision with effect from FY12-13, according to which, if a company issues shares at a value higher than its fair market value, then it will have to pay tax (angel tax) on such incremental value. Rule 11UA of the (Indian) Income Tax Rules, 1962 (“IT Rules”) provides mechanism for computing fair market value.The Hon’ble Income Tax Appellate Tribunal (“ITAT”), Delhi has recently held that salary reimbursement of seconded employees paid to the original employer without any profit element is not taxable as fee for technical services.This case[1] pertains to Ernst and Young LLP, USA (“EY USA”), which is set up in the US. It had sent its employees on secondment (“Seconded Personnel”) to work with various EY member firms in India (“EY India”). During the assessment proceedings, the tax officer held that the cost-to-cost reimbursement of salary of Seconded Personnel is taxable as fee for technical services (“FTS”) as per Article 12 of the India-US Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement (“DTAA”) in the hands of EY USA.In the case of Manas Vs. Income Tax Officer[1], the Hon’ble Madras High Court (“HC”) took serious objection to the taxpayer’s attempt at misleading the Court. The taxpayer had filed a writ petition seeking quashing of the reassessment proceedings and satisfaction order passed under Section 148A of Income Tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”).Section 48 of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (“IT Act”) provides the computation mechanism for capital gains arising to a taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of a capital asset.[1] The said provision, inter alia, permits non-resident taxpayers to account for foreign currency fluctuation while computing capital gains arising from the transfer of shares or debentures of an Indian company. However, where capital gains arise to a non-resident taxpayer pursuant to the transfer of unlisted securities or shares of a private company, section 112(1)(c)(iii) of the IT Act provides that such capital gains should be computed without giving effect to any foreign currency fluctuations. A concessional tax rate of 10% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) is available on such gains. Section 112(1)(c)(ii) of the IT Act, on the other hand, provides a higher tax rate of 20% (plus applicable surcharge and cess) on any other long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (i.e., other than gains arising from transfer of unlisted securities or shares) while, inter alia, allowing foreign currency fluctuation benefits to such non-residents.In an upsetting ruling, the Hyderabad ITAT in Vertex Projects LLP[1] has held that even in a court approved merger, the resulting company will have to pay taxes if the assets of the merging companies were transferred to it for less than fair market value."

The Draft M&A Regulations would replace the current CCI (Procedure in regard to the transactions of business relating to combinations) Regulations, 2011 (Combinations Regulations, 2011).2022 was an eventful year for competition law in India. The Competition Commission of India (CCI) operated optimally approving combinations notified before it in reasonable timelines, conducting significant dawn raids, passing notable orders that made international headlines, and conducting market studies. The anticipated amendments to the Competition Act, 2002 (Act) were discussed ad nauseum in conference rooms and across coffee tables. Notable also is that the CCI has not had quorum for the formal conduct of business since Chairperson, Mr. Ashok Gupta demitted office on 24 October 2022, which has resulted in deals worth billions stuck without clearance.On 19 October 2022, the Competition Commission of India (the CCI) imposed heavy penalties[1] on MakeMyTrip India Private Limited (MMT) and Ibibo Group Private Limited (collectively, MMT-Go) and directed MMT-Go to, inter alia, modify its agreements with hotels to remove parity and exclusivity related obligations. Legitimacy of price parity clauses (also referred to as ‘best-price’ or ‘most favoured nation’ or MFN clauses) has been one of the highly debated ‘modern’ antitrust issues across many jurisdictions.The Ministry of Corporate Affairs (“MCA”) has extended the suspension of the 30-day deadline for merger filings India’s competition regime is mandatory and suspensory.

USD 27 million) for restricting and controlling the discounts offered by its dealers to the end consumers. Such conduct by India’s leading passenger vehicle manufacturer was held to be anti-competitive resale price maintenance (RPM), and thus violative of the provisions of the Competition Act, 2002 (as amended) (Competition Act).

Around the same time, the EU also agreed to restart negotiations on a potential FTA with India. In this second part, let’s discuss the prospects and challenges of a potential FTA between India and the EU. Continue Reading International Trade: Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 2Last month, the UK and the EU separately announced their intention to negotiate a free trade agreement (FTA) with India. This is a significant development, not only from an international trade perspective, but also from geo-politics perspective. For India, FTAs with the UK and the EU have the potential of integrating it with the dominant global value chain of trade, and for the UK and the EU, FTAs with India would not only provide them an enhanced access to one of the largest and fastest growing markets as well as manufacturing hubs in the world, ensuring supply chain resilience, but would also enhance their economic and political influence in the Indo-Pacific region. Continue Reading Analysing India’s potential free trade agreements with the UK and the EU – Part 1The Competition Commission of India (CCI) adapted nimbly to the challenges of 2020 and focused on digital payment platforms and cartel investigations; a few merger cases threw up interesting results as well.
