    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial. Analyze the implications of the court’s view on extrajudicial confessions and propose a strategy for the defence team to address this aspect during the trial.Options:a) The defence should argue that extrajudicial confessions, even when retracted, are strong evidence and need no further corroboration.b) Considering the court’s stance, the defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.c) The defence can challenge the court’s view, arguing that retractions during trial should not impact the admissibility and reliability of extrajudicial confessions.d) Extrajudicial confessions should be the primary focus of the defence, with minimal emphasis on corroboration, as per the court’s interpretation.e) The defence should avoid relying on extrajudicial confessions altogether, given the court’s scepticism about their reliability.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das. Discuss the court’s stance on such recoveries and provide recommendations on how this aspect could be addressed or contested in future legal proceedings involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) Analysing the court’s view, it is evident that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.c) Given the lack of clarity in the court’s treatment, future cases should avoid relying on recoveries made from an open place as a crucial piece of evidence.d) The court’s perspective indicates that recoveries from an open place are only relevant if there is direct evidence of the accused’s involvement in the crime, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the significance of recoveries made from an open place in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view suggests that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.Question 6: You are advising the prosecution team in a similar case to Indrajit Das. The defence has raised concerns about the credibility of the last-seen theory presented by the prosecution. Evaluate the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in Indrajit Das’s case and suggest how the prosecution could address or strengthen this aspect in future cases.Options:a) The court’s treatment of the last-seen theory is irrelevant, and the prosecution should focus on other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial, and the prosecution should present direct testimonies to reinforce its credibility.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment, the prosecution should avoid relying on the last-seen theory in future cases.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding the prosecution to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for the prosecution to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das. Discuss the court’s stance on such recoveries and provide recommendations on how this aspect could be addressed or contested in future legal proceedings involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) Analysing the court’s view, it is evident that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.c) Given the lack of clarity in the court’s treatment, future cases should avoid relying on recoveries made from an open place as a crucial piece of evidence.d) The court’s perspective indicates that recoveries from an open place are only relevant if there is direct evidence of the accused’s involvement in the crime, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the significance of recoveries made from an open place in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view suggests that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.Question 6: You are advising the prosecution team in a similar case to Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v.

Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das. Discuss the court’s stance on such recoveries and provide recommendations on how this aspect could be addressed or contested in future legal proceedings involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) Analysing the court’s view, it is evident that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.c) Given the lack of clarity in the court’s treatment, future cases should avoid relying on recoveries made from an open place as a crucial piece of evidence.d) The court’s perspective indicates that recoveries from an open place are only relevant if there is direct evidence of the accused’s involvement in the crime, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the significance of recoveries made from an open place in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view suggests that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.Question 6: You are advising the prosecution team in a similar case to Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments.

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial. Analyze the implications of the court’s view on extrajudicial confessions and propose a strategy for the defence team to address this aspect during the trial.Options:a) The defence should argue that extrajudicial confessions, even when retracted, are strong evidence and need no further corroboration.b) Considering the court’s stance, the defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.c) The defence can challenge the court’s view, arguing that retractions during trial should not impact the admissibility and reliability of extrajudicial confessions.d) Extrajudicial confessions should be the primary focus of the defence, with minimal emphasis on corroboration, as per the court’s interpretation.e) The defence should avoid relying on extrajudicial confessions altogether, given the court’s scepticism about their reliability.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v.

Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das. Discuss the court’s stance on such recoveries and provide recommendations on how this aspect could be addressed or contested in future legal proceedings involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) Analysing the court’s view, it is evident that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.c) Given the lack of clarity in the court’s treatment, future cases should avoid relying on recoveries made from an open place as a crucial piece of evidence.d) The court’s perspective indicates that recoveries from an open place are only relevant if there is direct evidence of the accused’s involvement in the crime, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the significance of recoveries made from an open place in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view suggests that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.Question 6: You are advising the prosecution team in a similar case to Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments.

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial. Analyze the implications of the court’s view on extrajudicial confessions and propose a strategy for the defence team to address this aspect during the trial.Options:a) The defence should argue that extrajudicial confessions, even when retracted, are strong evidence and need no further corroboration.b) Considering the court’s stance, the defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.c) The defence can challenge the court’s view, arguing that retractions during trial should not impact the admissibility and reliability of extrajudicial confessions.d) Extrajudicial confessions should be the primary focus of the defence, with minimal emphasis on corroboration, as per the court’s interpretation.e) The defence should avoid relying on extrajudicial confessions altogether, given the court’s scepticism about their reliability.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v.

Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das. Discuss the court’s stance on such recoveries and provide recommendations on how this aspect could be addressed or contested in future legal proceedings involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) Analysing the court’s view, it is evident that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.c) Given the lack of clarity in the court’s treatment, future cases should avoid relying on recoveries made from an open place as a crucial piece of evidence.d) The court’s perspective indicates that recoveries from an open place are only relevant if there is direct evidence of the accused’s involvement in the crime, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the significance of recoveries made from an open place in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view suggests that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.Question 6: You are advising the prosecution team in a similar case to Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments.

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial. Analyze the implications of the court’s view on extrajudicial confessions and propose a strategy for the defence team to address this aspect during the trial.Options:a) The defence should argue that extrajudicial confessions, even when retracted, are strong evidence and need no further corroboration.b) Considering the court’s stance, the defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.c) The defence can challenge the court’s view, arguing that retractions during trial should not impact the admissibility and reliability of extrajudicial confessions.d) Extrajudicial confessions should be the primary focus of the defence, with minimal emphasis on corroboration, as per the court’s interpretation.e) The defence should avoid relying on extrajudicial confessions altogether, given the court’s scepticism about their reliability.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v.

Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das. Discuss the court’s stance on such recoveries and provide recommendations on how this aspect could be addressed or contested in future legal proceedings involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) Analysing the court’s view, it is evident that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.c) Given the lack of clarity in the court’s treatment, future cases should avoid relying on recoveries made from an open place as a crucial piece of evidence.d) The court’s perspective indicates that recoveries from an open place are only relevant if there is direct evidence of the accused’s involvement in the crime, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the significance of recoveries made from an open place in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view suggests that recoveries made in an open place hold significant relevance, and legal strategies should focus on establishing the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons regarding these recoveries.Question 6: You are advising the prosecution team in a similar case to Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments.

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

    "data": "Preparing for CLAT PG 2024? Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial. Analyze the implications of the court’s view on extrajudicial confessions and propose a strategy for the defence team to address this aspect during the trial.Options:a) The defence should argue that extrajudicial confessions, even when retracted, are strong evidence and need no further corroboration.b) Considering the court’s stance, the defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.c) The defence can challenge the court’s view, arguing that retractions during trial should not impact the admissibility and reliability of extrajudicial confessions.d) Extrajudicial confessions should be the primary focus of the defence, with minimal emphasis on corroboration, as per the court’s interpretation.e) The defence should avoid relying on extrajudicial confessions altogether, given the court’s scepticism about their reliability.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

The defence should acknowledge the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, as highlighted by the court, and focus on presenting alternative forms of evidence to strengthen the case.Question 4: As a legal expert, you are asked to analyse the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory in the case of Kaushik Sarkar’s disappearance. Evaluate the court’s interpretation of the last-seen theory and suggest how this concept could be strategically utilised or challenged in future cases involving circumstantial evidence.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of the last seen theory is irrelevant in circumstantial evidence cases, and future strategies should prioritise other aspects of the case.b) The last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.c) Given the ambiguity in the court’s treatment of the last-seen theory, future cases should avoid relying on this concept altogether.d) The court’s interpretation indicates that the last-seen theory is only relevant in cases with direct evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct testimonies.e) The court’s view on the last-seen theory is unclear, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret and apply it based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s interpretation suggests that the last-seen theory is crucial in establishing guilt, and legal strategies should focus on strengthening this aspect to ensure a more robust circumstantial case.Question 5: You are tasked with preparing a legal brief on the court’s treatment of recoveries made from an open place in the case of Indrajit Das.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on the Principles of Natural Justice",
    "data": "IntroductionPrinciples of natural justice are fundamental legal concepts designed to ensure fairness and justice in administrative, quasi-judicial, and judicial proceedings. These principles form the cornerstone of a just legal system, providing safeguards against arbitrary actions and ensuring a fair decision-making process.The two main principles of natural justice are the principles of audi alteram partem (hear the other side) and nemo judex in causa sua (no one should be a judge in his own cause).Principles of Natural JusticeThis principle basically means ‘hear the other side’.  emphasizes that no person should be condemned unheard. It ensures that all parties involved in a legal proceeding have the right to present their case, respond to the opposing party’s arguments, and provide evidence.This principle is grounded in the idea that a fair decision can only be reached when all relevant information is considered. Failure to provide an opportunity for a fair hearing can lead to a decision being declared null and void.The gist of this principle is ‘No one should be a judge in his own cause’. This principle is a fundamental tenet of natural justice and is a cornerstone of fair legal proceedings. It emphasizes the importance of impartiality and the avoidance of bias in judicial or quasi-judicial decision-making.The principle seeks to prevent situations where a person is both a participant in a dispute and the arbiter of that dispute. Such a scenario could compromise the fairness and objectivity of the decision. The principle is applicable not only in traditional judicial settings but also in administrative and quasi-judicial proceedings. It is a fundamental element of due process and the rule of law.“Justice should not only be done, but should manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done” is a well-known legal maxim that underscores the importance of not only ensuring the substance of justice but also making sure that the process is transparent and perceivably fair. This principle is fundamental to the concept of natural justice and is crucial for maintaining public trust and confidence in the legal system.The maxim implies that the judicial process should be conducted in a manner that avoids any appearance of bias, impropriety, or undue influence. This is essential for upholding the integrity of the legal system.Landmark Cases on Principle of Natural JusticeRidge v. Baldwin: The case highlighted the importance of audi alteram partem in the context of employment termination. The Chief Constable terminated the employment of a police officer without giving him an opportunity to be heard. The House of Lords held that the officer had a legitimate expectation of being heard before being dismissed, emphasizing the significance of fair procedures in employment matters.Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India: The case expanded the scope of Article 21 of the Indian Constitution, emphasizing the right to life and personal liberty. The court held that the procedure established by law under Article 21 must be fair, just, and reasonable. This decision reinforced the principles of natural justice in the Indian legal system.Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works: The case contributed to the development of the nemo judex in causa sua principle. The defendant, a member of a local board, was involved in a case where the board imposed a fine. The court held that a person who is a party to a proceeding cannot act as a judge in the same matter, emphasizing the need for impartiality in decision-making.A.K. Kraipak v. Union of India: The case emphasized the importance of the rule against bias in administrative proceedings. The court held that a decision-maker must be unbiased and not have a personal interest in the outcome of the case. This decision reinforced the nemo judex in causa sua principle in administrative law.State of Orissa v. Dr. (Miss) Binapani Dei: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in administrative actions affecting individuals. The court held that the principles of natural justice apply not only to quasi-judicial bodies but also to administrative authorities making decisions that affect the rights of individuals. The right to a fair hearing is a basic requirement of justice.Mohinder Singh Gill v. Chief Election Commissioner: The case reinforced the audi alteram partem principle in the context of electoral disputes. The court emphasized that the principles of natural justice apply even in administrative actions that are not quasi-judicial in nature. It underscored the importance of providing a fair hearing before taking adverse actions.ConclusionPrinciples of natural justice are integral to the legal systems of many countries, serving as a safeguard against arbitrary decisions and upholding the principles of fairness and justice. These principles ensure that individuals have a fair opportunity to present their case, and decision-makers act without bias, contributing to the overall legitimacy of legal processes.For more Notes on Administrative Law, click here!"

    "headline": "Concept of Immovable Property under the Transfer of Property Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionProperty that is immovable typically refers to assets that cannot be easily moved and are permanently attached to land. Section 3 of the Act defines immovable property. Legal definitions vary but generally include land, structures, benefits from land, and certain rights. These definitions are not exhaustive.For example, the Transfer of Property Act excludes standing timber, growing crops, and grass from the definition of immovable property. The Registration Act adds further details, encompassing lands, buildings, rights, and more, while excluding standing timber, growing crops, and grass. Through the transfer of property law jurisprudence, it was established that “immovable” means permanently fixed and attached to land.Classification of Immovable PropertySection 6 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882 deals with what may be transferred. In India property that is immovable primarily includes land, benefits arising from land, and things attached to the earth, which can be classified into three categories:Things Rooted in the Earth: Trees, shrubs, herbs, and plants are considered immovable property unless detached or cut.Things Embedded in the Earth: Objects firmly fixed within the land become immovable property, but intention matters. Stacked stone blocks for a wall in a builder’s yard are movable, unlike those forming a wall.Attached to What is Embedded: Objects attached to immovable property for permanent beneficial enjoyment, like doors and windows, are immovable, provided the attachment is intended to be permanent. Items like fans and window blinds, although attached to a building, are not immovable property.Exceptions to Immovable PropertyDifferences between Immovable and Movable PropertyImmovable property, like land and buildings, is permanently affixed to land, requiring complex legal procedures for ownership transfer and affecting the land if moved, while movable property, such as personal belongings and machinery, can be easily relocated without altering its nature and typically involves simpler legal procedures for transfer.\nLandmark Judgements In the case of Shantabai v. State of Bombay, the issue was whether the right granted to the petitioner was a right in immovable or movable property. The court determined that the right to enter another’s land and derive benefits from it, such as cutting timber and trees, constituted an instance of “profits a prendre,” which is a benefit arising out of land and thus, a grant in immovable property.The court highlighted the distinction between timber trees and standing timber, emphasizing that the grant in question allowed the grantee to benefit from the soil itself, not just the trees. Since the right extended over 12 years and was created through an unregistered lease deed, the petitioner could not claim any remedy.In State of Himachal Pradesh v. Motilal Pratap Singh & Co, the court held that a contract to cut standing timber does not require registration, while a contract related to land with bamboo clumps and trees, not intended for immediate cutting, constitutes property that is not movable.In the case of Kapoor Construction v. Leela Nagaraj & Ors, it was established that three key factors, specifically, the intention behind the attachment, the method of attachment, and the extent of attachment, collectively determine whether a property is classified as movable or immovable.ConclusionImmovable property in India, as defined by various legal statutes, encompasses land, benefits arising from land, and things permanently attached to the earth. Exceptions within immovable property consist of standing timber, crops, and grass, which are categorized as movable property.These distinctions are pivotal in determining legal procedures for ownership transfer and various property-related matters, with complex processes often associated with property that is immovable due to its permanent nature, in contrast to the more straightforward procedures linked to movable property."

    "headline": "Relevancy of Facts under Indian Evidence Act",
    "data": "\nIntroductionThe term fact has been defined under Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act. Facts are either tangible realities, states of affairs, or relationships between things that can be observed and sensed by the human senses. Alternatively, they encompass any mental state or condition of consciousness that an individual is aware of. “Relevancy of Facts” serves as a mechanism for discerning pertinent facts that are pertinent to a given case. Not everything holds significance within a legal context; only specific occurrences, whether concrete or conceptual, that are presented to the court through proper legal procedures, possess relevance. Each incident inherently constitutes a fact and is composed of various individual details. The framework of evidentiary law was established to substantiate these ‘facts’.Requirements for RelevancyUnverified information should not be accepted for matters requiring proof.Admissibility depends on whether legal principles or policies exclude such information.Verified and probative evidence should be allowed unless explicitly prohibited.Relevancy acts as the connecting link between a statement for proof and the statement needing to be proven.Understanding Relevancy of Facts in comparison to AdmissibilityRelevancy encompasses a broader scope, signifying that facts connect in a way that makes the existence or non-existence of other facts likely according to common human behavior or events. It derives from logic and human experience and determines the connection between facts, acting as the cause. The court may exercise discretion in assessing relevance.In contrast, admissibility occurs when facts receive legal recognition as relevant under the Indian Evidence Act. It is narrower in scope and is grounded in specific legal provisions. Admissibility discerns between relevant facts that can be admitted as evidence and those that cannot, serving as the effect. The court has limited discretion in determining admissibility.The question regarding relevancy has been enunciated in Section 5 to Section 55 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 whereas, the question of admissibility is provided in Section 56 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.While all admissible evidence is relevant, not all relevant evidence is admissible in a court of law, as only legally relevant facts can be admitted. This distinction is crucial in the practice of evidence law.\nRelevant Sections of the ActThe Indian Evidence Act does not provide a specific definition for the terms “relevancy” or “relevant fact.” Instead, it essentially illustrates the circumstances under which one fact becomes pertinent to another. Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, defines “Evidence.” It encompasses statements or documents presented before the court by witnesses regarding matters under inquiry.This Code does not make a clear distinction between admissibility and relevancy.Section 5 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 stipulates that evidence is permissible in any legal case to establish the presence or absence of facts in contention, as well as other facts that are deemed relevant as outlined subsequently, and not beyond. The determination of relevance is grounded in principles of logic and likelihood, guiding the admissibility of evidence. Section 6 of the same Act states that facts not directly under consideration but intertwined with a relevant fact to the extent of constituting a unified event are also pertinent, whether they occurred concurrently or at distinct times and places. This encompasses both actions and omissions, which need not be continuous but should contribute to the broader context of the concerned transaction. The legal concept of “Res Gestae” is outlined in Section 6 of the Act, denoting an action or event.Sections 6 to 16 encompass facts closely connected to the issue, including causality, motive, and direct relevance. Confessions fall within the purview of Sections 17 to 31 of the Act, while Sections 40 to 44 pertain to the relevance of court judgments.Sections 45 to 51 address when third-party opinions can be considered relevant. The Act also outlines situations where a person’s character is relevant, as covered in Sections 52 to 55.To summarise, Sections 5 to 55 of the Indian Evidence Act outline various methods through which the correlation between different facts can establish the concept of relevant facts. The relevance of a fact to another is determined based on the connections detailed in these sections. If such a connection is absent, the fact is considered irrelevant. However, a court has the authority to exclude pertinent evidence if the potential risks outweigh the probative value of the evidence. Such risks may encompass unfair prejudice, confusion of issues, misleading the jury, undue delays, or the unnecessary introduction of cumulative evidence.Judgments on Relevancy of Facts Lakshmandas Chaganlal Bhatia v. State The court established several relevant factors: Facts serve to elucidate or present the truth in question or a pertinent fact; they can support or challenge an inference proposed by a fact in issue or a relevant fact; they establish the character of a person or thing whose identity matters; they pinpoint the time and place of occurrence of a fact in issue or a significant event; and they reveal the relationship between parties involved in the execution of a fact in issue or a relevant fact. Section 9 of the Evidence Act, 1872, outlines specific facts that hold relevance. Another provision, Section 11, addresses circumstances where ordinarily insignificant facts become significant if they contradict relevant truths or make the presence or absence of a pertinent fact more likely or improbable. Sainudeen v. State of Kerala                                                                    This case deems facts valuable when they contribute to supporting, disproving, elucidating, or presenting crucial truths. For instance, consider a scenario where an individual goes into hiding shortly after being accused of a crime; this fact becomes pertinent as it is influenced by the circumstances surrounding the case. In this case, the identification of the accused through his voice was considered relevant and significant under this section.The current body of evidence law may not be well-suited to the demands of the contemporary era, necessitating reforms to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal system. It is crucial to establish a distinct boundary between the discretionary powers held by individual judges and the authority of the judicial collective. This demarcation is essential because unchecked empowerment of individual judges can potentially result in the misuse of their authority and power."

    "headline": "Basic Structure Doctrine of the Indian Constitution: Origin and Evolution",
    "data": "IntroductionThe concept of the “basic structure” doctrine in the Indian constitutional law represents a pivotal and influential element of the country’s legal framework. It significantly constrains the scope and extent to which amendments to the Indian Constitution can be made.In this article, we will delve deeply into the historical background, the legal development of the basic structure doctrine, and its immense significance in preserving the foundational principles of the Indian Constitution.Historical Context and Constitutional Framework of IndiaIndia, upon gaining independence in 1947, embarked on a journey to create a new democratic nation characterized by a written constitution. The constitutional framework established the principles of separation of powers and federalism, vesting authority in Parliament and state legislatures to enact laws within their defined jurisdictions.Parliament’s Legislative Power: The Constitution of India, in its initial form, conferred broad legislative powers upon Parliament. This implied that Parliament had the authority to amend the Constitution, subject to the stipulations laid down in Article 368.Role of the Judiciary: The judiciary was designated as the guardian of the Constitution. It was granted the power to adjudicate the constitutional validity of laws enacted by Parliament or state legislatures. If a law was found to transgress the Constitution, the Supreme Court had the authority to declare it null and void.Adaptability vs. Rigidity: The framers of the Constitution were keen to ensure that it could adapt to the evolving needs of the nation. They sought to create a constitution that was neither rigid nor too flexible, but one that could withstand the test of time. To facilitate this, the Constitution allowed for amendments through the process outlined in Article 368.Article 368 and the Powers of AmendmentArticle 368 of the Indian Constitution initially appeared to grant extensive powers of amendment to Parliament. It gave the impression that any part of the Constitution, including its fundamental provisions, could be amended. The judiciary, however, saw significant restrictions on this seemingly unrestrained power.Article 368: An Initial Impression The text of Article 368, especially in its earlier interpretations, seemingly implied that Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution without any restrictions.Supreme Court’s Interpretation: In practice, the Supreme Court played a crucial role in curbing the perception of the absolute amending powers of Parliament. It did so to safeguard the fundamental principles and ideals enshrined in the Constitution.The Pre-Kesavananda PositionBefore the landmark Kesavananda Bharati case, there were several instances where Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was tested and debated. One of the primary areas of contention revolved around the fundamental rights of citizens.Challenge to Parliament’s Authority: Early on, as soon as in 1951, Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution was questioned, particularly concerning the chapter on fundamental rights.Land Reform Laws: In the 1950s, states enacted laws aimed at reforming land ownership and tenancy structures. These laws were in alignment with the constitutional directive principles aimed at achieving equitable distribution of resources and preventing wealth concentration.Legal Challenges: Property owners affected by these laws challenged them in court, asserting that these reforms violated their fundamental right to property, a right guaranteed under the Constitution.Creation of the Ninth Schedule: In response to unfavorable judgements by the courts, Parliament, through the First and Fourth Amendments in 1951 and 1952, respectively, added the Ninth Schedule to the Constitution. This placed a significant number of laws related to land reforms beyond the scope of judicial review, citing the provisions of Article 31.Legal Challenge to the Ninth Schedule: Property owners once again contested these amendments that placed land reform laws in the Ninth Schedule. They argued that such placement violated Article 13(2) of the Constitution.Article 13(2): Protection of Fundamental Rights: Article 13(2) is a critical provision that safeguards the fundamental rights of citizens. It clearly prohibits Parliament and state legislatures from enacting laws that might infringe upon or diminish the fundamental rights guaranteed to citizens.Supreme Court’s Stance: In the Sankari Prasad Singh Deo v. Union of India case in 1952 and the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, the Supreme Court rejected both arguments. It upheld Parliament’s authority to amend any part of the Constitution, including aspects that impacted the fundamental rights of citizens.Dissenting Opinions: Notably, in the Sajjan Singh v. Rajasthan case, some dissenting judges raised doubts about whether fundamental rights could become subject to the will of the majority party in Parliament. The Golaknath Verdict (1967)The year 1967 marked a significant turning point in India’s constitutional history when the Supreme Court revisited its previous stance on the powers of Parliament to amend the Constitution.Change in the Supreme Court’s Position: In the Golaknath v. State of Punjab case (1967), an eleven-judge bench reversed the Supreme Court’s previous stance.Interpretation of Article 368: Chief Justice Subba Rao, in his majority judgement, introduced a novel interpretation of Article 368. He argued that Article 368 primarily laid down the amending procedure but did not actually confer upon Parliament the power to amend the Constitution.Implied Limitations: The majority judgement introduced the concept of implied limitations on Parliament’s amending powers. This perspective contended that the Constitution’s explicit and implicit provisions placed certain restrictions on the power of Parliament to amend it.Fundamental Rights as Fundamental: According to this majority view, the fundamental rights of citizens were of such paramount importance that they could not be restricted or curtailed, even if such a move were to receive unanimous approval from both houses of Parliament.The Significance of Golaknath: The Golaknath verdict introduced a novel legal interpretation and marked a dramatic shift from previous positions. It signaled a more cautious approach towards amending the Constitution, especially regarding fundamental rights. Kesavananda Bharati and the Origin of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe Golaknath judgement set the stage for the case of Kesavananda Bharati, which ultimately gave rise to the foundational concept of the “basic structure” of the Constitution.Kesavananda Bharati’s Case: Kesavananda Bharati, the head seer of the Edneer Mutt in Kerala, challenged the Kerala Land Reforms Act. He contended that his fundamental right to property was infringed upon by placing the land reform law in the Ninth Schedule, thereby placing it beyond the scope of judicial review.The Majority Judgement: The Kesavananda Bharati case resulted in a landmark judgement. The majority upheld Parliament’s authority to amend the Constitution but also imposed significant limitations on this power.Basic Structure Doctrine Emerges: This judgement gave birth to the “basic structure” doctrine, a doctrine that had a profound and enduring impact on Indian constitutional law. It essentially held that while Parliament had the authority to amend any part of the Constitution, it could not alter the Constitution’s “basic structure.”Elements of the Basic Structure: The Kesavananda Bharati judgement did not provide an exhaustive list of what constituted the basic structure. However, it did enumerate certain elements that were integral to this concept. These included the supremacy of the Constitution, federalism, secularism, democracy, separation of powers, the dignity of the individual, and the unity and integrity of the nation.The Significance of Kesavananda Bharati: This case and its resulting judgement fundamentally altered the dynamics of constitutional law in India. It placed certain features of the Constitution beyond the reach of Parliament. Even if Parliament followed the prescribed procedures under Article 368, if it violated the basic structure, the amendment would be declared invalid. This judgement was celebrated as a significant victory for the judiciary and the people, and it marked a limitation on the powers of the political executive. Application of the Basic Structure DoctrineThe basic structure doctrine, as laid down in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has been employed in various judicial decisions over the years, serving as a potent instrument to prevent the legislature from excessively altering the fundamental principles and values of the Constitution.Application in Legal Cases: The Supreme Court has consistently used the basic structure doctrine as a tool to safeguard the core principles of the Constitution.Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain (1975): One prominent instance of applying the basic structure doctrine was in the Indira Gandhi v. Raj Narain case. The court relied on this doctrine to declare the 39th Amendment of the Constitution invalid. This amendment was designed to shield Prime Minister Indira Gandhi from disqualification.Minerva Mills Case (1980): In the Minerva Mills case, the Supreme Court once again drew on the basic structure doctrine to strike down specific provisions of the 42nd Amendment. This amendment sought to grant Parliament extensive powers to alter any part of the Constitution.Preserving Constitutional Principles: These instances underscore how the basic structure doctrine serves as a guardian against potential abuse of power by the legislative branch. It functions as a safeguard, preventing the erosion of the foundational values and principles that underpin India’s democratic and constitutional framework. ConclusionThe basic structure doctrine has played a pivotal role in ensuring that the Indian Constitution remains a robust and adaptable document capable of withstanding the challenges posed by changing political landscapes and societal dynamics. It serves as a critical guardian, protecting the essence of India’s democratic and constitutional framework.Preserving Core Values: The basic structure doctrine ensures that the Constitution retains its fundamental principles and ideals while allowing for necessary amendments. It serves as a bulwark against the erosion of the Constitution’s foundational values.Protection Against Abuse of Power: The doctrine acts as a safeguard, preventing the legislative branch from overstepping its boundaries and altering the fundamental principles of the Constitution for short-term political gains.Integral to Constitutional Jurisprudence: The basic structure doctrine has become an integral and defining feature of India’s constitutional jurisprudence. It has stood the test of time, providing stability and coherence to the constitutional framework, thereby preserving the essence of India’s democracy.In conclusion, the basic structure doctrine, as established in the Kesavananda Bharati case, has emerged as a pivotal and enduring feature of India’s constitutional landscape. It limits the power of Parliament to amend the Constitution, preserving the foundational principles that are the bedrock of India’s democracy and constitutional order. This doctrine is a testament to the wisdom and foresight of the framers of the Indian Constitution, as well as the role of the judiciary in upholding its integrity."

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Sovereign Immunity and the Tortious Liability of State",
    "data": "IntroductionTortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for wrongful acts that cause harm to individuals or their property. Unlike criminal liability, which involves offenses against the state, tortious liability focuses on civil wrongs and the compensation of victims.In many legal systems, the state enjoys certain immunities, but exceptions exist where citizens can seek redress for injuries caused by the state’s actions. In this post, we will discuss Tortious Liability of the state and the immunity of the state in certain situations.What is Sovereign Immunity?Sovereign immunity is a legal doctrine that historically shielded the government or sovereign entity from being sued without its consent. This principle originated from the notion that the king or sovereign authority should not be subjected to the jurisdiction of its own courts. While sovereign immunity has ancient roots, its application has evolved over time, and many legal systems have modified or waived it to a certain extent.Absolute vs. Qualified Sovereign Immunity:Absolute Immunity: Historically, sovereign immunity was absolute, providing broad protection against lawsuits. This meant that the state could not be sued without its consent, regardless of the nature of the claim.Qualified Immunity: In contemporary legal systems, many jurisdictions have moved towards qualified immunity. This means that while the state retains a level of protection, it can be sued in specific circumstances or for certain types of claims. Qualified immunity is often subject to statutory provisions and limitations.Tortious Liability of the StateThe concept of state tort liability has evolved over time. Traditionally, the state enjoyed sovereign immunity, which shielded it from civil suits. However, as societies developed and notions of accountability and justice advanced, exceptions to sovereign immunity were introduced, allowing citizens to hold the state accountable for certain wrongful acts.Tortious liability of the state refers to the legal responsibility of the government or state entities for civil wrongs, or torts, committed by their agents or representatives. This liability allows individuals to seek compensation when they suffer harm, injury, or property damage due to the negligent or intentional actions of the state or its employees.Historically, India adhered to the doctrine of sovereign immunity, but this has been significantly modified. The government can be sued for its actions in areas where it has expressly waived immunity, such as contract disputes or certain tortious claims.Article 300 of the Indian Constitution provides that the Government of India and the governments of the states may sue or be sued by the name of the Union of India and the States, respectively. This lays the foundation for the state’s liability in civil cases.Types of Tortious LiabilityTortious liability encompasses a variety of civil wrongs, or torts, for which an individual or entity can be held legally responsible. Here are some common types of tortious liability of state1. Negligence:Definition: The state can be held liable for negligence when its actions or inactions fall below the standard of care, resulting in harm to individuals or property.Example: Failure to maintain public infrastructure leading to accidents.2. Nuisance:Definition: State activities that cause unreasonable interference with an individual’s use and enjoyment of their property may lead to liability for nuisance.Example: Government construction projects causing excessive noise or pollution.3. Defamation:Definition: The state can be held liable for making false statements that harm the reputation of individuals or entities.Example: Government officials making false statements about a private citizen.4. Assault and Battery:Definition: Liability may arise if state employees engage in intentional harmful actions, such as assault or battery.Example: Excessive use of force by law enforcement officers.5. False Imprisonment:Definition: The state may be liable for wrongfully restraining the freedom of an individual.Example: Unlawful arrest or detention by government agents.6. Breach of Statutory Duty:Definition: Liability may arise when the state breaches a duty imposed by statute, leading to harm.Example: Failure to comply with safety regulations, resulting in injuries.7. Environmental Tort:Definition: Liability for harm caused by the state’s actions that result in environmental pollution or degradation.Example: Improper disposal of toxic waste by a government agency.Landmark Cases on Tortious Liability of StateThe Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa case is a landmark judgment in Indian legal history that addressed issues related to custodial deaths and the liability of the state for violations of fundamental rights. The case gained significance for establishing the right to compensation for victims of custodial violence or their legal heirs.he primary legal issue in this case was whether the state could be held liable for the custodial death of an individual. Nilabati Behera argued that her son’s fundamental rights under Articles 21 and 22 of the Constitution were violated, and sought compensation from the state for its failure to protect those rights.The court held that the state is vicariously liable for the actions of its employees, including the police. It stated that custodial violence is a serious violation of human rights, and the state cannot plead sovereign immunity for such actions.M.C. Mehta v. Union of India is a landmark case in Indian environmental law that played a crucial role in shaping the legal framework for environmental protection. The case involved issues related to the operation of industries in and around the Taj Trapezium Zone, an ecologically sensitive area near the Taj Mahal in Agra.The primary legal issues in the case included the protection of the environment and the cultural heritage of the Taj Mahal. M.C. Mehta argued that the operation of industries within the TTZ was leading to air pollution and posed a threat to the preservation of the monument.The court emphasized the application of the public trust doctrine, asserting that natural resources, including the environment, are held in trust by the state for the benefit of the public, and the state is obligated to protect these resources.State of Rajasthan v. Vidyawati is a landmark judgment that laid the foundation for the doctrine of sovereign immunity in India. It involved a fatal accident caused by a government-owned bus in the state of Rajasthan. The primary legal issue was whether the State could be sued for tortious acts committed by its servants while performing governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such lawsuits, relying on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court held that the State is immune when its employees act in the discharge of sovereign functions. Sovereign functions were broadly defined to include activities that are essential for the normal functioning of the government, such as maintenance of law and order and administration of justice.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its servants in certain situations, especially when they are acting in the course of their employment.The case of Kasturi Lal Ralia Ram Jain v. State of Uttar Pradesh is a significant case in India that deals with the concept of sovereign immunity in the context of governmental functions.The primary legal issue was whether the State could be held liable for the tortious acts committed by its employees while engaged in governmental functions. The State argued that it was immune from such liability based on the principle of sovereign immunity.The Court clarified that the State could be vicariously liable for the acts of its employees if those acts are committed in the course of their employment and in the discharge of governmental functions.ConclusionTortious liability of the state represents a crucial aspect of government accountability, balancing the rights of individuals with the need to protect the state’s ability to function effectively. Legal frameworks continue to evolve to address the complexities of holding the state accountable for its actions."

Improve your score in the exam and secure a seat in the college of your dreams by practicing Evidence law questions for CLAT today!PASSAGE 1The Supreme Court, on Tuesday, reversed a conviction recorded by the Trial Court, affirmed by the Tripura High Court on the ground that major links of the chain of circumstances had not been proved by the prosecution evidence in a case based on circumstantial evidence.A Bench comprising Justice B.R. Gavai and Justice Vikram Nath was of the opinion that in the facts and circumstances of the present case, where a case based on circumstances evidence was not made out, it would be unjust to uphold the conviction. Considering the same, the Bench noted that the accused is entitled to the benefit of the doubt. It acquitted the accused of all charges and directed them to release him. It is pertinent to note that though, as on Tuesday, the accused was in judicial custody, he has been granted parole by the State.The police, having been informed that blood was seen on the road, reached the location to find a vojali (big knife), a taga (thread) and some broken pieces of glass which appeared to be of the rear-view mirror of a motorcycle. The police noticed visible marks of dragging some heavy objects in the jungle on the side of the concerned road. While they were carrying out their investigation, one Arjun Das informed the police station that his nephew Kaushik Sarkar had been missing since the previous evening. The police recorded the statement of Kaushik’s mother who informed them that on the previous evening, he had gone out with two of his friends (including the appellant Indrajit Das). According to the prosecution, the two friends had confessed before the Investigating Officer that they had accompanied the deceased on his bike the evening he went missing. As per the Investigating Officer, the two friends assaulted Kaushik with vojalis dragged his dead body and the motorcycle to the nearby river and threw them into the river. One of the accused was tried as a juvenile, while Indrajit faced a regular trial. At the trial, Indrajit pleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried. The Trial Court convicted him for offences punishable under Section 302, 34 of the Indian Penal Code and sentenced him to life imprisonment and allied sentences to run concurrently. The High Court dismissed the appeal noting that the prosecution has been successful in proving charges beyond reasonable doubt.In the present case, the dead body has not been recovered. Only a limb was recovered but no DNA testing was carried out to establish that the limb was that of the deceased Kaushik Sarkar. As such the entire case of the prosecution proceeds on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar has died.At the threshold, the Court noted that the case is of circumstantial evidence and ought to fulfil the two-fold requirements –“The basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances.”The Court noted that the prosecution had not established a motive as to why the accused had committed the crime. It observed that the Trial Court and the High Court had also not recorded a finding on motive. The Court was of the opinion that motive carries a much greater importance in a case based on circumstantial evidence than one of direct evidence. In this regard, the Court referred to the judgments in Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha (2018) 1 SCC 296 and Ranganayaki v. State of Inspector of Police (2004) 12 SCC 521.The dead body had not been recovered and the present case was based on the presumption that Kaushik Sarkar had died. No DNA test was carried out for the limb that was recovered. Referring to the principle of corpus delicti the Court stated that there are judgments on both sides – a conviction can be recorded in the absence of recovery of corpus and no conviction can be recorded in the absence of corpus. The reason behind the latter view is that if the corpus is alive then one has to undergo a sentence without having committed any offence. The Court recorded that the non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances.The Court noted that Kaushik’s mother had stated that upon enquiry he had told her that he was going out with the accused. Following Kaushik to the gate, she had also seen the two friends. However, in her cross-examination, she had denied making any such statement, though she conceded that she had told the Investigating Officer that she had seen the accused at her gate.As per the extrajudicial confession of the accused before the Investigating Officer, Kaushik Sarkar met them while they were waiting near a bazaar. The Court noted that if the extrajudicial confession was to be accepted then the last-seen theory of the mother would fall apart. The Court opined that the statement of the mother was an attempt to develop the last-seen theory. Moreover, the Court observed that –“The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful.”The recoveries were made from an open place and could not have been in the exclusive and special knowledge of the accused persons.Indrajit Das v. State of Tripura|2023 LiveLaw (SC) 152 |Criminal Appeal No. 609 of 2015|28th February, 2023|Justice B.R. Gavai v. Justice Vikram NathFor Appellant(s) Ms. Madhumita Bhattacharjee, AOR Ms. Urmila Kar Purkayastha, Adv. Ms. Srija Choudhury, Adv. Ms. Piyali Paul, Adv. Ms. Arushi Mishra, Adv.For Respondent(s) Mr. Shuvodeep Roy, AORIndian Evidence Act 1872- Circumstantial Evidence- Every link in the chain of circumstances necessary to establish the guilt of the accused must be established beyond a reasonable doubt- All the circumstances must be consistently pointing towards the guilt of the accused- Para 10.Indian Evidence Act 1872- In a case of circumstantial evidence, motive has an important role to play. It is an important link in the chain of circumstances basic links in the chain of circumstances start with motive, then move on to last seen theory, recovery, medical evidence, expert opinions if any and any other additional link which may be part of the chain of circumstances – Para 12, 15Indian Evidence Act 1872- Murder trial -the principle of corpus delicti- non-recovery of the corpse would have relevance in considering the links of the chain of circumstances -Para 16.Indian Evidence Act 1872 -Extra-judicial confession-The extra-judicial confession is a weak piece of evidence especially when it has been retracted during trial. It requires strong evidence to corroborate it and also it must be established that it was completely voluntary and truthful – Para 21QUESTIONSOptions:a) The defence argues that circumstantial evidence alone should suffice, and the court should not place undue importance on establishing a motive.b) Analysing the court’s position, the defence emphasises that the lack of a motive weakens the entire case, making it essential for the prosecution to prove each link in the chain of circumstances beyond reasonable doubt.c) The defence contends that the court’s reference to cases like Kuna Alias Sanjaya Behera v. State of Odisha is irrelevant, and establishing a motive is an outdated requirement in modern legal contexts.d) The defence suggests that motive is only crucial in cases with direct evidence, and circumstantial evidence should be evaluated independently.e) The defence, not directly challenging the court’s stance, argues that motive is a subjective element and can be open to interpretation, making it an unreliable aspect of the prosecution’s case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The defence leverages the court’s position on establishing a motive, emphasising that the absence of a motive weakens the prosecution’s case, requiring a stringent standard of proof for each link in the chain of circumstances.Question 2: As a legal consultant, you are asked to assess the implications of the court’s interpretation of the principle of corpus delicti in the case of Indrajit Das. The prosecution relied on the presumption of Kaushik Sarkar’s death despite only a limb being recovered, and no DNA testing was conducted. In your analysis, discuss how the court’s view on the principle of corpus delicti impacts cases where the dead body is not recovered. Provide recommendations on how future legal strategies could address this issue.Options:a) The court’s interpretation of corpus delicti suggests that the absence of a recovered corpse is inconsequential, and future legal strategies should prioritize circumstantial evidence over physical evidence.b) Analysing the court’s stance, it is evident that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.c) The court’s perspective implies that the recovery of the corpse is only crucial in cases with weak circumstantial evidence, guiding future strategies to emphasise direct evidence.d) Conflicting judgements on the relevance of a recovered corpse indicate a lack of clarity in legal principles, urging legal practitioners to advocate for a standardised approach in such cases.e) The court’s position does not provide clear guidance on addressing the absence of a recovered corpse in future cases, leaving room for legal professionals to interpret its relevance based on the specifics of each case.Explanation: Option (b) is correct. The court’s view on corpus delicti implies that the absence of a recovered corpse is a significant gap, and future legal strategies should focus on establishing alternative forms of evidence to compensate for this deficiency.Question 3: Assume you are advising the defence team for Indrajit Das. The court emphasized the weakness of extrajudicial confessions, especially when retracted during trial.

    "headline": "Local Self-Government in India: An In-Depth Overview",
    "data": "IntroductionLocal self-government in India serves as the bedrock of governance, addressing the unique needs and challenges of specific local areas within the broader framework of the nation. Its functions include:Maintaining law and order.Enhancing healthcare standards.Ensuring the development of essential infrastructure like feeder roads and drainage systems.The 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments have been instrumental in recognizing the significance of local self-governments and delegating their powers and responsibilities.Three Levels of Government in IndiaIndia’s governance structure operates across three tiers, reflecting its federal character.The Union government is the highest level of government, encompassing the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. It is governed by the Constitution of India.Each state in India has its own government, led by a Chief Minister. State governments handle matters specific to their regions, ensuring localized governance.Local government serves as the lowest tier, concentrating on the resolution of regional issues within a more significant state or national framework. Empowered by the 73rd and 74th constitutional amendments, local governments are essential to promoting grassroots development.Local Government Levels: Urban and Rural Local government entities in India are broadly categorized into urban and rural bodies, each serving its respective domain.Urban Local Governance BodiesThree democratically elected urban local governance bodies play a crucial role in urban development:This is the highest urban local governance body responsible for governing large cities and metropolitan areas.Municipal councils cater to smaller urban areas and towns, addressing their unique needs.Municipal committees are responsible for governing smaller municipalities and townships.Rural Local Governance BodiesPanchayati Raj institutions (PRIs) form the backbone of rural local governance, consisting of three hierarchical tiers:At the grassroots level, Gram Panchayats focus on village-level governance and development.Operating at the district level, Zila Parishads oversee the planning and resource allocation for PRIs, ensuring integrated development efforts.At the community block level, Panchayat Samiti facilitates governance and development initiatives, acting as intermediaries between Gram Panchayats and Zila Parishads.73rd Constitutional Amendment: Empowering Rural Local Bodies Article 40 of the Constitution, enshrining a Directive Principle of State Policy, stipulates that the state should take measures to organize village panchayats and empower them with the necessary powers and authority to function as units of self-government.In response to Article 40, a new Part IX was introduced in the Constitution, which focuses on panchayats. Some key features of the 73rd constitutional amendment, enacted in 1992 during the tenure of Prime Minister Narasimha Rao include:-The constitution of Panchayats at village and other levelsThe establishment of Gram Panchayat in villages or groups of villages.Direct elections for all seats in panchayats at the village and intermediate levels, if applicable, and for the offices of chairpersons at these levels.Reservation of seats for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes in proportion to their population for Panchayat membership and Chairpersons’ positions at each level. Additionally, not less than one-third of the seats are reserved for women.Fixing a five-year tenure for panchayats and requiring elections within six months in the event of any panchayat’s super session.This constitutional framework underscores the importance of local self-governance in rural areas, emphasizing democracy and empowerment at the grassroots level.Article 243-G of the Indian Constitution made it mandatory for state governments to devolve powers, responsibilities, and authority to the Panchayats, ensuring greater local autonomy.74th Constitutional Amendment: Strengthening Urban Local Bodies Municipal bodies have a significant historical presence in India. The first municipal corporation was established in the former Presidency Town of Madras in 1688. This pioneering effort was followed by the establishment of similar corporations in Bombay and Calcutta in 1726.In 1993, the 74th Constitutional Amendment followed suit to empower urban local bodies and ensure the decentralization of union and state powers. It introduced several significant provisions addressing municipal issues:\nPart IXA in the Constitution\nThe Constitution (Seventy Fourth Amendment) Act, 1992, introduced Part IXA, specifically addresses municipal issues and the devolution of powers to urban local bodies.\nRole of Zila Parishad\nAt the district level, Zila Parishad was entrusted with the vital role of planning and allocating resources for Panchayati Raj institutions, ensuring coordinated development efforts.ConclusionIndia operates as a federal republic with a three-tiered government structure comprising the union, state, and local levels. The Union government functions at the highest echelon, dealing with national affairs, while state governments manage regional matters. Local government, empowered by the Constitution (74th Amendment) Act, 1992, serves as the foundation for addressing specific local area concerns and promoting decentralized governance. It plays a crucial role in ensuring that governance is responsive to the unique needs of local communities, thereby contributing to the nation’s overall development."

    "headline": "Public Interest Litigation in India",
    "data": "IntroductionIn India, public interest litigation (PIL) has developed as an effective weapon for securing social justice and protecting the rights of the marginalized and impoverished. PIL, which was created by Justices Krishna Iyer and PN Bhagwati, permits people or organizations to approach the courts on behalf of persons who are unable to seek legal remedies on their own. This post in our administrative law series delves at the history and idea of PIL, the relationship between PIL and writs, the filing process, notable case laws, and the relationship between PIL and the Right to Information Act, 2005.History of Public Interest LitigationIn the 1980s, the establishment of Public Interest Litigation in India signified a substantial change from the old legal system, which needed a directly affected party with locus standi to approach the courts. PIL was inspired by comparable schemes in the United States of America, where public interest litigation had gained traction as a tool for addressing social injustices and protecting the rights of marginalized populations.Due to the constraints of the current legal structure in India, the need for a wider approach to litigation became obvious. The traditional condition of locus standi meant that only people who were directly affected by a breach of their rights may seek remedy in the courts. This was a tremendous challenge for individuals or groups that suffered social, economic, or educational disadvantages and were unable to manage the legal system’s intricacies.Recognizing the need for a more comprehensive and accessible legal remedy, the Indian judiciary pioneered the notion of PIL, headed by Justice Krishna Iyer and Justice PN Bhagwati. PIL broadened the scope of legal standing by allowing people or organizations to submit petitions on behalf of those who faced legal impediments. These obstacles might be caused by illiteracy, poverty, a lack of knowledge, or social disadvantage. PIL allowed concerned citizens to act as advocates and seek redress for structural concerns and social injustices affecting a broader part of the community.Characteristics of Public Interest LitigationThe Function of Writs in Filing a PILWrits are legal orders issued by courts to defend basic rights, uphold the rule of law, and ensure that public officials carry out their responsibilities. The relationship between writs and PIL is crucial, as PIL frequently entails the filing of writ petitions to address topics of public concern and safeguard the public’s interests.In PIL cases in India, there are five sorts of writs that can be used: habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, certiorari, and quo warranto.Landmark Case Laws on PILSeveral landmark cases have played an important role in defining Indian law on Public Interest Litigation. These decisions established significant precedents and concepts that influence the implementation and efficacy of PIL. Here are a few noteworthy examples:Union of India v. People’s Union for Democratic Rights: This landmark case addressed the problem of cruel working conditions and low salaries for Asian Games workers. The Supreme Court recognized the reality of bonded labour, emphasizing the need of preserving workers’ rights. The case drew attention to the condition of workers and emphasized the need of protecting their fundamental rights.Union of India v. Bandhua Mukti Morcha: This notable case included the exploitation of bonded labourers working in a mine in Faridkot, Haryana, under terrible conditions. After a PIL was filed, the Supreme Court ruled that refusal to pay minimum wages constituted compelled labour, emphasising the violation of basic rights. The case drew attention to the issue of bonded labour and emphasised the importance of abolishing such practises.Union of India v. MC Mehta: This significant case demonstrated the importance and effectiveness of PIL in environmental preservation. The Supreme Court adopted rules broadening the scope of PIL, including accepting letters as PIL petitions. The case also established the court’s competence to award victims compensation and to form commissions to investigate violations of basic rights. It also emphasized the need of public-private partnerships in resolving environmental problems and respecting the rights of impacted persons and communities.PIL and Right to Information Act, 2005PIL and the Right to Information Act (RTI) collaborate to promote transparency, accountability, and participatory government in India. PIL protects the public interest and forces systemic change, whereas the RTI Act allows people to get information from public bodies. They both contribute to a transparent society and hold authority accountable for their activities.PIL permits anybody to file petitions on problems of public concern, such as constitutional rights infringement and systemic challenges. It exposes mismanagement, corruption, and human rights violations while encouraging accountability and good government. Meanwhile, the RTI Act gives individuals access to information, allowing them to make educated decisions and hold government officials responsible. It promotes openness by requiring public entities to share information and react to requests on a proactive basis.The link between PIL and the RTI Act is their emphasis on information access. To support allegations, PIL frequently relies on information received under the RTI Act. The RTI Act is critical in PIL lawsuits because it allows individuals to obtain evidence to back up their allegations. PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote openness, accountability, and citizen involvement.PIL and the RTI Act work together to promote a more equitable and inclusive society. They provide citizens the capacity to actively participate in governance, exercise their rights, and demand accountability. PIL targets systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act offers the required information for informed decision-making. This collaboration enhances both processes, increasing openness and accountability.In conclusion, public interest litigation and the RTI Act are essential components of India’s legal structure, encouraging openness, accountability, and participatory government. It protects the public interest and resolves systemic concerns, whereas the RTI Act gives citizens access to information. "

    "headline": "Detailed Notes on Article 26 of Indian Constitution",
    "data": "IntroductionArticle 26 of the Indian Constitution, under Part III that deals with fundamental rights, addresses the right to manage religious affairs. It grants freedom to every religious denomination or any section thereof, subject to public order, morality, and health, to manage its religious affairs. It ensures that religious communities have the autonomy to manage their religious institutions and matters pertaining to their faith without external interference.Article 26 plays a vital role in upholding India’s secular fabric by ensuring religious diversity and freedom. It safeguards the plurality of beliefs and practices, enabling various religious communities to manage their religious affairs independently.Scope and Application of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionArticle 26 grants the right to religious denominations, sections, or groups to manage their religious affairs, which encompasses the right to establish and maintain religious institutions, manage their properties, and administer their rituals, ceremonies, and customs.It ensures that religious organizations have the freedom to conduct and regulate their religious practices, manage their internal affairs, and govern their religious properties without undue interference from the state or other external entities.The freedom to manage religious affairs is subject to certain limitations. Article 26 specifies that this right is subject to public order, morality, and health, implying that the exercise of this right should not infringe upon these essential considerations.The limitation clause allows the state to regulate religious practices that may pose a threat to public order, morality, or health. It enables the state to balance the rights of religious denominations with the broader societal interests and necessities.Judicial Interpretation of Article 26 of Indian ConstitutionOver the years, the Indian judiciary has played a crucial role in interpreting and delineating the scope and application of Article 26. Various landmark judgments, including cases related to the management of religious institutions, have helped define the boundaries of this fundamental right.Courts have often grappled with balancing the autonomy of religious denominations and the state’s interest in regulating religious institutions. They aim to ensure that religious freedoms are protected without compromising the welfare of the society at large.This case involved the management and administration of the Shirur Mutt, a religious institution. The Supreme Court, in its judgment, elucidated on the scope of religious practices and the autonomy of religious denominations. The court held that the state could not interfere with religious practices unless they were found to be of a secular character and not essential religious practices.In this case, the court deliberated on the issue of religious practices and their interference by the state. The Supreme Court emphasized that the state should not interfere in religious affairs unless the practices were in violation of public order, morality, or health. The judgment reinforced the autonomy of religious institutions in managing their internal affairs.The case involved a dispute over the management of the Durgah. The court ruled that the practice of removing a Sajjadanashin by a court order is impermissible. It emphasized that religious denominations have the right to manage their religious institutions and that the state should refrain from interfering unless there are substantial reasons.In this case, the Supreme Court ruled that the management of religious institutions, including properties and rituals, is the exclusive right of the religious denomination. The judgment affirmed that state intervention should be minimal and only in exceptional circumstances where public order, morality, or health is threatened. The Supreme Court decision was on whether the restrictions on entry into temples for some sections, were “ essential part of the Hindu religion”. It held that such practices are unconstitutional and void, and opened the temples for all Hindus.ConclusionIn conclusion, Article 26 of the Indian Constitution is a crucial provision that safeguards the right of religious denominations to manage their religious affairs. It upholds the autonomy of diverse religious groups, allowing them to practice, preserve, and propagate their faith and traditions.While ensuring religious freedom, it also acknowledges the state’s legitimate interests in maintaining public order, morality, and health. The article serves as a cornerstone in protecting India’s religious diversity and pluralistic ethos, while also posing challenges in reconciling conflicting interests and social reforms in the context of religious practices and institutions.Also Read: Notes on Article 25 of Indian Constitution"
